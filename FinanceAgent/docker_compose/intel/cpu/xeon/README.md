## Overview

This guide focuses on running the pre-configured Finance Agent service using Docker Compose on Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors. It runs with OpenAI LLM models, along with containers for other microservices like embedding, retrieval, data preparation and the UI.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors on-prem or from the cloud.
- If running OpenAI models, generate the API key by following these [instructions](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). If using a remote server i.e. for LLM text generation, have the base URL and API key ready from the cloud service provider or owner of the on-prem machine.
- Git installed (for cloning repository).
- Hugging Face Hub API Token (for downloading models).
- Access to the internet (or a private model cache).
- Finnhub API Key. Go to https://docs.financialdatasets.ai/ to get your free api key.
- Financial Datasets API Key. Go to https://docs.financialdatasets.ai/ to get your free api key.

Clone the GenAIExamples repository:

```bash
mkdir /path/to/your/workspace/
export WORKDIR=/path/to/your/workspace/
cd $WORKDIR
git clone https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIExamples.git
cd GenAIExamples/FinanceAgent/docker_compose/intel/cpu/xeon
```

## Start Deployment

By default, it will run models from OpenAI.

### Configure Environment

Set required environment variables in your shell:

```bash
# Path to your model cache
export HF_CACHE_DIR="./data"
# Some models from Hugging Face require approval beforehand. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access them.
export HF_TOKEN="your_huggingface_token"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export FINNHUB_API_KEY="your-finnhub-api-key"
export FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY="your-financial-datasets-api-key"

# Configure HOST_IP
# Replace with your host's external IP address (do not use localhost or 127.0.0.1).
export HOST_IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')

# Optional: Configure proxy if needed
# export HTTP_PROXY="${http_proxy}"
# export HTTPS_PROXY="${https_proxy}"
# export NO_PROXY="${NO_PROXY},${HOST_IP}"

source set_env.sh
```

Note: The compose file might read additional variables from `set_env.sh`. Ensure all required variables like ports (LLM_SERVICE_PORT, TEI_EMBEDDER_PORT, etc.) are set if not using defaults from the compose file. For instance, edit the `set_env.sh` or overwrite LLM_MODEL_ID to change the LLM model.

### [Optional] Running LLM models with remote endpoints

When models are deployed on a remote server, a base URL and an API key are required to access them. To set up a remote server and acquire the base URL and API key, refer to [Intel® AI for Enterprise Inference](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/enterprise-ai.html) offerings.

Set the following environment variables.

- `REMOTE_ENDPOINT` is the HTTPS endpoint of the remote server with the model of choice (i.e. https://api.inference.denvrdata.com). **Note:** If not using LiteLLM, the second part of the model card needs to be appended to the URL i.e. `/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` from `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`.
- `OPENAI_LLM_MODEL_ID` is the model card which may need to be overwritten depending on what it is set to `set_env.sh`.

```bash
export REMOTE_ENDPOINT=<https-endpoint-of-remote-server>
export OPENAI_LLM_MODEL_ID=<model-card>
```

`OPENAI_API_KEY` should already be set in the previous step.

After setting these environment variables, run `docker compose` by adding `compose_remote.yaml` as an additional YAML file in the [next step](#optional-option-2-deploy-with-docker-compose-for-models-on-a-remote-server).

### Start Services

The following services will be launched:

- tei-embedding-serving
- redis-vector-db
- redis-kv-store
- dataprep-redis-server-finance
- finqa-agent-endpoint
- research-agent-endpoint
- docsum-vllm-xeon
- supervisor-agent-endpoint
- agent-ui

Follow **ONE** option below to deploy these services.

#### Option 1: Deploy with Docker Compose for OpenAI Models

```bash
docker compose -f compose_openai.yaml up -d
```

#### [Optional] Option 2: Deploy with Docker Compose for Models on a Remote Server

```bash
docker compose -f compose_openai.yaml -f compose_remote.yaml up -d
```

#### [Optional] Build docker images

This is only needed if the Docker image is unavailable or the pull operation fails.

```bash
cd $WORKDIR/GenAIExamples/FinanceAgent/docker_image_build
# get GenAIComps repo
git clone https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIComps.git
# build the images
docker compose -f build.yaml build --no-cache
```

## Validate Services

Wait several minutes for models to download and services to initialize. Check container logs with this command:

```bash
docker compose logs -f <service_name>.
```

### Validate Data Services

Ingest data and retrieval from database

```bash
python3 $WORKDIR/GenAIExamples/FinanceAgent/tests/test_redis_finance.py --port 6007 --test_option ingest
python3 $WORKDIR/GenAIExamples/FinanceAgent/tests/test_redis_finance.py --port 6007 --test_option get
```

### Validate Agents

FinQA Agent:

```bash
export agent_port="9095"
prompt="What is Gap's revenue in 2024?"
python3 $WORKDIR/GenAIExamples/FinanceAgent/tests/test.py --prompt "$prompt" --agent_role "worker" --ext_port $agent_port
```

Research Agent:

```bash
export agent_port="9096"
prompt="generate NVDA financial research report"
python3 $WORKDIR/GenAIExamples/FinanceAgent/tests/test.py --prompt "$prompt" --agent_role "worker" --ext_port $agent_port --tool_choice "get_current_date" --tool_choice "get_share_performance"
```

Supervisor Agent single turns:

```bash
export agent_port="9090"
python3 $WORKDIR/GenAIExamples/FinanceAgent/tests/test.py --agent_role "supervisor" --ext_port $agent_port --stream
```

Supervisor Agent multi turn:

```bash
python3 $WORKDIR/GenAIExamples/FinanceAgent/tests/test.py --agent_role "supervisor" --ext_port $agent_port --multi-turn --stream
```

## Accessing the User Interface (UI)

The UI microservice is launched in the previous step with the other microservices.
To see the UI, open a web browser to `http://${HOST_IP}:5175` to access the UI. Note the `HOST_IP` here is the host IP of the UI microservice.

1. Create Admin Account with a random value

2. Enter the endpoints in the `Connections` settings

   First, click on the user icon in the upper right corner to open `Settings`. Click on `Admin Settings`. Click on `Connections`.

   Then, enter the supervisor agent endpoint in the `OpenAI API` section: `http://${HOST_IP}:9090/v1`. Enter the API key as "empty". Add an arbitrary model id in `Model IDs`, for example, "opea_agent". The `HOST_IP` here should be the host ip of the agent microservice.

   Then, enter the dataprep endpoint in the `Icloud File API` section. You first need to enable `Icloud File API` by clicking on the button on the right to turn it into green and then enter the endpoint url, for example, `http://${HOST_IP}:6007/v1`. The `HOST_IP` here should be the host ip of the dataprep microservice.

   You should see screen like the screenshot below when the settings are done.

3. Upload documents with UI

   Click on the `Workplace` icon in the top left corner. Click `Knowledge`. Click on the "+" sign to the right of `iCloud Knowledge`. You can paste an url in the left hand side of the pop-up window, or upload a local file by click on the cloud icon on the right hand side of the pop-up window. Then click on the `Upload Confirm` button. Wait till the processing is done and the pop-up window will be closed on its own when the data ingestion is done. See the screenshot below.
   Then, enter the dataprep endpoint in the `iCloud File API` section. You first need to enable `iCloud File API` by clicking on the button on the right to turn it into green and then enter the endpoint url, for example, `http://${HOST_IP}:6007/v1`. The `HOST_IP` here should be the host ip of the dataprep microservice.
   Note: the data ingestion may take a few minutes depending on the length of the document. Please wait patiently and do not close the pop-up window.

4. Test agent with UI

   After the settings are done and documents are ingested, you can start to ask questions to the agent. Click on the `New Chat` icon in the top left corner, and type in your questions in the text box in the middle of the UI.

   The UI will stream the agent's response tokens. You need to expand the `Thinking` tab to see the agent's reasoning process. After the agent made tool calls, you would also see the tool output after the tool returns output to the agent. Note: it may take a while to get the tool output back if the tool execution takes time.
