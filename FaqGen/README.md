# FAQ Generation Application

In today's data-driven world, organizations across various industries face the challenge of managing and understanding vast amounts of information. Legal documents, contracts, regulations, and customer inquiries often contain critical insights buried within dense text. Extracting and presenting these insights in a concise and accessible format is crucial for decision-making, compliance, and customer satisfaction.

Our FAQ Generation Application leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to revolutionize the way you interact with and comprehend complex textual data. By harnessing cutting-edge natural language processing techniques, our application can automatically generate comprehensive and natural-sounding frequently asked questions (FAQs) from your documents, legal texts, customer queries, and other sources. In this example use case, we utilize LangChain to implement FAQ Generation and facilitate LLM inference using Text Generation Inference on Intel Xeon and Gaudi2 processors.
