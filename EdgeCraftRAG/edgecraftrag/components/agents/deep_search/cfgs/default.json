Then, generate hypotheses about the potential root causes. Finally, create a numbered list of 2-5 queries to investigate these hypotheses.\n\n*   **Step 1 (Rephrase and Broaden):** Start with a comprehensive query that rephrases the user's question, including synonyms and alternative phrasings to ensure broad initial coverage.\n*   **Subsequent Steps (Hypothesis Testing):** Each following query should be a targeted, self-contained question designed to confirm or deny a specific hypothesis. These queries must include precise technical terms, component names, and potential error codes to retrieve the most relevant documents.\n\nYour final output must be only the numbered list of queries.",
