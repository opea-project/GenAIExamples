# Example DBQnA Deployment on Intel® Xeon® Platform

This document outlines the deployment process for DBQnA application which helps generating a SQL query and its output given a NLP question, utilizing the [GenAIComps](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIComps.git) microservice pipeline on an Intel Xeon server.

## DBQnA Quick Start Deployment

This section describes how to quickly deploy and test the DBQnA service manually on Intel® Xeon® platform. The basic steps are:

1. [Access the Code](#access-the-code)
2. [Generate a HuggingFace Access Token](#generate-a-huggingface-access-token)
3. [Configure the Deployment Environment](#configure-the-deployment-environment)
4. [Deploy the Service Using Docker Compose](#deploy-the-service-using-docker-compose)
5. [Check the Deployment Status](#check-the-deployment-status)
6. [Test the Pipeline](#test-the-pipeline)
7. [Cleanup the Deployment](#cleanup-the-deployment)

### Access the Code

Clone the GenAIExample repository and access the DBQnA Intel® Xeon® platform Docker Compose files and supporting scripts:

```
git clone https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIExamples.git
cd GenAIExamples/DBQnA/docker_compose/intel/cpu/xeon/
```

Checkout a released version, such as v1.3:

```
git checkout v1.3
```

### Generate a HuggingFace Access Token

Some HuggingFace resources, such as some models, are only accessible if you have an access token. If you do not already have a HuggingFace access token, you can create one by first creating an account by following the steps provided at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) and then generating a [user access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/guides/private#step-1-generating-a-user-access-token).

### Configure the Deployment Environment

To set up environment variables for deploying DBQnA service, source the set_env.sh script in this directory:

```
source set_env.sh
```

The set*env.sh script will prompt for required and optional environment variables used to configure the DBQnA service. If a value is not entered, the script will use a default value for the same. It will also generate a *.env\_ file defining the desired configuration.

### Deploy the Service Using Docker Compose

To deploy the DBQnA service, execute the `docker compose up` command with the appropriate arguments. For a default deployment, execute:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The DBQnA docker images should automatically be downloaded from the `OPEA registry` and deployed on the Intel® Xeon® Platform:

```

### Check the Deployment Status

After running docker compose, check if all the containers launched via docker compose have started:

```
docker ps -a
```

For the default deployment, the following 5 containers should be running:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                                                       COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES

### Test the Pipeline

Once the DBQnA service are running, test the pipeline using the following command:

```bash
curl http://${host_ip}:9090/v1/text2sql\
    -X POST \
    -d '{"input_text": "Find the total number of Albums.","conn_str": {"user": "'${POSTGRES_USER}'","password": "'${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}'","host": "'${host_ip}'", "port": "5442", "database": "'${POSTGRES_DB}'"}}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### Cleanup the Deployment

To stop the containers associated with the deployment, execute the following command:

```
docker compose -f compose.yaml down
```

```
[+] Running 5/5
 ✔ Container postgres-container          Removed                                                                 0.5s
