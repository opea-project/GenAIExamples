# Instruction Tuning

Instruction tuning is the process of further training LLMs on a dataset consisting of (instruction, output) pairs in a supervised fashion, which bridges the gap between the next-word prediction objective of LLMs and the users' objective of having LLMs adhere to human instructions.

## Deploy Instruction Tuning Service

### Deploy Instruction Tuning Service on Xeon

Refer to the [Xeon Guide](./docker_compose/intel/cpu/xeon/README.md) for detail.

### Deploy Instruction Tuning Service on Gaudi

Refer to the [Gaudi Guide](./docker_compose/intel/hpu/gaudi/README.md) for detail.

## Consume Instruction Tuning Service

### 1. Upload a training file

Download a training file `alpaca_data.json` and upload it to the server with below command, this file can be downloaded in [here](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/blob/main/alpaca_data.json):

```bash
# upload a training file
curl http://${your_ip}:8005/v1/finetune/upload_training_files -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "files=@./alpaca_data.json"
```

### 2. Create fine-tuning job

After a training file `alpaca_data.json` is uploaded, use the following command to launch a finetuning job using `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` as base model:

```bash
# create a finetuning job
curl http://${your_ip}:8005/v1/fine_tuning/jobs \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "training_file": "alpaca_data.json",
    "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
  }'
```

### 3. Manage fine-tuning job

Below commands show how to list finetuning jobs, retrieve a finetuning job, cancel a finetuning job and list checkpoints of a finetuning job.

```bash
# list finetuning jobs
curl http://${your_ip}:8005/v1/fine_tuning/jobs   -X GET

# retrieve one finetuning job
curl http://localhost:8005/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/retrieve   -X POST   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{
    "fine_tuning_job_id": ${fine_tuning_job_id}}'

# cancel one finetuning job

curl http://localhost:8005/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/cancel   -X POST   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{
    "fine_tuning_job_id": ${fine_tuning_job_id}}'

# list checkpoints of a finetuning job
curl http://${your_ip}:8005/v1/finetune/list_checkpoints -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"fine_tuning_job_id": ${fine_tuning_job_id}}'
```
