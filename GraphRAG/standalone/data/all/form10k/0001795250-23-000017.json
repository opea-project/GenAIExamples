Business\nSphere Entertainment Co., formerly Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. and MSG Entertainment Spinco, Inc., is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive office at Two Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, NY, 10121. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cSphere Entertainment\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d refer collectively to Sphere Entertainment Co., a holding company, and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. We conduct substantially all of our business activities discussed in this Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K through Sphere Entertainment Group, LLC, formerly MSG Entertainment Group, LLC, and MSG Networks Inc., and each of their direct and indirect subsidiaries. \nThe Company was incorporated on November 21, 2019 as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (\u201cMSG Sports\u201d), formerly known as The Madison Square Garden Company. On March 31, 2020, MSG Sports\u2019 board of directors approved the distribution of all the outstanding common stock of the Company to MSG Sports stockholders (the \u201c2020 Entertainment Distribution\u201d) which occurred on April 17, 2020 (the \u201c2020 Entertainment Distribution Date\u201d). \nOn April 20, 2023 (the \u201cMSGE Distribution Date\u201d), the Company distributed approximately 67% of the outstanding common stock of Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. (formerly MSGE Spinco, Inc., and referred to herein as \u201cMSG Entertainment\u201d) to its stockholders (the \u201cMSGE Distribution\u201d), with the Company retaining approximately 33% of the outstanding common stock of MSG Entertainment (in the form of MSG Entertainment Class A common stock) immediately following the MSGE Distribution (the \u201cMSGE Retained Interest\u201d). Following the MSGE Distribution Date, the Company retained the Sphere and MSG Networks businesses and MSG Entertainment now owns the traditional live entertainment business previously owned and operated by the Company through its Entertainment business segment, excluding the Sphere business. In the MSGE Distribution, stockholders of the Company received (a) one share of MSG Entertainment\u2019s Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for every share of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (\u201cClass A Common Stock\u201d), held of record as of the close of business, New York City time, on April 14, 2023 (the \u201cRecord Date\u201d), and (b) one share of MSG Entertainment\u2019s Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for every share of the Company\u2019s Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (\u201cClass B Common Stock\u201d), held of record as of the close of business, New York City time, on the Record Date. Following the sale of a portion of the MSGE Retained Interest and the repayment of the delayed draw term loan (further discussed below) with MSG Entertainment through the use of shares of MSG Entertainment Class A common stock, the Company now holds approximately 17% of the outstanding common stock of MSG Entertainment (in the form of Class A common stock), based on 49,128,231 total shares of  MSG Entertainment common stock outstanding as of August 18, 2023.\nOn May 3, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its 66.9% majority interest in TAO Group Sub-Holdings LLC (\u201cTao Group Hospitality\u201d) to a subsidiary of Mohari Hospitality Limited, a global investment company focused on the luxury lifestyle and hospitality sectors (the \u201cTao Group Hospitality Disposition\u201d). \nThe Company reports on a fiscal year basis ending on June\u00a030th. In this annual report on Form 10-K, the fiscal years ended on June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 are referred to as \u201cFiscal Year 2023,\u201d \u201cFiscal Year 2022\u201d and \u201cFiscal Year 2021\u201d, respectively, and the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024 is referred to as \u201cFiscal Year 2024.\u201d\nOverview\nSphere Entertainment Co. is a premier live entertainment and media company comprised of two reportable segments, Sphere and MSG Networks. Sphere is a next-generation entertainment medium, and MSG Networks operates two regional sports and entertainment networks, as well as a direct-to-consumer and authenticated streaming product.\nSphere\n: This segment reflects Sphere, a next-generation entertainment medium powered by cutting-edge technologies that we believe will enable multi-sensory storytelling at an unparalleled scale. The Company\u2019s first Sphere is expected to open in Las Vegas in September 2023. The venue can accommodate up to 20,000 guests and is expected to host a wide variety of events year-round, including The Sphere Experience\nTM\n, which will feature original immersive productions, as well as concerts and residencies from renowned artists, and marquee sporting and corporate events. Supporting this strategy is Sphere Studios, which is home to a team of creative, production, technology and software experts who provide full in-house creative and production services. The studio campus in Burbank includes a 68,000-square-foot development facility, as well as Big Dome, a 28,000-square-foot, 100-foot high custom dome, with a quarter-sized version of the screen at Sphere in Las Vegas, that serves as a specialized screening, production facility, and lab for content at Sphere.\nMSG Networks:\n This segment is comprised of the Company\u2019s regional sports and entertainment networks, MSG Network and MSG Sportsnet, as well as its direct-to-consumer streaming product, MSG+. MSG Networks serves the New York Designated Market Area, as well as other portions of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania and features a wide range of sports content, including exclusive live local games and other programming of the New York Knicks (the \u201cKnicks\u201d) of the National Basketball Association (the \u201cNBA\u201d) and the New York Rangers (the \u201cRangers\u201d), New York Islanders (the \u201cIslanders\u201d), New Jersey Devils (the \n1\n\u201cDevils\u201d) and Buffalo Sabres (the \u201cSabres\u201d) of the National Hockey League (the \u201cNHL\u201d), as well as significant coverage of the New York Giants (the \u201cGiants\u201d) and the Buffalo Bills (the \u201cBills\u201d) of the National Football League (the \u201cNFL\u201d).\nOur Strengths\n\u2022\nStrong position in live entertainment and media through:\n\u25e6\nA next-generation entertainment medium powered by cutting-edge technologies; and\n\u25e6\nTwo award-winning regional sports and entertainment networks\n\u2022\nPresence in both Las Vegas, a market which attracts more than 40 million visitors each year and has over 2 million local residents, and the New York Designated Market Area \u2013 the nation\u2019s largest media market\n\u2022\nDeep industry relationships across music, entertainment, corporate, and sports that can be leveraged to drive events to Sphere \n\u2022\nFocus on world-class guest experience, backed by decades of experience in venue management\n\u2022\nIn-house studio and production expertise for original content creation for Sphere\n\u2022\nEstablished history of successfully planning and executing comprehensive venue design and construction projects\n\u2022\nPortfolio of patents and other intellectual property spanning across Sphere design and construction, audio delivery, cinematic video display systems, and in-venue technologies\n\u2022\nExclusive local media rights to live games of five professional New York-area NBA and NHL teams, including long-term agreements with the Knicks and Rangers; and\n\u2022\nA strong and seasoned management team.\nOur Strategy\nOur strategy is to leverage our Company\u2019s unique assets and brands \u2013 which includes a next-generation entertainment medium, Sphere, and regional sports and entertainment networks \u2013 to create world-class experiences for all key stakeholders, including performers, athletes, content creators, guests, viewers, advertisers and marketing partners. Coupled with our continued commitment to innovation, we believe the Company is positioned to generate long-term value for our stockholders.\nKey components of our strategy include:\nCreating a New Entertainment Medium:\n We believe Sphere will redefine the future of entertainment, combining next generation technologies with multi-sensory storytelling to deliver immersive experiences at an unparalleled scale.  Sphere represents an innovative business model for entertainment venues, with new and expanded revenue opportunities that span across original immersive productions, performances, concerts and residencies, sporting and corporate events, advertising and sponsorship, and premium hospitality, as well as food, beverage and merchandise.\nThe Company\u2019s first Sphere is expected to open in September 2023, and is conveniently located in Las Vegas, one block from the Las Vegas Strip and connected to The Venetian Expo. \nSphere in Las Vegas has already become a landmark \u2013 as the world\u2019s largest spherical structure standing at 366 feet tall and 516 feet wide, with a fully-programmable LED exterior that offers a powerful global platform for potential advertisers and marketing partners, as well as creative content. A grand entrance atrium with immersive experiences, activations, and galleries will welcome guests into the venue, while visitors will also enjoy luxury seating, premier concession spaces, and a full complement of premium hospitality offerings, including 23 suites.  \nOnce inside Sphere\u2019s main venue bowl, guests will experience the full range of the venue\u2019s cutting-edge technologies, including: \n\u2022\nA 16K x 16K LED screen \u2013 a 160,000-square foot high-resolution interior display plane that surrounds the audience, creating a fully immersive visual environment.\n\u2022\nSphere Immersive Sound, powered by HOLOPLOT \u2013 an advanced audio system that delivers crystal-clear, concert-grade sound to every seat in Sphere through beamforming and wave field synthesis technology.\n\u2022\n4D multi-sensory technologies \u2013 which enable guests to feel experiences such as vibrations, wind, scent and changing temperatures to enhance storytelling.\n2\nLeveraging Sphere\u2019s Unique Capabilities to Drive Venue Utilization: \nSphere in Las Vegas was designed and engineered from the ground up to be one of the most highly utilized venues of its size. The venue\u2019s technologies and design will enable it to seamlessly accommodate a variety of different event types, with fast turnover between events, and accommodate multiple events per-day, year-round. This creates the opportunity for Sphere to be more efficiently utilized than traditional large-scale venues.\nDeveloping Original Content:\n During Fiscal Year 2023, we launched Sphere Studios, which is dedicated to the development of immersive entertainment exclusively for Sphere.  Sphere Studios features technology and proprietary tools developed specifically for Sphere that make content creation for this platform a seamless experience. Sphere Studios is also home to an interdisciplinary team of creative, production, technology and software experts who provide full in-house creative and production services, including strategy and concept, capture, post-production and show production. The Company is collaborating with third-party creators and is also developing its own content ranging from original immersive productions, purpose-built for Sphere, to the establishment of a dynamic library of content that can be used by artists or third parties who want to bring their experiences to life \u2013 whether for concerts, residencies or corporate events. \nOriginal content that the Company owns is a key aspect of our business model as it allows for the Company\u2019s economic participation as both venue operator and content owner. It also allows the Company to better control event scheduling and reduces the reliance on third-party events.  In addition, the Company plans to expand its network of Sphere venues around the world over time, which would create additional monetization opportunities for the Company\u2019s original content.  \n\u2022\nDebut of The Sphere Experience.\n A core content category at Sphere in Las Vegas will be The Sphere Experience, which the Company believes will appeal to the over 40 million visitors to Las Vegas annually and over 2 million local residents and can run multiple times a day, year-round.  The Company expects The Sphere Experience to be approximately two hours long and begin when guests enter the venue\u2019s atrium, where they will engage with the latest in technological advancements through a variety of immersive experiences and activations.\n\u2022\nThe experience will continue to the main venue bowl where \u2013 on October 6, 2023 \u2013 the Company plans to debut the original immersive production, \nPostcard From Earth\n, directed by Academy Award nominee, Darren Aronofsky. The production, which will offer a unique perspective on the beauty of life on earth, will utilize the full breadth of the venue\u2019s immersive technologies. \nVenue of Choice for Third-Party Events. \nSphere in Las Vegas is expected to host a wide variety of events, including concerts and residencies from renowned artists, marquee sporting events including mixed-martial arts, boxing and eSports, as well as corporate and special events.  On September 29, 2023, global rock band U2 is expected to open the venue with the first of its 25-show run.  In addition, the Company has entered into a multi-year agreement with Formula 1 for a full multi-day takeover of Sphere, starting with its inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix in November 2023.  The Company plans to leverage Sphere\u2019s unique platform, as well as the Company\u2019s deep relationships across music, entertainment, corporate and sports, to attract additional events to Sphere in Las Vegas. \nUnique Platform for Advertising and Sponsorship\n: Sphere\u2019s unique platform and technological capabilities offer powerful and premium opportunities for advertisers and marketing partners to engage with audiences. The Company expects that Sphere in Las Vegas will deliver significant exposure to the guests that attend events at the venue, including  the more than 40 million annual visitors and over 2 million local residents to Las Vegas, but also around the world on social media. Sphere will offer bespoke advertising and sponsorship opportunities, including externally with the Exosphere and internally with immersive galleries, interactive installations, the atrium, and premium hospitality spaces. Sphere in Las Vegas will offer advertising and marketing partners unique and valuable inventory that is not available in traditional large-scale entertainment venues.\n\u25aa\nThe Exosphere \u2013 \nThe exterior of Sphere in Las Vegas, which we call the Exosphere, is the world\u2019s largest LED screen covered in 580,000 square feet of fully programmable LED paneling, consisting of approximately 1.2 million LED pucks, spaced eight inches apart. Each puck contains 48 individual LED diodes, with each diode capable of displaying 256 million different colors. We believe we have created the world\u2019s largest LED screen and an impactful digital canvas for brands, events, and advertising and marketing partners to showcase content to audiences around the world.\n\u25aa\nOn July 4th, 2023, the Company illuminated the entire exterior of Sphere in Las Vegas for the first time, with a captivating display of dynamic, animated content, which received media coverage across the world and was widely shared on social media. This was followed by additional creative activations including in coordination with the NBA\u2019s Summer League in Las Vegas, as well as the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix. Later in 2023, we expect the Exosphere to be prominently featured as part of Sphere\u2019s opening in September with U2, as well as in coordination with the October debut of \nPostcard From Earth\n.  In November, during the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix, Sphere is expected to have a prime position along the race circuit to showcase the Exosphere to a global audience \u2013 in-person and on TV \u2013 as well as significant exposure through planned takeovers of the Exosphere for race-related content, activations and advertising. \nPursuing a Global Network and Brand.  \nWe believe there are other markets \u2014 both domestic and international \u2014 where Sphere can be successful.  The design of Sphere can accommodate a wide range of sizes and capacities based on the needs of the individual market.  Leveraging the Sphere brand and operating a network of Sphere venues would allow the Company to pursue a number of \n3\navenues for potential growth, including driving increased bookings and greater advertising and sponsorship opportunities. Furthermore, the Company would have the opportunity to leverage its in-house expertise \u2013 including across venue management, design and construction, operations and technology \u2013 to drive new revenue streams.  An increasing number of Sphere venues would also create additional monetization opportunities for the Company\u2019s original content, including \nPostcard From Earth.  \nAs we explore selectively extending Sphere\u2019s network beyond Las Vegas to other markets around the world, we intend to utilize several options such as joint ventures, equity partners, a managed venue model, and non-recourse debt financing. \nA Continued Commitment to Innovation in Media. \nFor more than 50 years, MSG Networks has been at the forefront of the industry, pushing the boundaries of regional sports coverage. We continually seek to enhance the value that our networks provide to viewers, advertisers, and distributors by utilizing state-of-the-art technology to deliver high-quality, best-in-class content and live viewing experiences. In June 2023, MSG Networks introduced MSG+, a direct to consumer streaming product (replacing MSG GO), which allows subscribers to access MSG Network and MSG Sportsnet as well as on demand content on smartphones, tablets, computers and other devices.  MSG+ is available on a free, authenticated basis to subscribers of participating Distributors (including all of MSG Networks\u2019 major Distributors), as well as for purchase on a direct-to-consumer (\u201cDTC\u201d) basis.  In addition to monthly and annual DTC subscription options, in an innovative offering not currently available from any other regional sports network, MSG+ will also offer single game purchases of MSG Networks\u2019 NBA and NHL teams.\nOur Business\nSphere\nThe Company is progressing with its creation of the first Sphere venue, adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip, which will utilize cutting-edge technologies to create immersive experiences on an unparalleled scale. Sphere is an entirely new medium, uniquely built for immersive entertainment experiences. Key design features include:\n\u2022\nA 580,000 square foot, fully-programmable LED Exosphere \u2013 the world\u2019s largest LED screen, which consists of approximately 1.2 million LED pucks, spaced eight inches apart. Each puck contains 48 individual LED diodes, with each diode capable of displaying 256 million different colors.\n\u2022\nThe main venue bowl featuring a 16K x 16K LED screen \u2013 a 160,000-square foot high-resolution interior display plane that surrounds the audience, creating a fully immersive visual environment. \n\u2022\nSphere Immersive Sound, powered by HOLOPLOT \u2013 an advanced audio system that delivers crystal-clear, concert-grade sound to every seat in Sphere through beamforming and wave field synthesis technology.\n\u2022\n4D multi-sensory technologies \u2013 which enable guests to feel experiences such as vibrations, wind, scent and changing temperatures to enhance storytelling.\nThese technologies will come together to create a powerful platform, which we believe will make Sphere the venue of choice for a wide variety of content \u2013 including original immersive productions from leading Hollywood directors; concerts and residencies from the world\u2019s biggest artists; marquee sporting and corporate events.\nThe Company is building its first Sphere in Las Vegas, a 17,600-seat venue with capacity to hold up to 20,000 guests, on land adjacent to The Venetian Resort leased from a subsidiary of Venetian Las Vegas Gaming, LLC (\u201cThe Venetian\u201d). The Venetian agreed to provide us with $75 million to help fund the construction costs, including the cost of a pedestrian bridge that links Sphere to The Venetian Expo. Through June 30, 2023, The Venetian paid us $65 million of this amount for construction costs. The ground lease has no fixed rent; however, if certain return objectives are achieved, The Venetian will receive 25% of the after-tax cash flow in excess of such objectives. The lease is for a term of 50 years, and the Company expects to open the venue on September 29, 2023. \nBecause of the transformative nature of Sphere, we believe there could be other markets \u2014 both domestic and international \u2013 where Sphere can be successful. The design of Sphere will be flexible to accommodate a wide range of sizes and capacities \u2013 from large-scale to smaller and more intimate \u2013 based on the needs of any individual market.\nAs we explore selectively extending the Sphere network beyond Las Vegas to other markets around the world, the Company\u2019s intention is to utilize several options, such as joint ventures, equity partners, a managed venue model, and non-recourse debt financing.\nIn February 2018, we announced the purchase of land in Stratford, London. The Company submitted a planning application for a Sphere venue to the local planning authority in March 2019 and that process, which requires various stages of review to be completed and approvals to be granted, is ongoing. Therefore, we do not have a definitive timeline at this time. \nSee \u201cPart II \u2014 Item\u00a07.\n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Liquidity and Capital Resources\n \n \u2014 Sphere.\u201d\nOur Events\n4\nThe Sphere Experience\n:  A core content category at Sphere in Las Vegas will be The Sphere Experience, which the Company believes will appeal to the over 40 million visitors to Las Vegas annually and the over 2 million local residents and can run multiple times a day, year-round. The Company expects The Sphere Experience to be approximately two hours long and begin when guests enter the venue\u2019s atrium, where they will engage with the latest in technological advancements through a variety of immersive experiences and activations.\nThe experience will continue to the main venue bowl where the Company will feature original immersive productions that utilize the full breadth of the venue\u2019s immersive technologies.  On October 6, 2023, the Company plans to debut the original immersive production, \nPostcard from Earth\n, directed by Academy Award nominee, Darren Aronofsky.\nLive Entertainment\n: Our Company has deep industry relationships that are expected to drive the world\u2019s biggest artists to Sphere in Las Vegas. Global rock band U2 will open Sphere in Las Vegas on September 29, 2023 with the first of 25 shows from the band.\nMarquee Sporting and Corporate Events\n: Our Company plans to host a broad array of live sporting events, including professional boxing, mixed martial arts, eSports, and wrestling, as well as corporate events. In November 2023, during the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix, Sphere will have a prime position along the race circuit to showcase the venue to a global audience \u2013 in-person and on TV \u2013 as well as significant exposure through planned takeovers of the Exosphere for race-related content, activations and advertising.\nOur Advertising, Sponsorship, and Premium Hospitality Partner Offerings\nSphere\u2019s unique platform and technological capabilities offer powerful and premium opportunities for advertisers and marketing partners to engage with audiences.  The Company expects that Sphere in Las Vegas will deliver significant exposure not only to the guests that attend events at the venue and the more than 40 million annual visitors to Las Vegas, and the over 2 million local residents, but also around the world on social media. Sphere will offer bespoke advertising and sponsorship opportunities, including externally with the Exosphere and internally with immersive galleries, interactive installations, the atrium, and suites. Sphere in Las Vegas will offer advertising and marketing partners unique and valuable inventory that is not available in traditional large-scale entertainment venues. \nSphere will also offer premium hospitality products. This includes 23 suites, as well as other hospitality spaces. We expect to license a number of these suites, while also offering suites for single-event use.\nMSG Networks\nMSG Networks is an industry leader in sports production, content development and distribution. It includes two award-winning regional sports and entertainment networks, MSG Network and MSG Sportsnet, and as well as its direct-to-consumer and authenticated streaming product, MSG+. \nDebuting as the first regional sports network in the country on October 15, 1969, MSG Networks has been a pioneer in regional sports programming for more than 50 years, setting a standard of excellence, creativity and technological innovation. Today, MSG Networks\u2019 exclusive, award-winning programming continues to be a valuable differentiator for viewers, advertisers and the cable, satellite, fiber-optic and other platforms (\u201cDistributors\u201d) that distribute its networks. MSG Networks and MSG Sportsnet are widely distributed throughout all of New York State and significant portions of New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as parts of Pennsylvania. MSGN and MSG SportsNet are widely carried by major Distributors in our region, with an average combined reach of approximately 4.1 million viewing subscribers (as of the most recent available monthly information) in our Regional Territory. MSG Network and MSG Sportsnet are also carried nationally by certain Distributors on sports tiers or in similar packages.\nIn June 2023, MSG Networks introduced MSG+, a DTC and authenticated streaming product (replacing MSG GO), which allows subscribers to access MSG Network and MSG Sportsnet and on demand content across devices. MSG+ is available on a free, authenticated basis to subscribers of participating Distributors (including all of MSG Networks\u2019 major Distributors), as well as for purchase by viewers on a DTC basis. In addition to monthly and annual DTC subscription options, in an innovative offering not currently available from any other regional sports network, MSG+ will also offer single game purchases of MSG Networks\u2019 NBA and NHL teams.\nThroughout its history, MSG Networks has been at the forefront of the industry, pushing the boundaries of regional sports coverage. In the process, its networks have become a powerful platform for some of the world\u2019s greatest athletes and entertainers. MSG Networks\u2019 commitment to programming excellence has earned it a reputation for best-in-class programming, production, marketing, and technical innovation. It has won more New York Emmy Awards for live sports and original programming over the past 10 years than any other regional sports network in the region.\nThe foundation of MSG Networks\u2019 programming is its professional sports coverage. MSG Network and MSG Sportsnet feature a wide range of compelling sports content, including exclusive live local games and other programming of the Knicks, Rangers, Islanders, Devils and Sabres, as well as significant coverage of the New York Giants and Buffalo Bills. MSG Networks also showcases a wide array of other sports and entertainment programming, which includes Westchester Knicks basketball, New York Riptide lacrosse, NY/\n5\nNJ Gotham FC of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, NCAA basketball, soccer, baseball, softball and other college sporting events, as well as horse racing, soccer, poker, tennis, pickleball, mixed martial arts and boxing programs.\nMSG Network and MSG Sportsnet collectively air hundreds of live professional games each year, along with a comprehensive lineup of other sporting events and original programming designed to give fans behind-the-scenes access and insight into the teams and players they love. This content includes pre- and post-game coverage throughout the seasons, along with team-related programming that features coaches and players, all of which capitalizes on the enthusiasm for the teams featured on MSG Network and MSG Sportsnet. \nMSG Networks is also positioned as one of the premium destinations for sports gaming content. In Fiscal Year 2023, MSG Networks produced daily, original sports betting shows and multiple betting themed simulcasts for both NBA and NHL games that were each sponsored by one of the Company\u2019s sports gaming partners. The original shows and segments featured a mix of sports gaming experts and former New York athletes covering betting-related topics across the sports world, from NBA and NHL to NFL, MLB, tennis, golf, and mixed martial arts. \nIntellectual Property\nWe create, own and license intellectual property in the countries in which we operate, have operated or intend to operate, and it is our practice to protect our trademarks, brands, copyrights, inventions and other original and acquired works. We have registered many of our trademarks and have filed applications for certain others in the countries in which we operate or intend to operate.

(\u201cSACO\u201d), a global provider of high-performance LED video lighting and media solutions. The Company is utilizing SACO as a preferred display technology provider for Sphere and is benefiting from agreed-upon commercial terms. In addition, the Company also has other investments in various entertainment and related technology companies, accounted for under the equity method. \nIn Fiscal Year 2018, the Company acquired a 25% interest in Holoplot GmbH (\u201cHoloplot\u201d), a global leader in 3D audio technology based in Berlin, Germany. The Company has partnered with Holoplot to create the world's largest, fully integrated concert-grade audio system that we believe will revolutionize immersive audio experiences for Sphere in Las Vegas. In January 2023, the Company, through an indirect subsidiary, extended financing to Holoplot in the form of a three-year convertible loan of \u20ac18.8 million, equivalent to $20.5 million using the applicable exchange rate at the time of the transaction.\nOn April 20, 2023, the Company distributed approximately 67% of the outstanding common stock of MSG Entertainment to its stockholders, with the Company retaining approximately 33% of the outstanding common stock of MSG Entertainment (in the form of Class A common stock) immediately following the MSGE Distribution. Following the sale of a portion of the MSGE Retained Interest on June 27, 2023 and our repayment of the delayed draw term loan (further discussed below) with MSG Entertainment through the use of shares of MSG Entertainment Class A common stock, we now hold approximately 17% of the outstanding common stock of MSG Entertainment (in the form of MSG Entertainment Class A common stock), based on 49,128,231 total shares of MSG Entertainment common stock outstanding as of August 18, 2023.\nSee Note 7. Investments in Nonconsolidated Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nOur Community\nSphere Entertainment is committed to supporting the communities we serve through a variety of important initiatives.  \nAs we approach the opening of Sphere in Las Vegas in September 2023, Sphere has already begun supporting the greater Las Vegas community. This includes engaging with various non-profits that serve diverse populations in Clark County, such as donating more \n6\nthan 5,000 back-to-school supplies to support the Boys & Girls Club of Southern Nevada \u2013 which is also a partner organization of the Garden of Dreams Foundation (\u201cGDF\u201d), a non-profit charity that works with the Company and is dedicated to bringing life-changing opportunities to young people in need. \nWe are likewise engaged in the London community, where we have announced plans to build another Sphere venue, pending necessary approvals. In East London we have focused on providing opportunities for local students to learn about careers in the entertainment industry, such as partnering with the University of East London to mentor students as part of our Student Associate internship program. We\u2019ve also partnered with local institutions such as Theatre Royal Stratford East to host performance opportunities and talent development for up-and-coming local artists.\nMSG Networks also works closely with the Garden of Dreams Foundation on various initiatives, particularly through MSG Classroom. Founded in 2007, MSG Classroom is an Emmy award winning educational initiative that teaches high school students about the media industry through hands-on learning opportunities in areas such as broadcasting, script writing and production, working directly with employees of MSG Networks.   \nThe Company\u2019s 2022 Corporate Social Responsibility Report can be found on our website under \u201cOur Community.\u201d\nGarden of Dreams Foundation\nThe centerpiece of the Company\u2019s philanthropy is GDF. Since it was established in 2006, GDF has donated nearly $75 million in grants and other donations, impacting more than 425,000 young people and their families. GDF focuses on young people facing illness or financial challenges, as well as children of uniformed personnel who have been lost or injured while serving our communities.  In partnership with the Company, MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports, GDF provides young people in our communities with access to educational and skills opportunities; mentoring programs and memorable experiences that enhance their lives, help shape their futures and create lasting joy. Each year, as part of its Season of Giving, GDF partners with MSG Sports\u2019 New York Knicks and New York Rangers, and MSG Entertainment\u2019s Radio City Rockettes on a wide range of charitable programs. GDF further supports its mission by providing a core group of non-profit partners with critical funding to contribute to their long-term success.\nRegulation \nThe rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our business are subject to change. The following paragraphs describe the existing legal and regulatory requirements that are most significant to our business today; they do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our business.\nOur Sphere business is subject to the general powers of federal, state and local government, as well as foreign governmental authorities, to deal with matters of health, public safety and operations.\nVenue Licenses\nSphere, like all public spaces, is subject to building and health codes and fire regulations imposed by state and local government, as well as zoning and outdoor advertising and signage regulations. Sphere requires a number of licenses to operate, including, but not limited to, occupancy permits, exhibition licenses, food and beverage permits, liquor licenses, signage entitlements and other authorizations. We are also subject to statutes that generally provide that serving alcohol to a visibly intoxicated or minor guest is a violation of the law and may provide for strict liability for certain damages arising out of such violations. In addition, we are subject to the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (and related state and local statutes), which requires us to maintain certain accessibility features at our facilities. We are also subject to environmental laws and regulations. See \u201c Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors \u2014 Operational and Economic Risks \u2014 \nWe Are Subject to Extensive Governmental Regulation and Changes in These Regulations and Our Failure to Comply with Them May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\n\u201d\nLabor\nOur  business is also subject to regulation regarding working conditions, overtime and minimum wage requirements. See \u201cItem\u00a01A. Risk Factors \u2014 Operational and Economic Risks \u2014 \nLabor Matters May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\n\u201d\nTicket Sales\nOur Sphere  business is subject to legislation governing the sale and resale of tickets and consumer protection statutes generally.\nData and Privacy\nWe are subject to data privacy and protection laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage, processing and use of personal information or personal data, which among other things, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy and security of personal information. The variety of laws and regulations governing data privacy \n7\nand protection, and the use of the internet as a commercial medium are rapidly evolving, extensive and complex, and may include provisions and obligations that are inconsistent with one another or uncertain in their scope or application. \nThe data protection landscape is rapidly evolving in the United States. For example, California passed a comprehensive data privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), and other states including Virginia,  Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have also passed similar laws, and various additional states may do so in the near future. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCPRA\u201d) imposes additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights procedures and obligations, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and constraints on certain uses of sensitive data. The majority of the CPRA provisions went into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. Further, there are several legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new privacy and security obligations. \nIn addition, governmental authorities and private litigants continue to bring actions against companies for online collection, use, dissemination and security practices that are unfair or deceptive. \nInternational Operations\nOur international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries in which they operate, as well as international bodies, such as the European Union. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to, among other things, foreign privacy and data protection, such as the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, currency and repatriation of funds, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. These laws and regulations apply to the activities of the Company and, in some cases, to individual directors, officers and employees of the Company and agents acting on our behalf. Certain of these laws impose stringent requirements on how we can conduct our foreign operations and could place restrictions on our business and partnering activities.\nFCC Regulations\nOur \nMSG Networks\n business is also subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d). The FCC imposes regulations directly on programming networks and also on certain Distributors in a manner that affects programming networks indirectly. \nClosed Captioning\nOur programming networks must provide closed captioning of video programming for the hearing impaired and meet certain captioning quality standards. The FCC and certain of our affiliation agreements require us to certify compliance with such standards. We are also required to provide closed captioning on certain video content delivered via the Internet, and ensure that our website and applications offering video content comply with certain captioning functionality and other requirements.\nCommercial Loudness\nFCC rules require multichannel video programming distributors (\u201cMVPDs\u201d) to ensure that all commercials comply with specified volume standards, and certain of our affiliation agreements require us to certify compliance with such standards.\nAdvertising Restrictions on Children\u2019s Programming\nAny programming intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under and associated Internet websites that we may offer must comply with certain limits on commercial matter and certain of our affiliation agreements require us to certify compliance with such standards.\nObscenity Restrictions\nDistributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene programming, and certain of our affiliation agreements require us to refrain from including such programming on our networks.\nProgram Carriage\nThe FCC has made changes to the program carriage rules, which prohibit Distributors from favoring their affiliated programming networks over unaffiliated similarly situated programming networks in the rates, terms and conditions of carriage agreements between programming networks and cable operators or other MVPDs. Some of these recent changes to the rules could make it more difficult for our programming networks to challenge a Distributor\u2019s decision to decline to carry one of our programming networks or to discriminate against one of our programming networks.\n8\nPackaging and Pricing\nThe FCC periodically considers examining whether to adopt rules regulating how programmers package and price their networks, such as whether programming networks require Distributors to purchase and carry undesired programming in return for the right to carry desired programming and, if so, whether such arrangements should be prohibited.\nEffect of \u201cMust-Carry\u201d and Retransmission Consent Requirements\nThe FCC\u2019s implementation of the statutory \u201cmust-carry\u201d obligations requires cable and satellite Distributors to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space, and the implementation of \u201cretransmission consent\u201d requirements allow broadcasters to extract compensation, whether monetary or mandated carriage of affiliated content, in return for permission to carry their networks. These rules may reduce the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our programming networks and the amount of funds that Distributors have to pay us for our networks.\nWebsite and Mobile Application Requirements\nOur Sphere and \nMSG Networks\n businesses are also subject to certain regulations applicable to our Internet websites and mobile applications. We maintain various websites and mobile applications that provide information and content regarding our business, offer merchandise and tickets for sale, offer live and on-demand streaming content, make available sweepstakes and/or contests and offer hospitality services. The operation of these websites and applications may be subject to third-party application store requirements, as well as a range of federal, state and local laws including those related to privacy and protection of personal information, accessibility for persons with disabilities and consumer protection regulations. In addition, to the extent any of our websites seek to collect information from children under 13 years of age, they may be subject to the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, which places restrictions on websites\u2019 and online services\u2019 collection and use of personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without parental consent. \n \nCompetition\nCompetition in Our Sphere Business\nOur Sphere business competes, in certain respects and to varying degrees, for guests, advertisers and marketing partners with other leisure-time activities such as television, radio, motion pictures, sporting events and other live performances, entertainment and nightlife venues, the Internet, social media and social networking platforms, online and mobile services, and the large number of other entertainment and public attraction options available to members of the public, advertisers and marketing partners. While Sphere will offer first-of-its-kind immersive opportunities, our Sphere business typically represents a competing use for the public\u2019s entertainment dollars, as well as corporate advertising and sponsorship dollars. The primary geographic area in which we operate, Las Vegas, is a highly competitive entertainment destination, with numerous showrooms, stadiums and arenas, performance residencies, museums, galleries and other attractions available to the public. We compete with these other entertainment and advertising options on the basis of the quality and pricing of our offerings and the public\u2019s interest in our content and advertising and marketing partnership offerings.\nWe compete for bookings with a large number of other venues, both in Las Vegas where Sphere is located and in alternative locations capable of booking traditional productions and events,\n \nwhich venues may be more familiar to performers who may not be willing to take advantage of the immersive experiences and next generation technologies that Sphere offers (which cannot be re-used in other venues). Generally, we compete for bookings on the basis of the size, quality, expense and nature of the venue required for the booking. Some of our competitors may have a larger network of venues and/or greater financial resources. See \u201cItem\u00a01A. Risk Factors \u2014 Operational and Economic Risks \u2014 \nOur Businesses Face Intense and Wide-Ranging Competition That May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nCompetition in Our \nMSG Networks\n Business\nDistribution of Programming Networks\nThe business of distributing programming networks is highly competitive. Our programming networks face competition from other programming networks, including other regional sports and entertainment networks, for the right to be carried by a particular Distributor, and for the right to be carried on the service tier(s) that will attract the most subscribers. Once a programming network of ours is carried by a Distributor, that network competes for viewers not only with the other programming networks available through the Distributor, but also with pay-per-view programming and video on demand offerings, as well as Internet and online streaming and DTC and on demand services, mobile applications, social media and social networking platforms, radio, print media, motion picture theaters, home video, and other sources of information, sporting events and entertainment. Each of the following competitive factors is important to our networks: the prices we charge for our programming networks; the variety, quantity and quality (in particular, the performance of the sports teams whose media rights we control), of the programming offered on our networks; and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\n9\nOur ability to successfully compete with other programming networks for distribution may be hampered because the Distributors may be affiliated with those other programming networks. In addition, because such affiliated Distributors may have a substantial number of subscribers, the ability of such competing programming networks to obtain distribution on affiliated Distributors may lead to increased subscriber and advertising revenue for such networks because of their increased penetration compared to our programming networks. Even if such affiliated Distributors carry our programming networks, there is no assurance that such Distributors will not place their affiliated programming network on more desirable tier(s) or otherwise favor their affiliated programming network, thereby giving the affiliated programming network a competitive advantage over our own.\nNew or existing programming networks that are owned by or affiliated with broadcast networks such as NBC, ABC, CBS or Fox, or broadcast station owners, such as Sinclair, may have a competitive advantage over our networks in obtaining distribution through the \u201cbundling\u201d of agreements to carry those programming networks with the agreement giving the Distributor the right to carry a broadcast station owned by or affiliated with the network.\nIn addition, content providers (such as certain broadcast and cable networks) and new content developers, Distributors and syndicators are distributing programming directly to consumers on a DTC basis. In addition to existing direct-to-consumer streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney+, Max and Peacock, additional services have launched and more will likely launch in the near term, which may include sports-focused services that may compete with our networks for viewers and advertising revenue. Such DTC distribution of content has contributed to consumers eliminating or downgrading their pay television subscription, which results in certain consumers not receiving our programming networks. We recently introduced our own DTC product, which provides consumers an alternative to accessing our programming through our Distributors, but there can be no assurance that we will successfully execute our strategy for such offering.\n \nOur DTC offering represents a new consumer offering for which we have limited prior experience and we may not be able to successfully predict the demand for such product or the impact such  product may have on our traditional distribution business, including with respect to renewals of our affiliation agreements with Distributors. In addition, the success of our DTC product will depend on a number of factors, including competition from other DTC products, such as offerings from other regional sports networks. \nSee \u201cItem\u00a01A. Risk Factors \u2014 Operational and Economic Risks \u2014 \nOur Businesses Face Intense and Wide-Ranging Competition That May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations\n.\u201d and \u201c Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors \u2014 Risks Related to Our \nMSG Networks\n Business \n\u2014 We May Not Be Able to Adapt to New Content Distribution Platforms or to Changes in Consumer Behavior Resulting From Emerging Technologies, Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\u201d \nSources of Programming\nWe also compete with other networks and other distribution outlets to secure desired programming, including sports-related programming. Competition for programming increases as the number of programming networks and distribution outlets, including, but not limited to, streaming outlets, increases. Other programming networks, or distribution outlets, that are affiliated with or otherwise have larger relationships with programming sources such as sports teams or leagues, movie or television studios, or film libraries may have a competitive advantage over us in this area.\nCompetition for Sports Programming Sources\nBecause the loyalty of the sports viewing audience to a sports programming network is primarily driven by loyalty to a particular team or teams, access to adequate sources of sports programming is particularly critical to our networks. In connection with the spinoff of MSG Sports from MSG Networks in September 2015 (the \u201c2015 Sports Distribution\u201d), MSG Networks entered into long-term media rights agreements with the Knicks and Rangers providing MSG Networks with the exclusive live local media rights to their games. MSG Networks also has media rights agreements with the Islanders, Devils and Sabres. Our rights with respect to these professional teams may be limited in certain circumstances due to rules imposed by the leagues in which they compete. Our programming networks compete for telecast rights for teams or events principally with national or regional programming networks that specialize in, or carry, sports programming, local and national commercial broadcast television networks, independent syndicators that acquire and resell such rights nationally, regionally and locally, streaming outlets and other Internet and mobile-based distributors of programming. Some of our competitors may own or control, or are owned or controlled by, or otherwise affiliated with, sports teams, leagues or sports promoters, which gives them an advantage in obtaining telecast rights for such teams or sports. For example, two professional sports teams located in New York have ownership interests in programming networks featuring the games of their teams. Distributors may also contract directly with the sports teams in their local service areas for the right to distribute games on their platforms.\nThe increasing amount of sports programming available on a national basis, including pursuant to national media rights arrangements (e.g., NBA on ABC, ESPN and TNT, and NHL on ABC, ESPN, ESPN+ and TNT), as part of league-controlled sports programming networks (e.g., NBA TV and NHL Network), in out-of-market packages (e.g., NBA League Pass and NHL Center Ice), league and \n10\nother websites, mobile applications and streaming outlets, may have an adverse impact on our competitive position as our programming networks compete for distribution and for viewers. \nCompetition for Advertising Revenue\nThe level of our advertising revenue depends in part upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, such as viewer preferences, the performance of the sports teams whose media rights we control, the quality and appeal of the competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities. See \u201c Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors \u2014 Risks Related to Our \nMSG Networks\n Business \u2014 \nWe Derive Substantial Revenues From the Sale of Advertising and Those Revenues Are Subject to a Number of Factors, Many of Which Are Beyond Our Control.\u201d\nSupplier Diversity\nWe are committed to fostering an inclusive environment across all areas of our business. In partnership with MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports, our business and supplier diversity program seeks to strengthen relationships with diverse suppliers of goods and services and provide opportunities to do business with each of the three companies.  See \u201cHuman Capital Resources \u2014 Diversity and Inclusion.\u201d \nHuman Capital Resources \nWe believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success. Our key human capital management objectives are to invest in and support our employees in order to attract, develop and retain a high performing and diverse workforce.\nDiversity and Inclusion (\u201cD&I\u201d)\nWe aim to create an employee experience that fosters the Company\u2019s culture of respect and inclusion. By welcoming the diverse perspectives and experiences of our employees, we all share in the creation of a more vibrant, unified, and engaging place to work. Together with MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports, we have furthered these objectives under our expanded Talent Management, Diversity and Inclusion function, including:\nWorkforce: Embedding Diversity and Inclusion through Talent Actions \n\u2022\nCreated a common definition of \u201cpotential\u201d and an objective potential assessment to de-bias talent review conversations so employees have an opportunity to learn, grow and thrive. Implemented quarterly performance and career conversations to facilitate regular conversations between managers and employees about goals, career growth and productivity. \n\u2022\nIntegrated D&I best practices into our performance management and learning and development strategies with the goal of driving more equitable outcomes.\n\u2022\nDeveloped an Emerging Talent List to expand our talent pool to better identify and develop high performing diverse talent for expanded roles and promotion opportunities. \nWorkplace: Building an Inclusive and Accessible Community \n\u2022\nRedoubled our efforts with the MSG Diversity & Inclusion Heritage Month enterprise calendar to acknowledge and celebrate culturally relevant days and months of recognition, anchored by our six employee resource groups (\u201cERGs\u201d): Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), Black, LatinX, PRIDE, Veterans, and Women. Increased combined ERG involvement from 622 members in Fiscal Year 2022 to 1,120 members in Fiscal Year 2023 (an increase of 80.1%), which includes employees from the Company, MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports.\n\u2022\nRevamped our Conscious Inclusion Awareness Experience, a training program, and created two required educational modules focused on unconscious bias and conscious inclusion within our learning management system. As of June 30, 2023, over 90% of employees across the Company, MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports have completed both required trainings either through the e-modules or through live training sessions. \n\u2022\nBroadened our LGBTQ+ inclusivity strategy by launching new gender pronoun feature within the employee intranet platform, hosted live allyship and inclusivity trainings, and launched toolkit resources for employees to learn and develop. Together with the PRIDE ERG, marched in the 2022 and 2023 NYC Pride Parades. Hosted a community conversations series focused on \u201cFinding Your Voice as an LGBTQ+ Professional\u201d with a prominent LGBTQ+ elected official and employees of the Company, MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports. \nCommunity: Bridging the Divide through Expansion to Diverse Stakeholders \n11\n\u2022\nFocused on connecting with minority-owned businesses to increase the diversity of our vendors and suppliers by leveraging ERGs and our community, which creates revenue generating opportunities for diverse suppliers to promote their businesses and products. In Fiscal Year 2023, the Company and MSG Sports hosted a multi-city holiday market event featuring twenty underrepresented businesses in New York City and Burbank.\n\u2022\nInvested in an external facing supplier diversity portal on our website, which launched in Fiscal Year 2023. The portal is intended to expand opportunities for the Company, MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports to do business with diverse suppliers, including minority-, women-, LGBTQ+- and veteran-owned businesses. \n\u2022\nStrengthened our commitment to higher education institutions to increase campus recruitment pipelines. In partnership with the Knicks and our social impact team, we and MSG Sports hosted the 2nd Annual Historically Black Colleges and Universities (\u201cHBCU\u201d) Night highlighting the important contributions of these institutions and awarded a $60,000 scholarship to a New York City high school student. \nTalent\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, we had approximately 690 full-time union and non-union employees and approximately 410 part-time union and non-union employees. \nWe aim to attract top talent through our prestigious brands and venues, as well as through the many benefits we offer. We aim to retain and develop our talent by emphasizing our competitive rewards, offering opportunities that support employees both personally and professionally, and our commitment to fostering career development in a positive corporate culture.\nOur performance management practice includes ongoing feedback and conversations between managers and team members, and talent reviews designed to identify potential future leaders and inform succession plans. We value continuous learning and development opportunities for our employees, which include a career development tool, leadership development programs, a learning platform, and tuition assistance.\nOur benefit offerings are designed to meet the range of needs of our diverse workforce and include: domestic partner coverage, an employee assistance program which also provides assistance with child and elder care resources, legal support, pet insurance, wellness programs and financial planning seminars. These resources are intended to support the physical, emotional and financial well-being of our employees.\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, approximately 29% of our employees were represented by unions. Approximately 10% of such union employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements (\u201cCBAs\u201d) that expired as of June\u00a030, 2023 and approximately 67% are subject to CBAs that will expire by June\u00a030, 2024 if they are not extended prior thereto. Labor relations can be volatile, though our current relationships with our unions taken as a whole are positive. We have from time to time faced labor action or had to make contingency plans because of threatened or potential labor actions.\nFinancial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nSubstantially all revenues and assets of the Company\u2019s reportable segments are attributed to or located in the United States. A majority of the Company\u2019s revenues and assets are concentrated in the New York City metropolitan area and Las Vegas.

    "item1a": ">Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors \nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results. For a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, please see below.\nRisks Related to Our Sphere Business\n\u2022\nThe success of our Sphere business depends on the popularity of The Sphere Experience, as well as our ability to attract advertisers and marketing partners, and audiences and artists to concerts, residencies and other events at Sphere in Las Vegas.\n\u2022\nThe Company is completing construction of its first state-of-the-art venue in Las Vegas. Our Sphere business uses cutting-edge technologies and requires significant investments, including for The Sphere Experience (and related original immersive productions) and other offerings. There can be no assurance that Sphere will be successful.\n\u2022\nWe depend on licenses from third parties for the performance of musical works at our venue.\n\u2022\nOur properties are subject to, and benefit from, certain easements, the availability of which may not continue on terms favorable to us or at all. \nRisks Related to Our MSG Networks Business\n\u2022\nThe success of our MSG Networks business depends on affiliation fees we receive under our affiliation agreements, the loss of which or renewal of which on less favorable terms may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nGiven that we depend on a limited number of distributors for a significant portion of our MSG Networks revenues, further industry consolidation could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to adapt to new content distribution platforms or to changes in consumer behavior resulting from emerging technologies, which may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nIf the rate of decline in the number of subscribers to traditional MVPD services continues or these subscribers shift to other services or bundles that do not include the Company\u2019s programming networks, there may be a material negative effect on the Company\u2019s affiliation revenues.\n\u2022\nWe derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising and those revenues are subject to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. \n\u2022\nOur MSG Networks business depends on media rights agreements with professional sports teams that have varying durations and terms and include significant obligations, and our inability to renew those agreements on acceptable terms, or the loss of such rights for other reasons, may have a material negative effect on our MSG Networks business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur MSG Networks business is substantially dependent on the popularity of the NBA and NHL teams whose media rights we control. The actions of the NBA and NHL may have a material negative effect on our MSG Networks business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur MSG Networks business depends on the appeal of its programming, which may be unpredictable, and increased programming costs may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOperational and Economic Risks\n\u2022\nOur businesses face intense and wide-ranging competition that may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur operations and operating results were materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response by governmental authorities and certain professional sports leagues, and a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or another pandemic or public health emergency could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur business has been adversely impacted and may, in the future, be materially adversely impacted by an economic downturn, recession, financial instability, inflation or changes in consumer tastes and preferences.\n\u2022\nThe geographic concentration of our businesses could subject us to greater risk than our competitors and have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur business could be adversely affected by terrorist activity or the threat of terrorist activity, weather and other conditions that discourage congregation at prominent places of public assembly.\n14\n\u2022\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation and changes in these regulations and our failure to comply with them may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nLabor matters may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. \n\u2022\nThe unavailability of systems upon which we rely may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThere is a risk of injuries and accidents in connection with Sphere, which could subject us to personal injury or other claims; we are subject to the risk of adverse outcomes in other types of litigation.\n\u2022\nWe face risks from doing business internationally.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness, Financial Condition, and Internal Control \n\u2022\nWe have substantial indebtedness and are highly leveraged, which could adversely affect our business if our subsidiaries are not able to make payments on, or repay or refinance, such debt under their respective credit facilities (including refinancing the MSG Networks debt prior to its maturity in October 2024), or if we are not able to obtain additional financing, to the extent required. \n\u2022\nWe may require additional financing to fund certain of our obligations, ongoing operations, and capital expenditures, the availability of which is uncertain.\n\u2022\nWe have incurred substantial operating losses, adjusted operating losses and negative cash flow and there is no assurance we will have operating income, adjusted operating income or positive cash flow in the future.\n\u2022\nMaterial weaknesses or adverse findings in our internal control over financial reporting in the future could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. \nRisks Related to Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property\n\u2022\nWe face continually evolving cybersecurity and similar risks, which could result in loss, disclosure, theft, destruction or misappropriation of, or access to, our confidential information and cause disruption of our business, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses.\n\u2022\nWe may become subject to infringement or other claims relating to our content or technology.\n\u2022\nTheft of our intellectual property may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Governance and Our Controlled Ownership \n\u2022\nWe are materially dependent on our affiliated entities\u2019 performances under various agreements.\n\u2022\nThe MSGE Distribution could result in significant tax liability. We may have a significant indemnity obligation to MSG Entertainment if the MSGE Distribution is treated as a taxable transaction.\n\u2022\nWe are controlled by the Dolan family. As a result of their control, the Dolan family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by the Company. \n\u2022\nWe share certain directors, officers and employees with MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and/or AMC Networks, which means those individuals do not devote their full time and attention to our affairs. Additionally, our overlapping directors and officers with MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and/or AMC Networks may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities and other conflicts.\nRisks Related to Our Sphere Business\nThe Success of Our Sphere Business Depends on the Popularity of The Sphere Experience, as Well as Our Ability to Attract Advertisers and Marketing Partners, and Audiences and Artists to Concerts, Residencies and Other Events at Sphere in Las Vegas. If The Sphere Experience Does Not Appeal to Customers or We Are Unable to Attract Advertisers and Marketing Partners, There Will be a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations. \nThe financial results of our Sphere business are largely dependent on the popularity of The Sphere Experience, which will feature original immersive productions that can run multiple times per day, year-round and are designed to utilize the full breadth of the venue\u2019s next-generation technologies. The Sphere Experience will employ novel and transformative technologies for which there is no established basis of comparison, and there is an inherent risk that we may be unable to achieve the level of success appropriate for the significant investment involved. Fan and consumer tastes also change frequently and it is a challenge to anticipate what will be successful at any point in time. Should the popularity of The Sphere Experience not meet our expectations, our revenues from ticket sales, and concession and merchandise sales would be adversely affected, and we might not be able to replace the lost revenue with revenues from other sources. As a result of any of the foregoing, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to cover our costs, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations and the price of our Class A Common Stock.\n15\nInitially, our Sphere business will only have access to one original immersive production, called \nPostcard from Earth\n. The risk of reliance on The Sphere Experience described above is exacerbated by the lack of availability of alternative content if \nPostcard from Earth\n is not successful in attracting gue\nsts. If The Sphere Experience is not successful, we will not have sufficient capital to develop a second original immersive production.\n In that event, Sphere in Las Vegas will need to rely on live entertainment offerings to be successful and to generate enough capital to develop a second original immersive production or partner with third parties.\nAdditionally, our Sphere business is also dependent on our ability to attract advertisers and marketing partners to our signage, digital advertising and partnership offerings. Advertising revenues depend on a number of factors, such as the reach and popularity of our venue (including risks around consumer reactions to advertisers and marketing partners), the health of the economy in the markets our businesses serve and in the nation as a whole, general economic trends in the advertising industry and competition with respect to such offerings. Should the popularity of our advertising assets not meet our expectations, our revenues would be adversely affected, and we might not be able to replace the lost revenue with revenues from other sources, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations and the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nThe success of our Sphere business will also depend upon our ability to offer live entertainment that is popular with guests. While the Company believes that these next-generation venues will enable new experiences and innovative opportunities to engage with audiences, there can be no assurance that guests, artists, promoters, advertisers and marketing partners will embrace this new platform. We contract with promoters and others to provide performers and events at Sphere and Sphere grounds. There may be a limited number of popular artists, groups or events that are willing to take advantage of the immersive experiences and next generation technologies (which cannot be re-used in other venues) or that can attract audiences to Sphere, and our business would suffer to the extent that we are unable to attract such artists, groups and events willing to perform at our venue. \nThe Company Is Completing Construction of its First State-of-the-Art Venue in Las Vegas, While Pursuing a Potential Venue in London. Sphere Uses Cutting-Edge Technologies and Requires Significant Capital Investment by the Company. There Can Be No Assurance That Sphere Will Be Successful.\nThe Company is progressing with its venue strategy to create, build and operate new music and entertainment-focused venues \u2014 called Sphere \u2014 that use cutting-edge technologies to create the next generation of immersive experiences. There is no assurance that the Sphere initiative will be successful. We are completing construction of our first Sphere in Las Vegas. See \u201cItem 1. Our Business \u2014 \u2014 Sphere.\u201d  \nThe costs to build Sphere have been substantial. While it is always difficult to provide a definitive construction cost estimate for large-scale construction projects, it has been particularly challenging for one as unique as Sphere. In May 2019, the Company\u2019s preliminary cost estimate for Sphere in Las Vegas was approximately $1.2 billion. This estimate was based only upon schematic designs for purposes of developing the Company\u2019s budget and financial projections. In February 2020, we announced that our cost estimate, inclusive of core technology and soft costs, for Sphere in Las Vegas was approximately $1.66 billion and subsequently\n increased \nthat\n cost estimate, \nwhich excluded significant capitalized and non-capitalized costs for items such as content creation, internal labor, capitalized interest, and furniture and equipment. \nAs of the date of this filing, we estimate that the final project construction costs for Sphere in Las Vegas will be approximately $2.3 billion. This cost estimate is net of \n$75 million\n that the Venetian has agreed to pay to defray certain construction costs. Relative to our cost estimate above, our actual construction costs for Sphere in Las Vegas paid through \nAugust\u00a018, 2023\n were approximately \n$2.25 billion\n, which is net of $65 million received from The Venetian.\n \nFor more information regarding the costs of Sphere, see \u201cPart II \u2014 Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Liquidity and Capital Resources \u2014 Sphere.\u201d\nIn light of the ambitious and unique design of Sphere, including the use of technologies that have not previously been employed in major entertainment venues, the risk of delays and higher than anticipated costs are elevated. As the Company completes construction of its Las Vegas venue, which is expected to open in September 2023, the Company may still face unexpected project delays and other complications. \nWe may also continue to explore additional domestic and international markets where these next-generation venues are expected to be successful. The design of future Spheres will be flexible to accommodate a wide range of sizes and capacities \u2013 from large-scale to smaller and more intimate \u2013 based on the needs of any individual market. In connection with the construction of future Sphere venues, the Company may need to obtain additional capital beyond what is available from cash-on-hand and cash flows from operations. While the Company has self-funded the construction of Sphere in Las Vegas, the Company\u2019s intention for future venues is to utilize several options, such as joint ventures, equity partners, a managed venue model and non-recourse debt financing. There is no assurance that we would be able to obtain financing for any costs relating to any future venues on terms favorable to us or at all.\nIn February 2018, we announced the purchase of land in Stratford, London, which we expect will become home to a future Sphere. The Company submitted a planning application to the local planning authority in March 2019 and that process, which requires various stages of review to be completed and approvals to be granted, is ongoing. Therefore, we do not have a definitive timeline at this time.\n16\nSphere employs novel and transformative technologies and new applications of existing technologies. As a result, there can be no assurance that Sphere will achieve the technical, operational and artistic goals the Company is seeking. Any failure to do so could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nWhile the Company believes that these next-generation venues will enable new experiences and innovative opportunities to engage with audiences, there can be no assurance that guests, artists, promoters, advertisers and marketing partners will embrace this new platform. The substantial cost of building Sphere in Las Vegas, as well as the costs and/or financing needs with respect to Sphere in London, may constrain the Company\u2019s ability to undertake other initiatives during these multi-year construction periods. Given our strategy of using original immersive productions across multiple venues, our Sphere initiative may not be successful unless we can develop additional venues.\nOur Sphere Business Strategy Includes the Development of The Sphere Experience and Related Original Immersive Productions, Which Could Require Us to Make Considerable Investments for Which There Can Be No Guarantee of Success.\nAs part of our Sphere business strategy, we intend to develop The Sphere Experience and related original immersive productions, which could require significant upfront expense that may never result in a viable production, as well as investment in creative processes, commissioning and/or licensing of intellectual property, casting and advertising and may lead to dislocation of other alternative sources of entertainment that may have played in our venue absent these productions. As of June 30, 2023, we had invested approximately $61 million in developing the first original immersive production called \nPostcard from Earth\n, and there can be no assurances as to the cost of future immersive productions, which we expect to be significant. To the extent that any efforts at creating new immersive productions do not result in a viable offering, or to the extent that any such productions do not achieve expected levels of popularity among audiences, we may not recover the substantial expenses we previously incurred for non-capitalized investments, or may need to write-off all or a portion of capitalized investments. In addition, any delay in launching such productions could result in the incurrence of operating costs which may not be recouped. The incurrence of such expenses or the write-off of capitalized investments could adversely impact our business and results of operations and the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe Depend on Licenses from Third Parties for the Performance of Musical Works at Our Venue, the Loss of Which or Renewal of Which on Less Favorable Terms May Have a Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nWe have obtained and will be required to obtain public performance licenses from music performing rights organizations, commonly known as \u201cPROs,\u201d in connection with the performance of musical works at concerts and certain other live events held at Sphere. In exchange for public performance licenses, PROs are paid a per-event royalty, traditionally calculated either as a percentage of ticket revenue or a per-ticket amount. The PRO royalty obligation of any individual event is generally paid by, or charged to, the promoter of the event.\nIf we are unable to obtain these licenses, or are unable to obtain them on favorable terms consistent with past practice, it may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. An increase in the royalty rate and/or the revenue base on which the royalty rate is applied could substantially increase the cost of presenting concerts and certain other live events at our venue. If we are no longer able to pass all or a portion of these royalties on to promoters (or other venue licensees), it may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Properties Are Subject to, and Benefit from, Certain Easements, the Availability of Which May Not Continue on Terms Favorable to Us or at All.\nSphere in Las Vegas will have the benefit of easements with respect to the planned pedestrian bridge to The Venetian. Our ability to continue to utilize these and other easements, including for advertising and promotional purposes, requires us to comply with a number of conditions. Certain adjoining property owners have easements over our property, which we are required to maintain so long as those property owners meet certain conditions. It is possible that we will be unable to continue to access or maintain any easements on terms favorable to us, or at all, which could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. \nRisks Related to Our \nMSG Networks\n Business\nThe Success of Our MSG Networks Business Depends on Affiliation Fees We Receive Under Our Affiliation Agreements, the Loss of Which or Renewal of Which on Less Favorable Terms May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nMSG Networks\u2019 success is dependent upon affiliation relationships with a limited number of Distributors. Existing affiliation agreements of our programming networks expire during each of the next several years and we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to renew these affiliation agreements or obtain terms as attractive as our existing agreements in the event of a renewal. For example, we were not able to renew our affiliation agreement with Comcast when it expired in September 2021. \n17\nAffiliation fees constitute a significant majority of our MSG Networks revenues. Changes in affiliation fee revenues generally result from a combination of changes in rates and/or changes in subscriber counts. Reductions in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid, including as a result of a loss of or reduction in carriage of our programming networks or a loss of subscribers by one or more of our Distributors, have in the past adversely affected (e.g., the non-renewal with Comcast) and will in the future adversely affect our affiliation fee revenue. For example, our affiliation fee revenue declined $67.3 million in Fiscal Year 2023 compared to Fiscal Year 2022. Subject to the terms of our affiliation agreements, Distributors from time to time introduce, market and/or modify tiers of programming networks that impact the number of subscribers that receive our programming networks, including tiers of programming that may exclude our networks. Any loss or reduction in carriage would also decrease the potential audience for our programming, which may adversely affect our advertising revenues. See \u201c\u2014 \nIf the Rate of Decline in the Number of Subscribers to Traditional MVPDs Services Increases or These Subscribers Shift to Other Services or Bundles That Do Not Include the Company\u2019s Programming Networks, There May Be a Material Negative Effect on the Company\u2019s Affiliation Revenues.\n\u201d\nOur affiliation agreements generally require us to meet certain content criteria, such as minimum thresholds for professional event telecasts throughout the calendar year on our networks. If we do not meet these criteria, remedies may be available to our Distributors, such as fee reductions, rebates or refunds and/or termination of these agreements in some cases. For example, we recorded $10.7 million in Fiscal Year 2022 for affiliate rebates.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, an existing affiliation agreement may expire and we and the Distributor may not have finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time. In certain of these circumstances, Distributors may continue to carry the service(s) until the execution of definitive renewal or replacement agreements (or until we or the Distributor determine that carriage should cease).\nOccasionally, we may have disputes with Distributors over the terms of our affiliation agreements. If not resolved through business discussions, such disputes could result in administrative complaints, litigation and/or actual or threatened termination of an existing agreement. The loss of any of our significant Distributors, the failure to renew on terms as attractive as our existing agreements (or to do so in a timely manner) or disputes with our counterparties relating to the interpretation of their agreements with us, could result in our inability to generate sufficient revenues to perform our obligations under our agreements or otherwise materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nGiven That We Depend on a Limited Number of Distributors for a Significant Portion of Our MSG Networks Revenues, Further Industry Consolidation Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations.\nThe pay television industry is highly concentrated, with a relatively small number of Distributors serving a significant percentage of pay television subscribers that receive our programming networks, thereby affording the largest Distributors significant leverage in their relationship with programming networks, including ours. Substantially all of our affiliation fee revenue comes from our top four Distributors. Further consolidation in the industry could reduce the number of Distributors available to distribute our programming networks and increase the negotiating leverage of certain Distributors, which could adversely affect our revenue. In some cases, if a Distributor is acquired, the affiliation agreement of the acquiring Distributor will govern following the acquisition. In those circumstances, the acquisition of a Distributor that is a party to one or more affiliation agreements with us on terms that are more favorable to us than that of the acquirer could have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations. \nWe May Not Be Able to Adapt to New Content Distribution Platforms or to Changes in Consumer Behavior Resulting From Emerging Technologies, Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nWe must successfully adapt to technological advances in our industry and the manner in which consumers watch sporting events, including the emergence of alternative distribution platforms. Our ability to exploit new distribution platforms and viewing technologies may affect our ability to maintain and/or grow our business. Emerging forms of content distribution provide different economic models and compete with current distribution methods in ways that are not entirely predictable. Such competition has reduced and could continue to reduce demand for our programming networks or for the offerings of our Distributors and, in turn, reduce our revenue from these sources. Content providers (such as certain broadcast and cable networks) and new content developers, Distributors and syndicators are distributing programming directly to consumers on a DTC  basis. In addition to existing subscription direct-to-consumer streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney+, ESPN+, Max and Peacock and free advertiser-supported streaming television (\u201cFAST\u201d) channels that are offered directly to consumers at no cost, additional services have launched and more will likely launch in the near term, which may include sports-focused services that may compete with our networks for viewers and advertising revenue. Such DTC distribution of content has contributed to consumers eliminating or downgrading their pay television subscription, which results in certain consumers not receiving our programming networks. If we are unable to offset this loss of subscribers through incremental distribution of our networks (including through our own direct-to-consumer offering) or through rate increases or other revenue opportunities, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. Gaming, television and other console and device manufacturers, Distributors and others, such as Microsoft, Apple and Roku, are offering and/or developing technology to offer video programming, including in some cases, various DTC platforms. \n18\nSuch changes have impacted and may continue to impact the revenues we are able to generate from our traditional distribution methods, by decreasing the viewership of our programming networks and/or by making advertising on our programming networks less valuable to advertisers.\nIn order to respond to these developments, we have in the past needed, and may in the future need, to implement changes to our business models and strategies and there can be no assurance that any such changes will prove to be successful or that the business models and strategies we develop will be as profitable as our current business models and strategies. For example, we introduced MSG SportsZone, a FAST channel which launched in January 2023. We also recently launched our DTC product, MSG+, but there can be no assurance that we will successfully execute our strategy for such offering. Our DTC offering represents a new consumer offering for which we have limited prior experience and we may not be able to successfully predict the demand for such DTC product or the impact such DTC product may have on our traditional distribution business, including with respect to renewals of our affiliation agreements with Distributors.  In addition, the success of our DTC product may depend on a number of factors, including our ability to: (i) acquire and maintain direct-to-consumer rights from the professional sports teams and/or leagues we currently air on our networks; (ii) appropriately price our offering; (iii) offer competitive content and programming and (iv) ensure our direct-to-consumer technology operates efficiently.  If we fail to adapt to emerging technologies, our appeal to Distributors and our targeted audiences might decline, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIf the Rate of Decline in the Number of Subscribers to Traditional MVPD Services Continues or These Subscribers Shift to Other Services or Bundles That Do Not Include the Company\u2019s Programming Networks, There May Be a Material Negative Effect on the Company\u2019s Affiliation Revenues.\nDuring the last few years, the number of subscribers to traditional MVPD services in the U.S. has been declining. In addition, Distributors have introduced, marketed and/or modified tiers or bundles of programming that have impacted the number of subscribers that receive our programming networks, including tiers or bundles of programming that exclude our programming networks. As a result of these factors, the Company has experienced a decrease in subscribers in each of the last several fiscal years, which has adversely affected our operating results.\nIf traditional MVPD service offerings are not attractive to consumers due to pricing, increased competition from DTC  and other services, dissatisfaction with the quality of traditional MVPD services, poor economic conditions or other factors, more consumers may (i) cancel their traditional MVPD service subscriptions or choose not to subscribe to traditional MVPD services, (ii) elect to instead subscribe to DTC services, which in some cases may be offered at a lower price-point and may not include our programming networks or (iii) elect to subscribe to smaller bundles of programming which may not include our programming networks. If the rate of decline in the number of traditional MVPD service subscribers continues or if subscribers shift to DTC services or smaller bundles of programming that do not include the Company\u2019s programming networks, this may have a material negative effect on the Company\u2019s revenues. \nWe Derive Substantial Revenues From the Sale of Advertising and Those Revenues Are Subject to a Number of Factors, Many of Which Are Beyond Our Control.\nAdvertising revenues depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as: (i) team performance; (ii) whether live sports games are being played; (iii) the popularity of our programming; (iv) the activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based media (such as Internet, mobile media, other programming networks, radio and print media) and an increasing shift of advertising expenditures to digital and mobile offerings; (v) shifts in consumer viewing patterns, including consumers watching more ad-free content, non-traditional and shorter-form video content online, and the increased use of ad skipping functionality; (vi) increasing audience fragmentation caused by increased availability of alternative forms of leisure and entertainment activities, such as social networking platforms and video games; (vii) consumer budgeting and buying patterns; (viii) the extent of the distribution of our networks; (ix) changes in the audience demographic for our programming; (x) the ability of third parties to successfully and accurately measure audiences due to changes in emerging technologies and otherwise; (xi) the health of the economy in the markets our businesses serve and in the nation as a whole; and (xii) general economic trends in the advertising industry. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general has in the past altered, and could in the future alter, current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities, which could cause our revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period. Even in the absence of a general recession or downturn in the economy, an individual business sector that tends to spend more on advertising than other sectors may be forced to reduce its advertising expenditures if that sector experiences a downturn. In such case, a reduction in advertising expenditures by such a sector may adversely affect our revenues. See \u201c\u2014 Operational and Economic Risks \u2014 \nOur Operations and Operating Results Were Materially Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Actions Taken in Response by Governmental Authorities and Certain Professional Sports Leagues, and a Resurgence of the COVID-19 Pandemic or Another Pandemic or Public Health Emergency Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations.\u201d\n19\nThe pricing and volume of advertising has been affected by shifts in spending away from more traditional media toward online and mobile offerings or towards new ways of purchasing advertising, such as through automated purchasing, dynamic advertising insertion, third parties selling local advertising spots and advertising exchanges, some or all of which may not be as advantageous to the Company as current advertising methods.\nIn addition, we cannot ensure that our programming will achieve favorable ratings. Our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as team performance, whether live sports games are being played, viewer preferences, the level of distribution of our programming, competing programming and the availability of other entertainment options. A shift in viewer preferences could cause our advertising revenues to decline as a result of changes to the ratings for our programming and materially negatively affect our business and results of operations. \nOur MSG Networks Business Depends on Media Rights Agreements With Professional Sports Teams that Have Varying Durations and Terms and Include Significant Obligations, and Our Inability to Renew Those Agreements on Acceptable Terms, or the Loss of Such Rights for Other Reasons, May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our MSG Networks Business and Results of Operations.\nOur MSG Networks business is dependent upon media rights agreements with professional sports teams. Our existing media rights agreements are generally long term, except a media rights agreement with one of our NHL teams expires following the end of the 2023-24 NHL season.\n \nUpon expiration, we may seek renewal of these agreements and, if we do, we may be outbid by competing programming networks or others for these agreements or the renewal costs could substantially exceed our costs under the current agreements. In addition, one or more of these teams may seek to establish their own programming offering or join one of our competitor\u2019s offerings and, in certain circumstances, we may not have an opportunity to bid for the media rights.\nEven if we are able to renew such media rights agreements, the Company\u2019s results could be adversely affected if our obligations under our media rights agreements prove to be outsized relative to the revenues our MSG Networks segment is able to generate. Our media rights agreements with professional sports teams have varying terms and include significant obligations, which increase annually, without regard to the number of subscribers to our programming networks or the level of our affiliation and/or advertising revenues.  If we are not able to generate sufficient revenues, including due to a loss of any of our significant Distributors or failure to renew affiliation agreements on terms as attractive as our existing agreements, we may be unable to renew media rights agreements on acceptable terms, or to perform our obligations under our existing media rights agreements, which could lead to a default under those agreements and the potential loss of such media rights, which could materially negatively affect our business and results of operations. \nIn recent years, certain regional sports networks have experienced financial difficulties. For example, Diamond Sports Group, LLC, an unconsolidated subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc., which licenses and distributes sports content in a number of regional markets, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in March 2023.\nMoreover, the value of our media rights agreements may also be affected by various league decisions and/or league agreements that we may not be able to control, including a decision to alter the number of games played during a season. The value of our media rights could also be affected, or we could lose such rights entirely, if a team is liquidated, undergoes reorganization in bankruptcy or relocates to an area where it is not possible or commercially feasible for us to continue to distribute games. Any loss or diminution in the value of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by us and could materially negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, our affiliation agreements generally include certain remedies in the event our networks fail to include a minimum number of professional event telecasts, and, accordingly, any loss of rights could materially negatively affect our business and results of operations. See \u201c\u2014 \nThe Success of Our MSG Networks Business Depends on Affiliation Fees We Receive Under Our Affiliation Agreements, the Loss of Which or Renewal of Which on Less Favorable Terms May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations\n\u201d and \u201c\u2014 \nThe Actions of the NBA and NHL May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our MSG Networks Business and Results of Operations.\n\u201d \nThe Actions of the NBA and NHL May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our MSG Networks Business and Results of Operations.\nThe governing bodies of the NBA and the NHL have imposed, and may impose in the future, various rules, regulations, guidelines, bulletins, directives, policies and agreements (collectively, \u201cLeague Rules\u201d) that we may not be able to control, which could affect the value of our media rights agreements, including a decision to alter the number of games played during a season. For example, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions, decisions made by the NBA and NHL affected, and in the future could affect, our ability to produce and distribute live sports games on our networks. See \u201c\u2014 Operational and Economic Risks \u2014 \nOur Operations and Operating Results Were Materially Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Actions Taken in Response by Governmental Authorities and Certain Professional Sports Leagues, and a Resurgence of the COVID-19 Pandemic or Another Pandemic or Public Health Emergency Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations\n\u201d Additionally, each league imposes rules that define the territories in which we may distribute games of the teams in the applicable league. Changes to these rules or other League Rules, or the adoption of new League Rules, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. \n20\nOur MSG Networks Business is Substantially Dependent on the Popularity of the NBA and NHL Teams Whose Media Rights We Control.\nOur MSG Networks segment has historically been, and we expect will continue to be, dependent on the popularity of the NBA and NHL teams whose local media rights we control and, in varying degrees, those teams achieving on-court and on-ice success, which can generate fan enthusiasm, resulting in increased viewership and advertising revenues. Furthermore, success in the regular season may qualify a team for participation in the post-season, which generates increased excitement and interest in the teams, which can improve viewership and advertising revenues. Some of our teams have not participated in the post-season for extended periods of time, and may not participate in the post-season in the future. For example, the Knicks have qualified for the post-season twice in the past 10 NBA seasons and the Sabres have not qualified for the post-season since the 2010-11 NHL season. In addition, if a team declines in popularity or fails to generate fan enthusiasm, this may negatively impact the terms on which our affiliate agreements are renewed. There can be no assurance that any sports team will generate fan enthusiasm or compete in post-season play and the failure to do so could result in a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur MSG Networks Business Depends on the Appeal of Its Programming, Which May Be Unpredictable, and Increased Programming Costs May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nOur MSG Networks business depends, in part, upon viewer preferences and audience acceptance of the programming on our networks. These factors are often unpredictable and subject to influences that are beyond our control, such as the quality and appeal of competing programming, general economic conditions and the availability of other entertainment options. We may not be able to successfully predict interest in proposed new programming and viewer preferences could cause new programming not to be successful or cause our existing programming to decline in popularity. If our programming does not gain or maintain the level of audience acceptance we, our advertisers, or Distributors expect, it could negatively affect advertising or affiliation fee revenues. \nIn addition, we rely on third parties for sports and other programming for our networks. We compete with other providers of programming to acquire the rights to distribute such programming. If we fail to continue to obtain sports and other programming for our networks on reasonable terms for any reason, including as a result of competition, we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for or develop alternative programming. An increase in our costs associated with programming, including original programming, may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nThe Unavailability of Third Party Facilities, Systems and/or Software Upon Which Our MSG Networks Business Relies May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nDuring Fiscal Year 2023, our MSG Networks business completed a transition of its signal transmission method from satellite delivery to a terrestrial, internet-protocol based transmission method, which uses third-party IP-based fiber transmission systems to transmit our programming services to Distributors. Notwithstanding certain back-up and redundant systems and facilities maintained by our third-party providers, transmissions or quality of transmissions may be disrupted, including as a result of events that may impair such terrestrial transmission facilities.\nIn addition, we are party to an agreement with AMC Networks Inc. (\u201cAMC Networks\u201d), pursuant to which AMC Networks provides us with certain origination, master control and technical services which are necessary to distribute our programming networks. If a disruption occurs, we may not be able to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner. In addition, such distribution facilities and/or internal or third-party services, systems or software could be adversely impacted by cybersecurity threats including unauthorized breaches. See \u201c\u2014 Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property \u2014 \nWe Face Continually Evolving Cybersecurity and Similar Risks, Which Could Result in Loss, Disclosure, Theft, Destruction or Misappropriation of, or Access to, Our Confidential Information and Cause Disruption of Our Business, Damage to Our Brands and Reputation, Legal Exposure and Financial Losses.\n\u201d The failure or unavailability of distribution facilities or these internal and third-party services, systems or software, depending upon its severity and duration, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOperational and Economic Risks\nOur Businesses Face Intense and Wide-Ranging Competition That May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nOur businesses compete, in certain respects and to varying degrees, for guests, advertisers and viewers with other leisure-time activities such as television, radio, motion pictures, sporting events and other live performances, entertainment and nightlife venues, the Internet, social media and social networking platforms, and online and mobile services, including sites for online content distribution, video on demand and other alternative sources of entertainment and information, in addition to competing for concerts, residencies and performances with other event venues (including future venues and arenas) for total entertainment dollars in our marketplace. \n21\nSphere business. \nThe success of our Sphere business is largely dependent on the success of The Sphere Experience, which will feature first-of-its-kind immersive productions that can run multiple times per day, year-round and are designed to utilize the full breadth of the venue\u2019s next-generation technologies. The Sphere Experience will employ novel and transformative technologies for which there is no established basis of comparison, and there is an inherent risk that we may be unable to achieve the level of success we are expecting, which could have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations. Additionally, our Sphere business is also dependent on our ability to attract advertisers and marketing partners and we compete with other venues and companies for signage and digital advertising dollars. The degree and extent of competition for advertising dollars will depend on our pricing, reach and audience demographics, among others. Should the popularity of The Sphere Experience or our advertising assets not meet our expectations, our revenues from ticket sales, concession and merchandise sales and advertising would be adversely affected, and we might not be able to replace the lost revenue with revenues from other sources. As a result of any of the foregoing, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to cover our costs, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations and the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIn addition, we expect our Sphere business will be highly sensitive to customer tastes and will depend on our ability to attract concerts, residencies, marquee sporting events, corporate and other events to our venue, competition for which is intense, and in turn, the ability of performers to attract strong attendance. For example, Sphere will compete with other entertainment options in the Las Vegas area, which is a popular entertainment destination. \nWhile the Company believes that these next-generation venues will enable new experiences and innovative opportunities to engage with audiences, there can be no assurance that guests, artists, promoters, advertisers and marketing partners will embrace this new platform. We contract with promoters and others to provide performers and events at Sphere and Sphere grounds. There may be a limited number of popular artists, groups or events that are willing to take advantage of the immersive experiences and next generation technologies (which cannot be re-used in other venues) or that can attract audiences to Sphere, and our business would suffer to the extent that we are unable to attract such artists, groups and events willing to perform at our venue\n. \nIn addition, we must maintain a competitive pricing structure for events that may be held at Sphere, many of which may have alternative venue options available to them in Las Vegas and other cities. We have and may continue to invest a substantial amount in The Sphere Experience to continue to attract audiences. We cannot assure you that such investments will generate revenues that are sufficient to justify our investment or even that exceed our expenses. \nMSG Networks business\n. Our MSG Networks business competes, in certain respects and to varying degrees, for viewers and advertisers with other programming networks, pay-per-view, video-on-demand, online streaming and on-demand services and other content offered by Distributors and others. Additional companies, some with significant financial resources, continue to enter or are seeking to enter the video distribution market either by offering DTC streaming services or selling devices that aggregate viewing of various DTC services, which continues to put pressure on an already competitive landscape. We also compete for viewers and advertisers with content offered over the Internet, social media and social networking platforms, mobile media, radio, motion picture, home video and other sources of information and entertainment and advertising services. Important competitive factors are the prices we charge for our programming networks, the quantity, quality (in particular, the performance of the sports teams whose media rights we control), the variety of the programming offered on our networks, and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\nNew or existing programming networks that are owned by or affiliated with broadcast networks such as NBC, ABC, CBS or Fox, or broadcast station owners, such as Sinclair, may have a competitive advantage over our networks in obtaining distribution through the \u201cbundling\u201d of agreements to carry those programming networks with the agreement giving the Distributor the right to carry a broadcast station owned by or affiliated with the network. For example, regional sports and entertainment networks affiliated with broadcast networks are carried by certain Distributors that do not currently carry our networks. Our business depends, in part, upon viewer preferences and audience acceptance of the programming on our networks. These factors are often unpredictable and subject to influences that are beyond our control, such as the quality and appeal of competing programming, the performance of the sports teams whose media rights we control, general economic conditions and the availability of other entertainment options. We may not be able to successfully predict interest in proposed new programming and viewer preferences could cause new programming not to be successful or cause our existing programming to decline in popularity. If our programming does not gain or maintain the level of audience acceptance we, our advertisers or Distributors expect, it could negatively affect advertising or affiliation fee revenues. An increase in our costs associated with programming, including original programming, may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe recently launched a DTC streaming product, which provides consumers an alternative to accessing our programming through our Distributors, but there can be no assurance that we will successfully execute our strategy for such offering. Our DTC offering represents a new consumer offering for which we have limited prior experience and we may not be able to successfully predict the demand for such DTC product or the impact such DTC product may have on our traditional distribution business, including with respect to renewals of our affiliation agreements with Distributors. In addition, the success of our DTC product will depend on a number of factors, including competition from other DTC products, such as offerings from other regional sports networks. \n22\nThe extent to which competitive programming, including NBA and NHL games, are available on other programming networks and distribution platforms can adversely affect our competitive position.\nThe competitive environment in which our MSG Networks business operates may also be affected by technological developments. It is difficult to predict the future effect of technology on our competitive position. With respect to advertising services, factors affecting the degree and extent of competition include prices, reach and audience demographics, among others. Some of our competitors are large companies that have greater financial resources available to them than we do, which could impact our viewership and the resulting advertising revenues.\nOur\n \nOperations and Operating Results Were Materially Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Actions Taken in Response by Governmental Authorities and Certain Professional Sports Leagues, and a Resurgence of the COVID-19 Pandemic or Another Pandemic or Public Health Emergency Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations. \nThe Company\u2019s operations and operating results were materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (including COVID-19 variants) and actions taken in response by governmental authorities and certain professional sports leagues during Fiscal Year 2021. \nMSG Networks business.\n As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, both the NBA and the NHL reduced the number of regular season games for their 2020-21 seasons, resulting in MSG Networks airing substantially fewer NBA and NHL telecasts during Fiscal Year 2021, as compared with Fiscal Year 2019 (the last full fiscal year not impacted by COVID-19 as the 2019-20 seasons were temporarily suspended and subsequently shortened). Consequently, MSG Networks experienced a decrease in revenues, including a material decrease in advertising revenue. The absence of live sports games also resulted in a decrease in certain MSG Networks expenses, including rights fees, variable production expenses, and advertising sales commissions. MSG Networks aired full regular season telecast schedules in Fiscal Year 2022 and Fiscal Year 2023 for its five professional teams across both the NBA and NHL, and, as a result, its advertising revenue and certain operating expenses, including rights fees expense, reflect the same. \nSphere business\n. In April 2020, the Company announced that it was suspending construction of Sphere in Las Vegas due to COVID-19 related factors that were outside of its control, including supply chain issues. This is a complex construction project with cutting-edge technology that relied on subcontractors obtaining components from a variety of sources around the world. \nAs the ongoing effects of the pandemic continued to impact its business operations, in August 2020, the Company disclosed that it had resumed full construction with a lengthened timetable in order to better preserve cash through the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company expects to open the venue in September 2023. Although Sphere was not open during the pandemic, if it had been, its operations would have been suspended for a period of time and, similar to other venues, its operations would have been subject to safety protocols and social distancing upon reopening.\nIt is unclear to what extent pandemic concerns, including with respect to COVID-19 or other future pandemics, could result in professional sports leagues suspending, cancelling or otherwise reducing the number of games scheduled in the regular reason or playoffs, which could have a material impact on the distribution and/or advertising revenues of our MSG Networks segment, or could result in new government-mandated capacity or other restrictions or vaccination/mask requirements or impact the use of and/or demand for Sphere in Las Vegas, impact demand for our sponsorship and advertising assets, deter our employees and vendors from working at Sphere in Las Vegas (which may lead to difficulties in staffing), deter artists from touring or otherwise materially impact our operations. See \u201c \u2014Operational and Economic Risks \u2014 \nWe Are Subject to Extensive Governmental Regulation and Changes in These Regulations and Our Failure to Comply with Them May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations\n.\u201d \nOur business is particularly sensitive to reductions in travel and discretionary consumer spending. A pandemic, such as COVID-19, or the fear of a new pandemic or public health emergency, has in the past and could in the future impede economic activity in impacted regions and globally over the long term, leading to a decline in discretionary spending on entertainment and sports events and other leisure activities, which could result in long-term effects on our business. To the extent effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or another pandemic or public health emergency adversely affect our business and financial results, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, such as those relating to our liquidity, indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness. \nOur Business Has Been Adversely Impacted and May, in the Future, Be Materially Adversely Impacted by an Economic Downturn, Recession, Financial Instability, Inflation or Changes in Consumer Tastes and Preferences.\nOur business depends upon the ability and willingness of consumers and businesses to purchase tickets and license suites at Sphere, spend on food and beverages and merchandise, subscribe to packages of programming that includes our networks, and drive continued advertising, marketing partnership and affiliate fee revenues, and these revenues are sensitive to general economic conditions, recession, fears of recession and consumer behavior. Further, the live entertainment industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing businesses. These risks are exacerbated in our business in light of the fact that we only have one venue in Las Vegas, which is dependent on tourism travel for its success.\n23\nConsumer and corporate spending has in the past declined and may in the future decline at any time for reasons beyond our control. The risks associated with our businesses generally become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession, which may be accompanied by reductions in corporate sponsorship and advertising and decreases in attendance at events at our venue, among other things. In addition, inflation, which has significantly risen, has increased and may continue to increase operational costs, including labor costs, and continued increases in interest rates in re\nsponse to concerns about inflation may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks. As a result, instability and weakness of the U.S. and global economies, including due to the effects caused by disruptions to financial mark\nets, inflation, recession, high unemployment, geopolitical events, including any prolonged effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or another future pandemic, and the negative effects on consumers\u2019 and businesses\u2019 discretionary spending, have in the past materially negatively affected, and may in the future materially negatively affect, our business and results of operations. A prolonged period of reduced consumer or corporate spending, including with respect to advertising, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, could have an adverse effect on our business and our results of operations. See \u201c\u2014 Operational and Economic Risks \u2014 \nOur Operations and Operating Results Were Materially Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Actions Taken in Response by Governmental Authorities and Certain Professional Sports Leagues, and a Resurgence of the COVID-19 Pandemic or Another Pandemic or Public Health Emergency Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations\n.\u201d\nThe Geographic Concentration of Our Businesses Could Subject Us to Greater Risk Than Our Competitors and Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nThe Sphere business initially operates only in Las Vegas with one venue and, as a result, is subject to significantly greater degrees of risk than competitors with more operating properties or that operate in more markets. MSG Networks\u2019 programming networks are widely distributed throughout New York State and certain nearby areas. Therefore, the Company is particularly vulnerable to adverse events (including acts of terrorism, natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics, weather conditions, labor market disruptions and government actions) and economic conditions in Las Vegas and New York State, and surrounding areas. \nOur Business\n \nCould Be Adversely Affected by Terrorist Activity or the Threat of Terrorist Activity, Weather and Other Conditions That Discourage Congregation at Prominent Places of Public Assembly.\nThe success of our businesses is dependent upon the willingness and ability of patrons to attend events at our venue. The venue we operate, like all prominent places of public assembly, could be the target of terrorist activities, including acts of domestic terrorism, or other actions that discourage attendance. Any such activity or threatened activity at or near one of our venue or other similar venues, including those located elsewhere, could result in reduced attendance at our venue and a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. If our venue was unable to operate for an extended period of time, our business and operations would be materially adversely affected. Similarly, a major epidemic or pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or the threat or perceived threat of such an event, could adversely affect attendance at our events and venues by discouraging public assembly at our events and venue. Moreover, the costs of protecting against such incidents, including the costs of implementing additional protective measures for the health and safety of our guests, could reduce the profitability of our operations. See \u201c\u2014 Operational and Economic Risks \u2014 \nOur Operations and Operating Results Were Materially Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Actions Taken in Response by Governmental Authorities and Certain Professional Sports Leagues, and a Resurgence of the COVID-19 Pandemic or Another Pandemic or Public Health Emergency Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations\n.\u201d\nWeather or other conditions, including natural disasters, in locations which we own or operate venues may affect patron attendance as well as sales of food and beverages and merchandise, among other things. Weather conditions may also require us to cancel or postpone events. Weather or other conditions may prevent us or our Distributors from providing our programming to customers or reduce advertising expenditures. Any of these events may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations, and any such events may harm our ability to obtain or renew insurance coverage on favorable terms or at all.\nWe May Pursue Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions and/or Investments to Complement or Expand Our Business That May Not Be Successful; We Have Significant Investments in Businesses We Do Not Control.\nFrom time to time, we may explore opportunities to purchase or invest in other businesses, venues or assets that we believe will complement, enhance or expand our current business or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities, including opportunities that may differ from the Company\u2019s current businesses. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve risks, including the commitment of significant capital, the incurrence of indebtedness, the payment of advances, the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources from our existing business to develop and integrate the acquired or combined business, the inability to successfully integrate such business or assets into our operations, litigation or other claims in connection with acquisitions or against companies we invest in or acquire, our lack of control over certain companies, including joint ventures and other minority investments, the risk of not achieving the intended results and the exposure to losses if the underlying transactions or ventures are not successful. At times, we have had significant investments in businesses that we account for under the equity method of accounting, and we may again in the future. Certain of these investments have generated operating losses in the past and certain have required additional investments from us in the form of equity or loans. For example, we currently have equity method investments in SACO \n24\nTechnologies and Holoplot. There can be no assurance that these investments will become profitable individually or in the aggregate or that they will not require material additional funding from us in the future.\nWe may not control the day-to-day operations of these investments. We have in the past written down and, to the extent that these investments are not successful in the future, we may write down all or a portion of such investments. Additionally, these businesses may be subject to laws, rules and other circumstances, and have risks in their operations, which may be similar to, or different from, those to which we are subject. Any of the foregoing risks could result in a material negative effect on our business and results of operations or adversely impact the value of our investments.\nWe Are Subject to Extensive Governmental Regulation and Changes in These Regulations and Our Failure to Comply with Them May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations. \nOur business is subject to the general powers of federal, state and local governments, as well as foreign governmental authorities. Certain aspects of our MSG Networks business are also subject to certain rules, regulations and agreements of the NBA and NHL. Some FCC regulations apply to our MSG Networks business directly and other FCC regulations, although imposed on Distributors, affect programming networks indirectly.\n\u2022\nVenue-related Permits/Licenses\n. Sphere, like all public spaces, is subject to building and health codes and fire regulations imposed by state and local government as well as zoning and outdoor advertising and signage regulations. We also require a number of licenses to operate, including, but not limited to, occupancy permits, exhibition licenses, food and beverage permits, liquor licenses, signage entitlements and other authorizations. Failure to receive or retain, or the suspension of, liquor licenses or permits could interrupt or terminate our ability to serve alcoholic beverages at our venue. Additional regulation relating to liquor licenses may limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of compliance, or both. We are subject to statutes that generally provide that serving alcohol to a visibly intoxicated or minor patron is a violation of the law and may provide for strict liability for certain damages arising out of such violations. Our liability insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover any or all such potential liability. \nOur failure to maintain these permits or licenses could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations\n.\n\u2022\nPublic Health and Safety.\n As a result of government mandated assembly limitations and closures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, MSG Networks aired substantially fewer games in Fiscal Year 2021\n.\n There can be no assurance that some or all of these restrictions will not be imposed again in the future due to future outbreaks of COVID-19 (including variants) or another pandemic or public health emergency. We are unable to predict what the long-term effects of these events, including renewed government regulations or requirements, will be. For example, future governmental regulations adopted in response to a pandemic may impact the revenue we derive and/or the expenses we incur from the events that we choose to host, such that events that were historically profitable would instead result in losses. See \u201c\u2014 Operational and Economic Risks \u2014 \nOur Operations and Operating Results Were Materially Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Actions Taken in Response by Governmental Authorities and Certain Professional Sports Leagues, and a Resurgence of the COVID-19 Pandemic or Another Pandemic or Public Health Emergency Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations.\n\u2022\nEnvironmental Laws\n. We and our venue are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the use, disposal, storage, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances, as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect, among other things, the operations of our venue. Compliance with these regulations and the associated costs may be heightened as a result of the purchase, construction or renovation of a venue. Additionally, certain laws and regulations could hold us strictly, jointly and severally responsible for the remediation of hazardous substance contamination at our facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as for any personal injury or property damage related to any contamination. Our commercial general liability and/or the pollution legal liability insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover any or all such potential liability. \n\u2022\nBroadcasting.\n Legislative enactments, court actions, and federal and state regulatory proceedings could materially affect our programming business by modifying the rates, terms, and conditions under which we offer our content or programming networks to Distributors and the public, or otherwise materially affect the range of our activities or strategic business alternatives. We cannot predict the likelihood, results or impact on our business of any such legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions. Furthermore, to the extent that regulations and laws, either presently in force or proposed, hinder or stimulate the growth of Distributors, our business could be affected. The U.S. Congress and the FCC currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, amend, or repeal, laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect our business. The regulation of Distributors and programming networks is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux over the past two decades. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements may be proposed or adopted in the future. Our business and our results of operations may be materially negatively affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation. \n25\n\u2022\nData Privacy\n. We are subject to various data privacy and protection laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage, processing and use of personal information or personal data, which among other things, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy and security of personal information. The variety of laws and regulations governing data privacy and protection, and the use of the internet as a commercial medium, are rapidly evolving, extensive and complex, and may include provisions and obligations that are inconsistent with one another or uncertain in their scope or application. \nThe data protection landscape is rapidly evolving in the United States. As our operations and business grow, we may become subject to or affected by new or additional data protection laws and regulations and face increased scrutiny or attention from regulatory authorities. For example, California has passed a comprehensive data privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), and a number of other states, including Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut, have also passed similar laws, and various additional states may do so in the near future. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCPRA\u201d), imposes additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights procedures and obligations, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and constraints on certain uses of sensitive data. The majority of the CPRA provisions went into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. Further, there are several legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new privacy and security obligations. We cannot yet determine the impact that these future laws and regulations may have on our business.\nIn addition, governmental authorities and private litigants continue to bring actions against companies for online collection, use, dissemination and security practices that are unfair or deceptive. \nOur business is, and may in the future be, subject to a variety of other laws and regulations, including licensing, permitting, working conditions, labor, immigration and employment laws; health, safety and sanitation requirements; and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (and related state and local statutes). \nAny changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to our business could have an adverse impact on our businesses and our failure to comply with applicable governmental laws and regulations, or to maintain necessary permits or licenses, could result in liability or government actions that could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Business Has Been Subject to Seasonal Fluctuations, and Our Operating Results and Cash Flow Have In the Past Varied, and Could In the Future Vary, Substantially from Period to Period.\nOur revenues and expenses have been seasonal and may continue to be seasonal. For example, our MSG Networks segment generally continues to expect to earn a higher share of its annual revenues in the second and third quarters of its fiscal year as a result of MSG Networks\u2019 advertising revenue being largely derived from the sale of inventory in its live NBA and NHL professional sports programming\n. Therefor\ne, our operating results and cash flow reflect significant variation from period to period and will continue to do so in the future. Consequently, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and the operating results of one period are not indicative of our financial performance during a full fiscal year. This variability may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLabor Matters May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nIn the event of labor market disruptions due to renewed effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or other future pandemics and otherwise, we could face difficulty in maintaining staffing at our Sphere venue and retaining talent in our corporate departments. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified people or to do so on reasonable terms, Sphere could be short-staffed or become more expensive to operate and our ability to meet our guests\u2019 demand could be limited, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. \nOur business is dependent upon the efforts of unionized workers. As of June 30, 2023, approximately 29% of our employees were represented by unions. Approximately10% of such union employees were subject to CBAs that had expired as of June 30, 2023 and approximately 67% were subject to CBAs that will expire by June 30, 2024 if they are not extended prior thereto. Any labor disputes, such as strikes or lockouts, with the unions with which we have CBAs could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations (including our ability to produce or present immersive productions, concerts, programming, theatrical productions, sporting events and other events). For example, members of the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA commenced a work stoppage in May and July, 2023, respectively. If these or other work stoppages by unions involved in the production of original immersive productions are prolonged and we are unable to secure waivers from the guild or union concerned, it could adversely affect our business. \nAdditionally, NBA and NHL players are covered by CBAs and we may be impacted by union relationships of both such leagues. Both the NBA and the NHL have experienced labor difficulties in the past and may have labor issues in the future, such as player strikes or management lockouts. For example, the NBA has experienced labor difficulties, including a lockout during the 2011-12 NBA season, \n26\nwhich resulted in a regular season that was shortened from 82 games to 66 games.  In addition, the NHL has also experienced labor difficulties, including a lockout beginning in September 2004 that resulted in the cancellation of the entire 2004-05 NHL season, and a lockout during the 2012-13 NHL season, which resulted in a regular season that was shortened from 82 games to 48 games. \nIf any NBA or NHL games are cancelled because of any such labor difficulties, the loss of revenue, including from impacts to MSG Networks\u2019 ability to produce or present programming, would have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe Unavailability of Systems Upon Which We Rely May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nWe rely upon various internal and third-party software or systems in the operation of our business, including, with respect to ticket sales, credit card processing, email marketing, point of sale transactions, database, inventory, human resource management and financial systems, and other systems used to present Sphere events and attractions, such as audio and video. From time to time, certain of these arrangements may not be covered by long-term agreements. System interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in the information and other systems and infrastructure, both of our own websites and other computer systems and of affiliate and third-party software, computer networks, and other substructure and communications systems service providers on which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate websites, applications, process and fulfill transactions, respond to customer inquiries, present events, and generally maintain cost-efficient operations. Such interruptions could occur by virtue of natural disaster, malicious actions, such as hacking or acts of terrorism or war, human error, or other factors affecting such third parties. The failure or unavailability of these internal or third-party services or systems, depending upon its severity and duration, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.  See also \u201c\u2014 Risks Related to Governance and Our Controlled Ownership \u2014 \nWe Rely on Affiliated Entities\u2019 Performance Under Various Agreements\n\u201d for a discussion of services MSG Entertainment performs on our behalf.\nWhile we have backup systems and offsite data centers for certain aspects of our operations, disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be for all eventualities. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption. If any of these adverse events were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere Is a Risk of Injuries and Accidents in Connection with Sphere, Which Could Subject Us to Personal Injury or Other Claims; We Are Subject to the Risk of Adverse Outcomes in Other Types of Litigation.\nThere are inherent risks associated with producing and hosting events and operating, maintaining, renovating or constructing our venues (including as a result of Sphere\u2019s unique features). As a result, personal injuries, accidents and other incidents which may negatively affect guest satisfaction have occurred and may occur from time to time, which could subject us to claims and liabilities. \nThese risks may not be covered by insurance or could involve exposures that exceed the limits of any applicable insurance policy. Incidents in connection with events at Sphere could also reduce attendance at our events and may have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations. Although we seek to obtain contractual indemnities for events at our venues that we do not promote and we also maintain insurance policies that provide coverage for incidents in the ordinary course of business, there can be no assurance that such indemnities or insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances. \nFrom time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings, including proceedings or lawsuits brought by governmental agencies, stockholders, customers, employees, private parties and other stakeholders, such as the litigations related to the merger of a subsidiary of the Company with MSG Networks Inc. (the \u201cNetworks Merger\u201d). The outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable and, regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, harmful to our reputation and distracting to management. As a result, we may incur liability from litigation (including in connection with settling such litigation) which could be material and for which we may not have available or adequate insurance coverage, or be subject to other forms of non-monetary relief which may adversely affect the Company. By its nature, the outcome of litigation is difficult to assess and quantify, and its continuing defense is costly. The liabilities and any defense costs we incur in connection with any such litigation could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe Face Risk from Doing Business Internationally.\nWe have operations and own property outside of the United States. As a result, our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include:\n\u2022\nlaws and policies affecting trade and taxes, including laws and policies relating to currency, the repatriation of funds and withholding taxes, and changes in these laws; \n\u2022\nchanges in local regulatory requirements, including restrictions on foreign ownership; \n\u2022\nexchange rate fluctuation;\n27\n\u2022\nexchange controls, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ndiffering degrees of protection for intellectual property and varying attitudes towards the piracy of intellectual property; \n\u2022\nforeign privacy and data protection laws and regulations, such as the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, and changes in these laws; \n\u2022\nthe instability of foreign economies and governments; \n\u2022\nwar, acts of terrorism and the outbreak of epidemics or pandemics abroad; \n\u2022\nanti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations, and changes in these laws and regulations; and \n\u2022\nshifting consumer preferences regarding entertainment.\nEvents or developments related to these and other risks associated with international operations could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness, Financial Condition, and Internal Control\nWe Have Substantial Indebtedness and Are Highly Leveraged, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Business.\nWe are highly leveraged with a significant amount of debt and we may continue to incur additional debt in th\ne future. As of June 30, 2023, our total indebtedness was $1.1 billion, $82.5 million of which matures during Fiscal Year 2024. \nAs a result of our indebtedness, we are required to make interest and principal payments on our borrowings that are significant in relation to our revenues and cash flows. These payments reduce our earnings and cash available for other potential business purposes. Furthermore, our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase (including in connection with rising inflation) because our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates or to the extent we have to refinance existing debt with higher cost debt.\nIn September 2019, certain subsidiaries of MSG Networks Inc., including MSGN Holdings L.P. (\u201cMSGN L.P\n.\u201d), entered into a credit facility consisting of an initial five-year $1.1 billion term loan facility and a five-year $250 million revolving credit facility, (the \u201cMSGN Credit Facilities\u201d). \nOn December 22, 2022, MSG Las Vegas, LLC (\u201cMSG LV\u201d), entered into a credit agreement providing for a five-year, $275 million senior secured term loan facility (the \u201cLV Sphere Facility\u201d). All obligations under the LV Sphere Facility are guaranteed by Sphere Entertainment Group, LLC (\u201cSphere Entertainment Group\u201d). \n The MSGN Credit Facilities were obtained without recourse to the Company, Sphere Entertainment Group, or any of its subsidiaries, and the LV Sphere Facility was obtained without recourse to the Company, MSG Networks Inc., MSGN L.P., or any of its subsidiaries. \n We expect to refinance the MSG Networks Credit Facilities prior to their maturity in October 2024, including paying down a portion of the MSG Networks\u2019 term loan in connection therewith. Our ability to have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, including the creation of content, and refinance the MSG Networks Credit Facilities is dependent on the ability of Sphere in Las Vegas to generate significant positive cash flow during Fiscal Year 2024, as well as any proceeds from the sale of the MSGE Retained Interest.  Although \nwe anticipate that Sphere in Las Vegas will generate substantial revenue and adjusted operating income on an annual basis, there can be no assurances that guests, artists, promoters, advertisers and marketing partners will embrace this new platform. To the extent that our efforts do not result in a viable show or attraction, or to the extent that any such productions do not achieve expected levels of popularity among audiences, we may not generate the cash flows from operations necessary to fund our operations. Further, there can be no assurances that we will be able to dispose of all or a portion of the remainder of the MSGE Retained Interest on favorable terms due to market conditions or otherwise. \nThere can be no assurances that MSG Networks\u2019 lenders will refinance the MSG Networks\u2019 term loan. If we were not able to refinance the MSG Networks\u2019 term loan prior to its maturity in October 2024 or otherwise reach an agreement with such lenders, a default thereunder would be \ntriggered, which could result in an acceleration of outstanding debt thereunder and a foreclosure upon the MSG Networks business.\nIn addition, the ability of MSGN L.P. to draw on its revolving credit facilities will depend on its ability to meet certain financial covenants and other conditions. This leverage also exposes us to significant risk by limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business (whether through competitive pressure or otherwise), the entertainment and video programming industries and the economy at large. Although our cash flows could decrease in these scenarios, our required payments in respect of indebtedness would not decrease.\nIn addition, our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt, and to fund our operating and capital expenditures, depends largely upon our future operating performance and our ability to access the credit markets. Our future operating performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic conditions, recession, fears of recession, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations, or raise additional debt or equity capital. We cannot provide assurance that we could affect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or \n28\nat all, or that these actions would be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from effecting certain or any of these alternatives.\nEven if our future operating performance is strong, l\nimitations on our ability to access the capital or credit markets, including as a result of general economic conditions, unfavorable terms or general reductions in liquidity may adversely and materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe failure to satisfy the covenants, including any inability to attain a covenant waiver, and other requirements under each credit agreement could trigger a default thereunder, acceleration of outstanding debt thereunder and, with respect to the LV Sphere Facility, a demand for payment under the guarantee provided by Sphere Entertainment Group.  Additionally, the\n LV Sphere Facility and the MSGN Credit Facilities each restrict MSG LV and MSGN L.P., respectively, from making cash distributions to us unless certain financial covenants are met. Any failure to satisfy the covenants under our credit facilities \ncould negatively impact our liquidity and could have a negative effect on our businesses.\nIn addition, we have made investments in, or otherwise extended loans to, one or more businesses that we believe complement, enhance or expand our current business or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities and may make additional investments in, or otherwise extend loans to, one or more of such parties in the future. For example, have invested in and have extended financing to Holoplot in connection with Sphere\u2019s advanced audio system. To the extent that such parties do not perform as expected, including with respect to repayment of such loans, it could impair such assets or create losses related to such loans, and, as a result, have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Variable Rate Indebtedness Subjects Us to Interest Rate Risk, Which Has Caused, and May Continue to Cause, Our Debt Service Obligations to Increase Significantly.\nBorrowings under our facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Interest rates have increased significantly (including in connection with rising inflation), and, as a result, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness have increased significantly even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, have correspondingly decreased. Further increases in interest rates will cause additional increases in our debt service obligations.\nWe May Require Additional Financing to Fund Certain of Our Obligations, Ongoing Operations, and Capital Expenditures, the Availability of Which Is Uncertain.\nThe capital and credit markets can experience volatility and disruption. Those markets can exert extreme downward pressure on stock prices and upward pressure on the cost of new debt capital and can severely restrict credit availability for most issuers. For example, the global economy, including credit and financial markets, has recently experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rising interest and inflation rates, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. If the equity and credit markets continue to deteriorate, or the United States enters a recession, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on favorable terms, more costly or more dilutive.\nOur Sphere business has been characterized by significant expenditures for properties, businesses, renovations and productions. We may require additional financing to fund our planned capital expenditures, as well as other obligations and our ongoing operations. In the future, we may engage in transactions that depend on our ability to obtain funding. For example, as we extend Sphere beyond Las Vegas, our intention is to utilize several options, such as joint ventures, equity partners, a managed venue model and non-recourse debt financing. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete these plans.\nDepending upon conditions in the financial markets and/or the Company\u2019s financial performance, we may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to pursue our current and future spending programs, we may be forced to cancel or scale back those programs. Failure to successfully pursue our capital expenditure and other spending plans could negatively affect our ability to compete effectively and have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe Have Incurred Substantial Operating Losses, Adjusted Operating Losses and Negative Cash Flow and There is No Assurance We Will Have Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income or Positive Cash Flow in the Future.\nWe incurred operating \nlosses of $273 million and $166 million for Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, we have in prior periods incurred operating losses and negative cash \nflow and there is no assurance that we will have operating income, adjusted operating income, or positive cash flow in the future. Significant operating losses may limit our ability to raise necessary financing, or to do so on favorable terms, as such losses could be taken into account by potential investors and lenders. See \u201cPart II \u2014 Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Factors Affecting Operating Results.\u201d\nWe Are Required to Assess Our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting on an Annual Basis and Our Management Identified a Material Weakness During Fiscal Year 2022, Which Has Now Been Remediated. If We Identify Other Material Weaknesses or \n29\nAdverse Findings in the Future, Our Ability to Report Our Financial Condition or Results of Operations Accurately or Timely May Be Adversely Affected, Which May Result in a Loss of Investor Confidence in Our Financial Reports, Significant Expenses to Remediate Any Internal Control Deficiencies, and Ultimately Have an Adverse Effect on the Market Price of Our Common Stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, our management is required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. Annually, we perform activities that include reviewing, documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we will not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could result in significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies and lead to a decline in our stock price.\nSubsequent to the filing of the Fiscal Year 2021 Form 10-K, management of the Company evaluated an immaterial accounting error related to interest costs that should have been capitalized for Sphere in Las Vegas in Fiscal Years 2021, 2020 and 2019 and in the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2021, as prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 835-20 (\nCapitalization of Interest\n). As a result of the accounting error, the Company re-evaluated the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and identified a material weakness as of June 30, 2021, September 30, 2021, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022. \nWe undertook certain remediation efforts by implementing additional controls which were operating effectively as of June 30, 2022, and as a result, our management has concluded that the material weakness has been remediated and our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2022.\n  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibil\nity that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. \nOur management may be unable to conclude in future periods that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective due to the effects of various factors, which may, in part, include unremediated material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in those reports is accumulated and communicated to the company\u2019s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In addition, we may not be able to identify and remediate other control deficiencies, including material weaknesses, in the future.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property\nWe Face Continually Evolving Cybersecurity and Similar Risks, Which Could Result in Loss, Disclosure, Theft, Destruction or Misappropriation of, or Access to, Our Confidential Information and Cause Disruption of Our Business, Damage to Our Brands and Reputation, Legal Exposure and Financial Losses. \nThrough our operations, we collect and store, including by electronic means, certain personal, proprietary and other sensitive information, including payment card information, that is provided to us through purchases, registration on our websites, mobile applications, or otherwise in communication or interaction with us. These activities require the use of online services and centralized data storage, including through third-party service providers. Data maintained in electronic form is subject to the risk of security incidents, including breach, compromise, intrusion, tampering, theft, destruction, misappropriation or other malicious activity. Our ability to safeguard such personal and other sensitive information, including information regarding the Company and our customers, sponsors, partners, Distributors, advertisers and employees, independent contractors and vendors, is important to our business. We take these matters seriously and take significant steps to protect our stored information, including the implementation of systems and processes to thwart malicious activity. These protections are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. See \n\u201c\n\u2014 Economic and Operational Risks \u2014 \nWe Are Subject to Extensive Governmental Regulation and Changes in These Regulations and Our Failure to Comply with Them May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\u201d\nDespite our efforts, the risks of a security incident cannot be entirely eliminated and our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit consumer, sponsor, partner, Distributor, advertiser, Company, employee and other confidential and proprietary information may be compromised due to employee error or other circumstances such as malware or ransomware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, business email compromises, or otherwise. A compromise of our or our vendors\u2019 systems could affect the security of information on our network or that of a third-party service provider. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, vendors or users to disclose sensitive, proprietary or confidential information in order to gain access to data and systems. As a result, our or our customers\u2019 or affiliates\u2019 sensitive, proprietary and/or confidential information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without consent. \n30\nWe also continue to review and enhance our security measures in light of the constantly evolving techniques used to gain unauthorized access to networks, data, software and systems. We may be required to incur significant expenses in order to address any actual or potential security incidents that arise and we may not have insurance coverage for any or all of such expenses. \nIf we experience an actual or perceived security incident, our ability to conduct business may be interrupted or impaired, we may incur damage to our systems, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. Unauthorized access to or security breaches of our systems could result in the loss of data, loss of business, severe reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, diversion of management\u2019s attention, regulatory investigations and orders, litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations and significant costs for remediation that may include liability for stolen or lost assets or information and repair of system damage that may have been caused, incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships after a breach and other liabilities. In addition, in the event of a security incident, changes in legislation may increase the risk of potential litigation. For example, the CCPA, which provides a private right of action (in addition to statutory damages) for California residents whose sensitive personal information is breached as a result of a business\u2019 violation of its duty to reasonably secure such information, took effect on January 1, 2020 and was expanded by the CPRA in January 2023. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the costs of a data breach, indemnification obligations, or other liabilities.\nIn addition, in some instances, we may have obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. Such mandatory disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity, may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures and may require us to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to or alleviate problems caused by an actual or perceived security breach.\nWe May Become Subject to Infringement or Other Claims Relating to Our Content or Technology.\nFrom time to time, third parties may assert against us alleged intellectual property infringement claims (e.g., copyright, trademark and patent) or other claims relating to our productions, brands, programming, technologies, digital products and/or content or other content or material, some of which may be important to our business. In addition, our productions and/or programming could potentially subject us to claims of defamation, violation of rights of privacy or publicity or similar types of allegations. Any such claims, regardless of their merit or outcome, could cause us to incur significant costs that could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against, or have insurance coverage for, claims or costs of these types. In addition, if we are unable to continue use of certain intellectual property rights, our business and results of operations could be materially negatively impacted.\nTheft of Our Intellectual Property May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and monetize our intellectual property rights, including the technology being developed for Sphere,  MSG Networks (including our DTC product), our brand logos, our programming, technologies, digital content and other content that is material to our business. Theft of our intellectual property, including content, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations because it may reduce the revenue that we are able to receive from the legitimate exploitation of such intellectual property, undermine lawful distribution channels and limit our ability to control the marketing of our content and inhibit our ability to recoup or profit from the costs incurred to create such content. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or protect our trade secrets. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of the outcome, could cause us to incur significant costs, as well as subject us to the other inherent risks of litigation discussed above.\nRisks Related to Governance and Our Controlled Ownership \nWe Are Materially Dependent on Affiliated Entities\u2019 Performances Under Various Agreements.\nWe have entered into various agreements with MSG Entertainment related to the MSGE Distribution and with MSG Sports with respect to the 2020 Entertainment Distribution, and MSG Networks has various agreements with MSG Sports in connection with the 2015 Sports Distribution, including, among others, a distribution agreement, a tax disaffiliation agreement, a services agreement, an employee matters agreement and certain other arrangements (including other support services). These agreements include the allocation of employee benefits, taxes and certain other liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to, at and after the applicable distribution. In connection with the 2015 Sports Distribution, the 2020 Entertainment Distribution and the MSGE Distribution, we provided MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment, respectively, with indemnities with respect to liabilities arising out of our business, and MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment, respectively, provided us with indemnities with respect to liabilities arising out of the business retained by them. MSG Networks\u2019 media rights agreements with MSG Sports provide us with the exclusive live local media rights to Knicks and Rangers games. Rights fees under these media rights agreements amounted to approximately $172.6 million for Fiscal Year 2023. The stated contractual rights fees under such rights agreements increase annually and are subject to adjustments in certain circumstances, including if MSG Sports does not make available a minimum number of exclusive live games in any year.\nEach Company, MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment rely on the others to perform their respective obligations under these agreements. If MSG Sports or MSG Entertainment were to breach or become unable to satisfy its respective material obligations under \n31\nthese agreements, including a failure to satisfy its indemnification or other financial obligations, or these agreements otherwise terminate or expire and we do not enter into replacement agreements, we could suffer operational difficulties and/or significant losses.\nThe MSGE Distribution Could Result in Significant Tax Liability. \nWe received an opinion from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP substantially to the effect that, among other things, the MSGE Distribution should qualify as a tax-free distribution under the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d). The opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Certain transactions related to the MSGE Distribution that are not addressed by the opinion could result in the recognition of income or gain by us. The opinion relied on factual representations and reasonable assumptions, which, if incorrect or inaccurate, may jeopardize the ability to rely on such opinion.\nIf the MSGE Distribution does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then, in general, we would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of MSG Entertainment common stock distributed in the MSGE Distribution over our tax basis therein (i.e., as if we had sold such MSG Entertainment common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value). In addition, the receipt by our stockholders of common stock of MSG Entertainment would be a taxable distribution, and each U.S. holder that received MSG Entertainment common stock in the MSGE Distribution would be treated as if the U.S. holder had received a distribution equal to the fair market value of MSG Entertainment common stock that was distributed to it, which generally would be treated first as a taxable dividend to the extent of such holder\u2019s pro rata share of our earnings and profits, then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the holder\u2019s tax basis in our common stock, and thereafter as capital gain with respect to any remaining value. It is expected that the amount of any such taxes to us and our stockholders would be substantial. See \n\u201c\u2014 We May Have a Significant Indemnity Obligation to MSG Entertainment if the MSGE Distribution Is Treated as a Taxable Transaction.\u201d \nWe May Have a Significant Indemnity Obligation to MSG Entertainment if the MSGE Distribution Is Treated as a Taxable Transaction. \nWe have entered into a Tax Disaffiliation Agreement with MSG Entertainment (the \u201cTax Disaffiliation Agreement\u201d), which sets out each party\u2019s rights and obligations with respect to federal, state, local or foreign taxes for periods before and after the MSGE Distribution and related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of IRS and other audits. Pursuant to the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, we are required to indemnify MSG Entertainment for losses and taxes of MSG Entertainment resulting from the breach of certain covenants and for certain taxable gain recognized by MSG Entertainment, including as a result of certain acquisitions of our stock or assets. If we are required to indemnify MSG Entertainment under the circumstances set forth in the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.   \nThe 2020 Entertainment Distribution Could Result in Significant Tax Liability. \nMSG Sports received an opinion from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP substantially to the effect that, among other things, the 2020 Entertainment Distribution qualified as a tax-free distribution under the Code. The opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Certain transactions related to the 2020 Entertainment Distribution that are not addressed by the opinion could result in the recognition of income or gain by MSG Sports The opinion relied on factual representations and reasonable assumptions, which, if incorrect or inaccurate, may jeopardize the ability to rely on such opinion.\nIf the 2020 Entertainment Distribution does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then, in general, MSG Sports would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common stock distributed in the 2020 Entertainment Distribution over MSG Sports\u2019 tax basis therein (i.e., as if it had sold such common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value). In addition, the receipt by MSG Sports\u2019 stockholders of common stock of our Company would be a taxable distribution, and each U.S. holder that received our common stock in the 2020 Entertainment Distribution would be treated as if the U.S. holder had received a distribution equal to the fair market value of our common stock that was distributed to it, which generally would be treated first as a taxable dividend to the extent of such holder\u2019s pro rata share of MSG Sports\u2019 earnings and profits, then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the holder\u2019s tax basis in its MSG Sports\u2019 common stock, and thereafter as capital gain with respect to any remaining value. It is expected that the amount of any such taxes to MSG Sports stockholders and MSG Sports would be substantial. See \n\u201c\u2014 We May Have a Significant Indemnity Obligation to MSG Sports if the 2020 Entertainment Distribution Is Treated as a Taxable Transaction.\u201d \nWe May Have a Significant Indemnity Obligation to MSG Sports if the 2020 Entertainment Distribution Is Treated as a Taxable Transaction. \nWe have entered into a Tax Disaffiliation Agreement with MSG Sports (the \u201cTax Disaffiliation Agreement\u201d), which sets out each party\u2019s rights and obligations with respect to federal, state, local or foreign taxes for periods before and after the 2020 Entertainment Distribution and related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of IRS and other audits. Pursuant to the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, we are required to indemnify MSG Sports for losses and taxes of MSG Sports resulting from the breach of certain covenants and for certain taxable gain recognized by MSG Sports, including as a result of certain acquisitions of our stock or \n32\nassets. If we are required to indemnify MSG Sports under the circumstances set forth in the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.  \nCertain Adverse U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences Might Apply to Non-U.S. Holders That Hold Our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock If We Are Treated as a USRPHC.\nThe Company has not made a determination as to whether we are deemed to be a USRPHC, as defined in section 897(c)(2) of the Code. In general, we would be considered a USRPHC if 50% or more of the fair market value of our assets constitute \u201cUnited States real property interests\u201d within the meaning of the Code. However, the determination of whether we are a USRPHC turns on the relative fair market value of our United States real property interests and our other assets, and because the USRPHC rules are complex and the determination of whether we are a USRPHC depends on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we can give no assurance as to our USRPHC status after the MSGE Distribution. If we are treated as a USRPHC, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences might apply to non-U.S. holders that hold our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.\nWe Are Controlled by the Dolan Family. As a Result of Their Control, the Dolan Family Has the Ability to Prevent or Cause a Change in Control or Approve, Prevent or Influence Certain Actions by the Company.\nWe have two classes of common stock:\n\u2022\nClass A Common Stock, which is entitled to one vote per share and is entitled collectively to elect 25% of our Board of Directors; and\n\u2022\nClass B Common Stock, which is entitled to 10 votes per share and is entitled collectively to elect the remaining 75% of our Board of Directors.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Dolan family, including trusts for the benefit of members of the Dolan family (collectively, the \u201cDolan Family Group\u201d), collectively owns 100% of our Class B Common Stock, approximately 5.5% of our outstanding Class A Common Stock (inclusive of options exercisable within 60 days of June 30, 2023) and approximately 72.3% of the total voting power of all our outstanding common stock. The members of the Dolan Family Group holding Class B Common Stock are parties to a Stockholders Agreement, which has the effect of causing the voting power of the holders of our Class B Common Stock to be cast as a block with respect to all matters to be voted on by holders of our Class B Common Stock. Under the Stockholders Agreement, the shares of Class B Common Stock owned by members of the Dolan Family Group (representing all the outstanding Class B Common Stock) are to be voted on all matters in accordance with the determination of the Dolan Family Committee (as defined below), except that the decisions of the Dolan Family Committee are non-binding with respect to the Class B Common Stock owned by certain Dolan family trusts that collectively own approximately 40.5% of the outstanding Class B Common Stock (\u201cExcluded Trusts\u201d). The \u201cDolan Family Committee\u201d consists of Charles F. Dolan and his six children, James L. Dolan, Thomas C. Dolan, Patrick F. Dolan, Kathleen M. Dolan, Marianne Dolan Weber and Deborah A. Dolan-Sweeney. The Dolan Family Committee generally acts by majority vote, except that approval of a going-private transaction must be approved by a two-thirds vote and approval of a change-in-control transaction must be approved by not less than all but one vote. The voting members of the Dolan Family Committee are James L. Dolan, Thomas C. Dolan, Kathleen M. Dolan, Deborah A. Dolan-Sweeney and Marianne Dolan Weber, with each member having one vote other than James L. Dolan, who has two votes. Because James L. Dolan has two votes, he has the ability to block Dolan Family Committee approval of any Company change in control transaction. Shares of Class B Common Stock owned by Excluded Trusts will on all matters be voted on in accordance with the determination of the Excluded Trusts holding a majority of the Class B Common Stock held by all Excluded Trusts, except in the case of a vote on a going-private transaction or a change in control transaction, in which case a vote of the trusts holding two-thirds of the Class B Common Stock owned by Excluded Trusts is required.\nThe Dolan Family Group is able to prevent a change in control of our Company and no person interested in acquiring us would be able to do so without obtaining the consent of the Dolan Family Group. The Dolan Family Group, by virtue of its stock ownership, has the power to elect all of our directors subject to election by holders of Class B Common Stock and is able collectively to control stockholder decisions on matters on which holders of all classes of our common stock vote together as a single class. These matters could include the amendment of some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and the approval of fundamental corporate transactions.\nIn addition, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66\n 2\n\u2044\n3\n% of the outstanding shares of the Class B Common Stock, voting separately as a class, is required to approve:\n\u2022\nthe authorization or issuance of any additional shares of Class B Common Stock; and\n\u2022\nany amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation that adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights of the Class B Common Stock.\nAs a result, the Dolan Family Group has the power to prevent such issuance or amendment.\n33\nThe Dolan Family Group also controls MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and AMC Networks Inc. (\u201cAMC Networks\u201d) and, prior to the Networks Merger, the Dolan Family Group also controlled MSG Networks.\nWe Have Elected to Be a \u201cControlled Company\u201d for NYSE Purposes Which Allows Us Not to Comply with Certain of the Corporate Governance Rules of NYSE.\nMembers of the Dolan Family Group have entered into the Stockholders Agreement relating, among other things, to the voting of their shares of our Class B Common Stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the corporate governance rules of NYSE. As a controlled company, we have the right to elect not to comply with the corporate governance rules of NYSE requiring: (i) a majority of independent directors on our Board of Directors; (ii) an independent corporate governance and nominating committee; and (iii) an independent compensation committee. Our Board of Directors has elected for the Company to be treated as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under NYSE corporate governance rules and not to comply with the NYSE requirement for a majority-independent board of directors and for an independent corporate governance and nominating committee because of our status as a controlled company. Nevertheless, our Board of Directors has elected to comply with the NYSE requirement for an independent compensation committee.\nFuture Stock Sales, Including as a Result of the Exercise of Registration Rights by Certain of Our Stockholders, Could Adversely Affect the Trading Price of Our Class A Common Stock.\nCertain parties have registration rights covering a portion of our shares.\nWe have entered into registration rights agreements with Charles F. Dolan, members of his family, certain Dolan family interests and the Dolan Family Foundation that provide them with \u201cdemand\u201d and \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights with respect to approximately 6.9 million shares of Class A Common Stock, including shares issuable upon conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock. \nSales of a substantial number of shares of Class A Common Stock, including sales pursuant to these registration rights agreements, could adversely affect the market price of the Class A Common Stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities.\nWe Share Certain Directors, Officers and Employees with MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and/or AMC Networks, Which Means Those Individuals Do Not Devote Their Full Time and Attention to Our Affairs and the Overlap May Give Rise to Conflicts.\nOur Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James L. Dolan, also serves as the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MSG Entertainment, the Executive Chairman of MSG Sports and as Non-Executive Chairman of AMC Networks. Furthermore, ten members of our Board of Directors (including James L. Dolan) also serve as directors of MSG Sports, nine members of our Board of Directors (including James L. Dolan) also serve as directors of MSG Entertainment, and seven members of our Board of Directors (including James L. Dolan) serve as directors of AMC Networks and Charles F. Dolan serves as Chairman Emeritus of AMC Networks concurrently with his service on our Board. Our Executive Vice President, David Granville-Smith also serves as Executive Vice President of MSG Sports and AMC Networks. Our Vice Chairman, Gregg G. Seibert, also serves as the Vice Chairman of MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and AMC Networks, and our Secretary, Mark C. Cresitello, also serves as Senior Vice President, Associate General Counsel and Secretary of MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment. As a result, these individuals do not devote their full time and attention to the Company\u2019s affairs. The overlapping directors, officers and employees may have actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting each company. For example, the potential for a conflict of interest when we on the one hand, and MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and/or AMC Networks and their respective subsidiaries and successors on the other hand, look at certain acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for more than one of the companies. Also, conflicts may arise if there are issues or disputes under the commercial arrangements that exist between MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment or AMC Networks (each referred to as an \u201cOther Entity\u201d) and us. In addition, certain of our directors, officers and employees hold MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and/or AMC Networks stock, stock options and/or restricted stock units. These ownership interests could create actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our Company and an Other Entity. For a discussion of certain procedures we have implemented to help ameliorate such potential conflicts that may arise, see our Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on October 26, 2022.\nOur Overlapping Directors and Officers with MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and/or AMC Networks May Result in the Diversion of Corporate Opportunities to MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and/or AMC Networks and Other Conflicts and Provisions in Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation May Provide Us No Remedy in That Circumstance.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that directors and officers of the Company (the \u201cOverlap Persons\u201d) may also be serving as directors, officers, employees, consultants or agents of an Other Entity, and that the Company may engage in material business transactions with such Other Entities. The Company has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that no Overlap Person will be liable to the Company or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise occur by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of opportunities set forth in our amended and restated \n34\ncertificate of incorporation) to one or more of the Other Entities instead of the Company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunities to the Company. These provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also expressly validate certain contracts, agreements, arrangements and transactions (and amendments, modifications or terminations thereof) between the Company and the Other Entities and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provided that the actions of the Overlap Person in connection therewith are not breaches of fiduciary duties owed to the Company, any of its subsidiaries or their respective stockholders.

New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Form 10-K may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, except as required by law, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Form 10-K to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.\nMSGE Distribution\nOn April 20, 2023 (the \u201cMSGE Distribution Date\u201d), the Company distributed approximately 67% of the outstanding common stock of MSG Entertainment\n \n(the \u201cMSGE Distribution\u201d), with the Company retaining approximately 33% of the outstanding common stock of MSG Entertainment (in the form of MSG Entertainment Class A common stock) immediately following the MSGE Distribution (the \u201cMSGE Retained Interest\u201d). Following the MSGE Distribution Date, the Company retained the Sphere and MSG Networks businesses and MSG Entertainment now owns the traditional live entertainment business previously owned and operated by the Company through its Entertainment business segment, excluding the Sphere business. In the MSGE Distribution, stockholders of the Company received (a) one share of MSG Entertainment\u2019s Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for every share of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (\u201cClass A common stock\u201d), held of record as of the close of business, New York City time, on April 14, 2023 (the \u201cRecord Date\u201d), and (b) one share of MSG Entertainment\u2019s Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for every share of the Company\u2019s Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (\u201cClass B common stock\u201d), held of record as of the close of business, New York City time, on the Record Date. Concurrently with the MSGE Distribution, the Company entered into a delayed draw term loan (the \u201cDDTL Facility\u201d) with a subsidiary of MSG Entertainment that provided for a $65,000 senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility. The DDTL Facility was fully drawn on July\u00a014, 2023 and on August 9, 2023, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the DDTL Facility (including accrued interest and commitment fees) using a portion of the MSGE Retained Interest. \nFollowing the sale of a portion of the MSGE Retained Interest and the repayment of the DDTL Facility, the Company now holds approximately 17% of the outstanding common stock of MSG Entertainment (in the form of MSG Entertainment Class A common stock), based on 49,128 total shares of MSG Entertainment common stock outstanding as of August 18, 2023.\nAs of April 20, 2023, the MSG Entertainment business met the criteria for discontinued operations and was classified as a discontinued operation. See Note 3. Discontinued Operations to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding the MSGE Distribution.\nTao Group Hospitality Disposition\nOn May 3, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its 66.9% majority interest in TAO Group Sub-Holdings LLC (\u201cTao Group Hospitality\u201d) to a subsidiary of Mohari Hospitality Limited, a global investment company focused on the luxury lifestyle and hospitality sectors (the \u201cTao Group Hospitality Disposition\u201d).\nSince March 31, 2023, the Tao Group Hospitality segment met the criteria for discontinued operations and was classified as a discontinued operation. See Note 3. Discontinued Operations to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding the Tao Group Hospitality Disposition. \n41\nAfter giving effect to the MSGE Distribution and Tao Group Hospitality Disposition, the Company operates and reports financial information in two reportable segments: Sphere and MSG Networks.\nIntroduction \nThis MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations\n.\nOur MD&A is organized as follows: \nBusiness Overview.\n This section provides a general description of our business, as well as other matters that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition and in anticipating future trends.\nResults of Operations.\n This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for Fiscal Years 2023, 2022, and 2021 on both a (i) consolidated basis and (ii) segment basis\n.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources.\n This section provides a discussion of our financial condition and liquidity, as well as an analysis of our cash flows for Fiscal Years 2023, 2022, and 2021. The discussion of our financial condition and liquidity includes summaries of our primary sources of liquidity, our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements that existed at June\u00a030, 2023.\nSeasonality of Our Business.\n This section discusses the seasonal performance of our business\n.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Policies\n. This section cross-references a discussion of critical accounting policies considered to be important to our financial condition and results of operations and which require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. Our critical accounting policies and recently issued accounting pronouncements, are discussed included in Items 7 and 8, respectively, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  \nBusiness Overview \nSphere Entertainment Co. is a premier live entertainment and media company comprised of two reportable segments, Sphere and MSG Networks. Sphere is a next-generation entertainment medium, and MSG Networks operates two regional sports and entertainment networks, as well as a direct-to-consumer and authenticated streaming product.\nSphere\n: This segment reflects Sphere, a next-generation entertainment medium powered by cutting-edge technologies that we believe will enable multi-sensory storytelling at an unparalleled scale. The Company\u2019s first Sphere is expected to open in Las Vegas in September 2023. The venue can accommodate up to 20,000 guests and is expected to host a wide variety of events year-round, including The Sphere Experience\nTM\n, which will feature original immersive productions, as well as concerts and residencies from renowned artists, and marquee sporting and corporate events. Supporting this strategy is Sphere Studios, which is home to a team of creative, production, technology and software experts who provide full in-house creative and production services. The studio campus in Burbank includes a 68,000-square-foot development facility, as well as Big Dome, a 28,000-square-foot, 100-foot high custom dome, with a quarter-sized version of the screen at Sphere in Las Vegas, that serves as a specialized screening, production facility, and lab for content at Sphere.\nMSG Networks:\n This segment is comprised of the Company\u2019s regional sports and entertainment networks, MSG Network and MSG Sportsnet, as well as its direct-to-consumer streaming product, MSG+. MSG Networks serves the New York Designated Market Area, as well as other portions of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania and features a wide range of sports content, including exclusive live local games and other programming of the New York Knicks (the \u201cKnicks\u201d) of the National Basketball Association (the \u201cNBA\u201d) and the New York Rangers (the \u201cRangers\u201d), New York Islanders (the \u201cIslanders\u201d), New Jersey Devils (the \u201cDevils\u201d) and Buffalo Sabres (the \u201cSabres\u201d) of the National Hockey League (the \u201cNHL\u201d), as well as significant coverage of the New York Giants (the \u201cGiants\u201d) and the Buffalo Bills (the \u201cBills\u201d) of the National Football League (the \u201cNFL\u201d).\nDescription of Our Segments\nSphere \nRevenue Sources \u2014 Sphere \nThe Sphere segment has yet to generate material revenue during Sphere\u2019s pre-opening period. See Note\u00a02. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our accounting policies on revenue recognition. \n42\nExpenses \u2014 Sphere\nThe Sphere segment incurs non-capitalizable content development and technology costs associated with the Company\u2019s Sphere initiative. Sphere also incurs corporate and supporting department operating costs that are attributable to Sphere development, including charges under the transition services agreement with MSG Entertainment (the \u201cMSGE TSA\u201d), costs associated with the promotion of events through various advertising campaigns, and non-event related operating expenses such as insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, labor related to the overall management of the Sphere segment and depreciation and amortization expense related to certain corporate property, equipment and leasehold improvements. See Note\u00a02. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our accounting policies on direct operating expenses. \nMSG Networks\nRevenue Sources \u2014 MSG Networks\nThe MSG Networks segment generates revenues principally from affiliation fees, as well as from the sale of advertising. For Fiscal Year 2023\n, this segment represented approximately 99.5% of our consolidated revenues.\nAffiliation Fee Revenue\nAffiliation fee revenue is earned from Distributors for the right to carry the Company\u2019s networks. The fees we receive depend largely on the demand from subscribers for our programming.\nAdvertising Revenue\nThe MSG Networks\u2019 advertising revenue is largely derived from the sale of inventory in its live professional sports programming. As such, a disproportionate share of this revenue is earned in the second and third fiscal quarters. In certain advertising arrangements, the Company guarantees specific viewer ratings for its programming.\nExpenses \n\u2014 MSG Networks\nDirect operating expenses primarily include the cost of professional team rights acquired under media rights agreements to telecast various sporting events on our networks, and other direct programming and production-related costs of our networks.\nMSG Networks is a party to long-term media rights agreements with the Knicks and the Rangers, which provide the Company with the exclusive live media rights to the teams\u2019 games in their local markets. In addition, MSG Networks has  media rights agreements with the Islanders, Devils and Sabres. The media rights acquired under these agreements to telecast various sporting events and other programming for exhibition on our networks are typically expensed on a straight-line basis over the applicable annual contract or license period. We negotiate directly with the teams to determine the fee and other provisions of the media rights agreements. Media rights fees for sports programming are influenced by, among other things, the size and demographics of the geographic area in which the programming is distributed, and the popularity and/or the competitiveness of a team.\nOther direct programming and production-related costs include, but are not limited to, the salaries of on-air personalities, producers, directors, technicians, writers and other creative staff, as well as expenses associated with location costs, remote facilities and maintaining studios, origination, and transmission services and facilities.\nOther Expenses\nThe Company\u2019s selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of administrative costs, including compensation, professional fees, advertising sales commissions, as well as sales and marketing costs, including non-event related advertising expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for periods prior to the MSGE Distribution include certain corporate overhead expenses that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in discontinued operations.\nPrior to December 31, 2022, MSG Networks was party to an advertising sales representation agreement \n(the \u201cNetworks Advertising Sales Representation Agreement\u201d)\n with MSG Entertainment that gave MSG Entertainment the exclusive right and obligation to sell certain of MSG Networks\u2019 advertising availabilities for a commission. \nThe Networks Advertising Sales Representation Agreement was terminated effective as of December 31, 2022.  Starting January 1, 2023, all costs incurred by MSG Networks to sell advertising (that was previously performed by MSG Entertainment) are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses.  \n43\nFactors Affecting Operating Results \nThe operating results of our Sphere segment will be largely dependent on our ability to attract audiences to The Sphere Experience, and advertisers and marketing partners, as well as guests and artists to residencies, concerts and other events at our venue. The operating results of our MSG Networks segment are largely dependent on the affiliation agreements MSG Networks negotiates with Distributors, the number of subscribers of certain Distributors, the success of our DTC product, and the advertising rates we charge advertisers. Certain of these factors in turn depend on the popularity and/or performance of the professional sports teams whose games we broadcast on our networks.\nOur Company\u2019s future performance is dependent in part on general economic conditions and the effect of these conditions on our customers. Weak economic conditions may lead to lower demand for our entertainment offerings (including The Sphere Experience) and programming content, which would also negatively affect concession and merchandise sales, and could lead to lower levels of advertising, sponsorship and venue signage. These conditions may also affect the number of immersive productions, concerts, residencies and other events that take place in the future. An economic downturn could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe Company continues to explore additional opportunities to expand our presence in the entertainment industry. Any new investment may not initially contribute to operating income, but is intended to contribute to the success of the Company over time. Our results will also be affected by investments in, and the success of, new immersive productions.\nFactors Affecting Comparability \nThe Company\u2019s operations and operating results were materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic \nand actions taken in response by governmental authorities and certain professional sports leagues during Fiscal Year 2021. As a result of the shortened 2020-21 NBA and NHL seasons, \nMSG Networks aired substantially fewer NBA and NHL telecasts during Fiscal Year 2021, as compared with Fiscal Year 2019 (the last full fiscal year not impacted by COVID-19), and consequently experienced a decrease in revenues, including a material decrease in advertising revenue. The absence of live sports games also resulted in a decrease in certain MSG Networks expenses, including rights fees, variable production expenses, and advertising sales commissions. MSG Networks aired full regular season telecast schedules in Fiscal Year 2022 and Fiscal Year 2023 for its five professional teams across both the NBA and NHL, and, as a result, its advertising revenue and certain operating expenses, including rights fees expense, reflect the same.\nIt is unclear to what extent pandemic concerns, including with respect to COVID-19 or other future pandemics, could (i) result in new government-mandated capacity or other restrictions or vaccination/mask requirements or impact the use of and/or demand for Sphere in Las Vegas, impact demand for the Company\u2019s sponsorship and advertising assets, deter employees and vendors from working at Sphere in Las Vegas (which may lead to difficulties in staffing), deter artists from touring or (ii) result in professional sports leagues suspending, cancelling or otherwise reducing the number of games scheduled in the regular reason or playoffs, which could have a material impact on the distribution and/or advertising revenues of the MSG Networks segment, or otherwise materially impact our operations. \nFor more information about the risks to the Company as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operating results, see \u201cPart I \u2014 Item 1A. Risk Factors \u2014 Operational and Economic Risks\u2014\nOur Operations and Operating Results Were Materially Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Actions Taken in Response by Governmental Authorities and Certain Professional Sports Leagues, and a Resurgence of the COVID-19 Pandemic or Another Pandemic or Public Health Emergency Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations\n.\u201d\nIn addition to the above items, the MSGE Distribution and Tao Group Hospitality Disposition both qualified for discontinued operations presentation under GAAP during Fiscal Year 2023. As such, the Company\u2019s historical results for all periods presented have been recast to exclude the operations of each disposed business.  See below for further discussion.\n44\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Fiscal Year Ended June\u00a030, 2023 versus the Fiscal Year Ended June\u00a030, 2022\nConsolidated R\nesults of Operations\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information.\n\u00a0 \nYears Ended June 30,\nChange\n2023\n2022\nAmount\nPercentage\nRevenues\n$\n573,831\u00a0\n$\n610,055\u00a0\n$\n(36,224)\n(6)\n%\nDirect operating expenses\n(342,211)\n(320,278)\n(21,933)\n7\u00a0\n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses \n(452,142)\n(419,793)\n(32,349)\n8\u00a0\n%\nDepreciation and amortization \n(30,716)\n(22,562)\n(8,154)\n36\u00a0\n%\nImpairment and other gains, net\n6,120\u00a0\n245\u00a0\n5,875\u00a0\nNM\nRestructuring charges\n(27,924)\n(13,404)\n(14,520)\n108\u00a0\n%\nOperating loss\n(273,042)\n(165,737)\n(107,305)\n65\u00a0\n%\nInterest income\n11,585\u00a0\n3,575\u00a0\n8,010\u00a0\nNM\nOther income (expense), net\n536,887\u00a0\n(5,518)\n542,405\u00a0\nNM\nIncome (loss) from operations before income taxes\n275,430\u00a0\n(167,680)\n443,110\u00a0\nNM\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n(103,403)\n29,830\u00a0\n(133,233)\nNM\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations\n172,027\u00a0\n(137,850)\n309,877\u00a0\nNM\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes\n333,653\u00a0\n(52,297)\n385,950\u00a0\nNM\nNet income (loss)\n505,680\u00a0\n(190,147)\n695,827\u00a0\nNM\nLess: Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests from discontinued operations\n3,925\u00a0\n7,739\u00a0\n(3,814)\n(49)\n%\nLess: Net loss attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests from discontinued operations\n(1,017)\n(3,491)\n2,474\u00a0\n(71)\n%\nNet income (loss) attributable to Sphere Entertainment Co.\u2019s stockholders\n$\n502,772\u00a0\n$\n(194,395)\n$\n697,167\u00a0\nNM\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNM \u2014 Absolute percentages greater than 200% and comparisons from positive to negative values or to zero values are considered not meaningful.\nFor all periods through the MSGE Distribution, the reported financial results of the Company reflect the results of the MSG Entertainment business, previously owned and operated by the Company through its Sphere segment, as discontinued operations and for all periods through the Tao Group Hospitality Disposition, the reported financial results of the Company reflect the results of the Tao Group Hospitality segment, previously owned and operated by the Company, as discontinued operations. In addition, results from continuing operations for these periods include certain corporate overhead expenses that the Company did not incur in the period after the completion of the MSGE Distribution and does not expect to incur in future periods, but which do not meet the criteria for inclusion in discontinued operations. The reported financial results of the Company for the periods after the MSGE Distribution reflect the Company\u2019s results on a standalone basis, including the Company\u2019s actual corporate overhead.\nThe following is a summary of changes in our segments\u2019 operating results for Fiscal Year 2023 as compared to Fiscal Year 2022, which are discussed below under \u201cBusiness Segment Results.\u201d\nChanges attributable to\nRevenues\nDirect\noperating \nexpenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nDepreciation\nand\namortization\nImpairment and other gains, net\nRestructuring charges\nOperating loss\nSphere segment\n$\n710\u00a0\n$\n(5,545)\n$\n(31,996)\n$\n(10,880)\n$\n5,984\u00a0\n$\n(10,184)\n$\n(51,911)\nMSG Networks segment\n(36,934)\n(16,388)\n(353)\n2,726\u00a0\n(109)\n(4,336)\n(55,394)\n$\n(36,224)\n$\n(21,933)\n$\n(32,349)\n$\n(8,154)\n$\n5,875\u00a0\n$\n(14,520)\n$\n(107,305)\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for Fiscal Year 2023 increased $8,154, or 36%, to $30,716 as compared to Fiscal Year 2022 primarily due to an increase in depreciation of Big Dome, the Company\u2019s creative studio in Burbank, California, due to certain assets being placed in service during Fiscal Year 2023.\n45\nImpairment and other gains, net\nImpairment and other gains, net\n, were $6,120 for Fiscal Year 2023 as compared to $245 for Fiscal Year 2022. The increase in the net gain of $5,875 was primarily due to the receipt of insurance proceeds related to Big Dome, the Company\u2019s creative studio in Burbank, California.\nRestructuring charges\nRestructuring charges \nfor Fiscal Year 2023 increased $14,520, or 108%, to $27,924 as compared to Fiscal Year 2022 primarily due to \ntermination benefits provided for a workforce reduction of certain executives and employees within the Sphere and MSG Networks segments as part of the Company\u2019s cost reduction program implemented in Fiscal Year 2023.\nInterest income\nInterest income \nfor Fiscal Year 2023\n increased $8,010, as compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher interest rates.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net for Fiscal Year 2023, increased $542,405, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to unrealized gains of $341,039 and realized gains of $204,676 associated with the Company\u2019s retained interest in MSG Entertainment.\nIncome taxes\n \nInco\nme tax expense from continuing operations for Fiscal Year 2023 of $103,403 differs from income tax expense derived from applying the statutory federal rate of 21% to the pretax income primarily due to (i) tax expense of $35,656 related to state and local taxes, (ii) tax expense of $4,814 related to nondeductible officers\u2019 compensation, and (iii) tax expense related to excess share based compensation of $4,678, partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance of $2,053.\nIncome tax benefit from continuing operations for Fiscal Year 2022 of $29,830 differs from income tax benefit derived from applying the statutory federal rate of 21% to the pretax loss primarily due to (i) tax expense of $12,759 related to nondeductible officers\u2019 compensation, partially offset by state income tax benefit of $3,970 and a decrease in the valuation allowance of $2,200. \nSee Note \n16. Income Taxes\n to the consolidated financial statements included in Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the components of income tax and a reconciliation of the statutory federal rate to the effective tax rate.\nAdjusted operating income (loss) (\u201cAOI\u201d)\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, of which the key financial measure is adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure. We define adjusted operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) excluding:\n(i) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets,\n(ii) amortization for capitalized cloud computing arrangement costs,\n(iii) share-based compensation expense,\n(iv) restructuring charges or credits,\n(v) merger and acquisition-related costs, including litigation expenses,\n(vi) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses and associated settlements, \n(vii) the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to business acquisitions, and\n(viii)  gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities under the Company\u2019s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.\nSee Note 18. Segment Information to the consolidated financial statements included in Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on the definition of AOI.\nThe Company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the Company\u2019s business without regard to the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash. The Company eliminates merger and acquisition-related costs, when applicable, because the Company does not consider such costs to be indicative of the ongoing operating performance of the Company as they result from an event that is of a non-recurring nature, thereby enhancing comparability. In addition, management believes that the exclusion of gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities under the Company\u2019s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan provides investors with a clearer picture of the Company\u2019s operating performance given that, in accordance with GAAP, gains and losses related to the \n46\nremeasurement of liabilities under the Company\u2019s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan are recognized in Operating income (loss) whereas gains and losses related to the remeasurement of the assets under the Company\u2019s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which are equal to and therefore fully offset the gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities, are recognized in Other income (expense), net, which is not reflected in Operating income (loss).\nThe Company believes AOI is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of its business segments and the Company on a consolidated basis. AOI and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors and analysts to analyze the Company\u2019s performance. The Company uses revenues and AOI measures as the most important indicators of its business performance, and evaluates management\u2019s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.\nAOI should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Since AOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. The Company has presented the components that reconcile operating income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to AOI.\nThe following is a reconciliation of operating loss to adjusted operating loss: \nYears Ended June 30,\nChange\n2023\n2022\nAmount\nPercentage\nOperating loss\n$\n(273,042)\n$\n(165,737)\n$\n(107,305)\n65\u00a0\n%\nShare-based compensation\n(a)\n42,607\u00a0\n56,760\u00a0\n(14,153)\nDepreciation and amortization\n30,716\u00a0\n22,562\u00a0\n8,154\u00a0\nRestructuring charges\n27,924\u00a0\n13,404\u00a0\n14,520\u00a0\nImpairment and other gains, net\n(6,120)\n(245)\n(5,875)\nMerger and acquisition related costs\n55,047\u00a0\n48,517\u00a0\n6,530\u00a0\nAmortization for capitalized cloud computing costs\n161\u00a0\n271\u00a0\n(110)\nRemeasurement of deferred compensation plan liabilities\n187\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n187\u00a0\nAdjusted operating loss\n$\n(122,520)\n$\n(24,468)\n$\n(98,052)\nNM\n________________\nNM \u2014 Absolute percentages greater than 200% and comparisons from positive to negative values or to zero values are considered not meaningful.\n(a)\nFor periods through the MSGE Distribution, share-based compensation includes expenses related to corporate employees that the Company does not expect to incur in future periods, but which do not meet the criteria for inclusion in discontinued operations\n.\n \n \nAdjusted operating loss for Fiscal Year 2023 increased $98,052 to $122,520 as compared to Fiscal Year 2022.

The net increase was attributable to the full year impact of sublease rental income of office space in San Francisco, California, that the Company subleased to a third-party after relocating certain operations to Burbank, California. \nDirect operating expenses\nDirect operating expenses increased $5,545 from $0 for Fiscal Year 2022 to $5,545 for Fiscal Year 2023. The net increase was primarily attributable to advertising and marketing costs related to the opening of Sphere in Las Vegas.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $31,996, or 11%, for Fiscal Year 2023 to $325,660 as compared to Fiscal Year 2022. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the MSGE TSA, higher employee compensation and related benefits and other cost increases.\n \nThe overall increase was partially offset by the absence of certain corporate expenses that were included in the segment results for the entire prior year but were only included in the results for the pre-MSGE Distribution period (July 1, 2022 through April 20, 2023) in Fiscal Year 2023.\n \nWhile the Company did not incur these corporate costs after the MSGE Distribution Date and does not expect to incur these corporate costs in Fiscal Year 2024, they did not meet the criteria for inclusion in discontinued operations for all periods prior to the MSGE Distribution Date.\nIn addition, professional fees incurred by the Company decreased, as compared to the prior year, due to the inclusion of litigation-related insurance recoveries received in Fiscal Year 2023 associated with the \nNetworks Merger\n.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for Fiscal Year 2023 increased $10,880, or 83%, to $24,048 as compared to Fiscal Year 2022 \nprimarily due to an increase in depreciation of Big Dome, the Company\u2019s creative studio in Burbank, California, due to certain assets being placed in service during Fiscal Year 2023.\n48\nRestructuring charges\nRestructuring charges \nfor Fiscal Year 2023 increased $10,184, or 79%, to $23,136 as compared to Fiscal Year 2022 primarily due to \ntermination benefits provided for a workforce reduction of certain executives and employees as part of the Company\u2019s cost reduction program implemented in Fiscal Year 2023.\nOperating loss\nOperating loss for Fiscal Year 2023 increased $51,911 to $369,550 as compared to an operating loss of $317,639 in Fiscal Year 2022. The increased operating loss was primarily due to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, higher depreciation and amortization, and an increase in restructuring charges.\nAdjusted operating loss\nAdjusted operating loss for Fiscal Year 2023 increased $61,242 to $292,409 as compared to Fiscal Year 2022. The increased adjusted operating loss was primarily due to the increase in net loss, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses and restructuring charges, both of which are excluded in the calculation of adjusted operating loss.\nMSG Networks\nThe tables below set forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income for the Company\u2019s MSG Networks segment.\u00a0\n \nYears Ended June 30,\nChange\n2023\n2022\nAmount\nPercentage\nRevenues\n$\n571,221\u00a0\n$\n608,155\u00a0\n$\n(36,934)\n(6)\n%\nDirect operating expenses\n(336,666)\n(320,278)\n(16,388)\n5\u00a0\n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n (a)\n(126,482)\n(126,129)\n(353)\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n(6,668)\n(9,394)\n2,726\u00a0\n(29)\n%\nImpairment and other losses, net\n(109)\n\u2014\u00a0\n(109)\nNM\nRestructuring charges\n(4,788)\n(452)\n(4,336)\nNM\nOperating income\n$\n96,508\u00a0\n$\n151,902\u00a0\n$\n(55,394)\n(36)\n%\nReconciliation to adjusted operating income:\nShare-based compensation expense\n6,419\u00a0\n17,092\u00a0\n(10,673)\nDepreciation and amortization\n6,668\u00a0\n9,394\u00a0\n(2,726)\nRestructuring charges\n4,788\u00a0\n452\u00a0\n4,336\u00a0\nImpairment and other losses, net\n109\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n109\u00a0\nMerger and acquisition related costs\n55,236\u00a0\n27,683\u00a0\n27,553\u00a0\nAmortization for capitalized cloud computing costs\n161\u00a0\n176\u00a0\n(15)\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n169,889\u00a0\n$\n206,699\u00a0\n$\n(36,810)\n(18)\n%\n _________________\nNM \u2014 Absolute percentages greater than 200% and comparisons from positive to negative values or to zero values are considered not meaningful.\n(a)\nAs a result of the MSGE Distribution on April 20, 2023 (which is presented as discontinued operations under GAAP), prior period results of the MSG Networks segment have been recast to exclude expenses of approximately $8,800 and $20,900 for Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the MSG Networks\u2019 Advertising Sales Representation Agreement with MSG Entertainment, which was terminated effective as of December 31, 2022. A portion of these expenses were absorbed directly by MSG Networks following the termination of the advertising sales representation agreement and are reflected in MSG Networks\u2019 results beginning January 1, 2023.\nRevenues\nRevenues for Fiscal Year 2023 decreased $36,934, or 6%, to $571,221 as compared to the prior year. The changes in revenues were attributable to the following:\n\u00a0\nYear Ended June 30, 2023\nDecrease in affiliation fee revenue\n$\n(49,302)\nIncrease in advertising revenue\n11,517\u00a0\nOther net increases\n851\u00a0\n$\n(36,934)\n49\nFor Fiscal Year 2023, affiliation fee revenue decreased $49,302, primarily due to a decrease in subscribers of approximately 10.5% (excluding the impact of the non-renewal of MSG Networks\u2019 carriage agreement with Comcast Corporation (\u201cComcast\u201d) as of October 1, 2021) and, to a lesser extent, the impact of the Comcast non-renewal. These decreases were partially offset by net favorable affiliate adjustments of approximately $10,400 and the impact of higher affiliation rates.\nEffective October 1, 2021, Comcast\u2019s license to carry MSG Networks expired and MSG Networks has not been carried by Comcast since that date. Comcast\u2019s non-carriage reduced MSG Networks\u2019 subscribers by approximately 10% and reduced MSG Networks\u2019 revenue by a comparable percentage. In addition, MSG Networks\u2019 segment operating income and AOI were reduced by an amount that is approximately equal to the dollar amount of the reduced revenue.\nFor Fiscal Year 2023, the increase in advertising revenue primarily reflected higher advertising sales related to professional sports telecasts due to the impact of a higher number of live telecasts and an increase in per-game advertising sales as compared with the prior year periods, as well as higher sales related to the Company\u2019s non-ratings-based advertising initiatives.\nDirect operating expenses\nFor Fiscal Year 2023, direct operating expenses increased $16,388, or 5%, to $336,666 as compared to the prior year. The changes were attributable to the following:\nYear Ended June 30, 2023\nIncrease in rights fees expense\n$\n14,610\u00a0\nChange in other programming and production costs\n1,778\u00a0\n$\n16,388\u00a0\nFor Fiscal Year 2023, right fees expense increased $14,610 primarily due to the impact of annual contractual rate increases and due to the absence of reductions in media rights fees related to the shortened 2020-21 NHL season recorded in the prior year first quarter.\nFor Fiscal Year 2023, other programming and production costs increased $1,778 primarily due to a higher number of professional sports telecasts in the current fiscal year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nFor Fiscal Year 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $353, to $126,482 as compared to the prior year \nprimarily due to litigation settlement expenses of $48,500 recognized in the current year related to the Networks Merger, which was partially offset by lower advertising and marketing expenses, lower employee compensation and related benefits, and other cost decreases.\nOperating income\n \nFor Fiscal Year 2023, operating income decreased $55,394, or 36%, to $96,508 as compared to the prior year. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the decrease in revenues, increase in direct operating expenses, and the impact of restructuring charges.\nAdjusted operating income\n \nFor Fiscal Year 2023, adjusted operating income decreased $36,810, or 18%, to $169,889 as compared to the prior year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was lower than the decrease in operating income of $55,394 primarily due to the decrease in revenues and increase in direct operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding the impact of the Networks Merger litigation settlement and restructuring expenses discussed above).\n50\nComparison of

amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for Fiscal Year 2022 increased $5,956, or 36%, to $22,562 as compared to Fiscal Year 2021 primarily due to \n an increase in depreciation of Big Dome, the Company\u2019s creative studio in Burbank, California, due to certain equipment and other assets being placed in service during Fiscal Year 2022.\nRestructuring charges\nRestructuring charges \nfor Fiscal Year 2022 increased $5,343, or 66%, to $13,404 as compared to Fiscal Year 2021 primarily due to \ntermination benefits provided for a workforce reduction of certain executives and employees within the Sphere and MSG Networks segments as part of the Company\u2019s cost reduction program implemented in Fiscal Year 2022.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for Fiscal Year 2022 were nil as compared to Fiscal Year 2021 primarily due to a higher amount of interest expense capitalization related to Sphere construction.\n51\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net\n for Fiscal Year 2022 increased $1,583, or 40% to $5,518 as compared to Fiscal Year 2021 primarily due to the absence of the unrealized gain on equity investment without readily determinable fair value.\nIncome taxes\nIncome tax benefit from continuing operations for Fiscal Year 2022 of $29,830 differs from income tax benefit derived from applying the statutory federal rate of 21% to the pretax loss primarily due to tax expense of $12,759 related to nondeductible officers\u2019 compensation, partially offset by state income tax benefit of $3,970 and a decrease in the valuation allowance of $2,200. \nIncome tax expense for continuing operations for Fiscal Year 2021 of $38,907 differs from income tax expense derived from applying the statutory federal rate of 21% to the

The net increase was attributable to sublease rental income that commenced during Fiscal Year 2022 related to office space in San Francisco, California, that the Company subleased to a third-party after relocating certain operations to Burbank, California.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $99,833, or 52%, for Fiscal Year 2022 to $293,664 as compared to Fiscal Year 2021. The increase was primarily due to (i) a net increase in employee compensation and related benefits, and (ii) higher professional fees inclusive of costs for Sphere development, partially offset by higher reimbursement of corporate costs under the services agreement with MSG Sports in Fiscal Year 2022 as compared to Fiscal Year 2021.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for Fiscal Year 2022 increased $3,897, or 42%, to $13,168 as compared to Fiscal Year 2021 \nprimarily due to an increase in depreciation of Big Dome, the Company\u2019s creative studio in Burbank, California, due to certain equipment and other assets being placed in service during Fiscal Year 2022.\nRestructuring charges\nRestructuring charges \nfor Fiscal Year 2022 increased $4,891, or 61%, to $12,952 as compared to Fiscal Year 2021 primarily due to \ntermination benefits provided for a workforce reduction of certain executives and employees within the Sphere segment as part of the Company\u2019s cost reduction program implemented in Fiscal Year 2022.\nOperating loss\nOperating loss for Fiscal Year 2022 increased $106,476 to $317,639 as compared to an operating loss of $211,163 in June\u00a030, 2021. The increased operating loss was primarily due to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nAdjusted operating loss\nAdjusted operating loss for Fiscal Year 2022 increased $95,535 to $231,167 as compared to Fiscal Year 2021. The increased adjusted operating loss was primarily due to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher merger and acquisition related costs, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses, both of which are excluded in the calculation of adjusted operating loss.\n53\nMSG Networks\nThe tables below set forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income for the Company\u2019s MSG Networks segment.\n\u00a0\nYears Ended June 30,\nChange\n2022\n2021\nAmount\nPercentage\nRevenues\n$\n608,155\u00a0\n$\n647,510\u00a0\n$\n(39,355)\n(6)\n%\nDirect operating expenses\n(320,278)\n(262,859)\n(57,419)\n22\u00a0\n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses \n(a)\n(126,129)\n(101,641)\n(24,488)\n24\u00a0\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n(9,394)\n(7,335)\n(2,059)\n28\u00a0\n%\nRestructuring charges\n(452)\n\u2014\u00a0\n(452)\nNM\nOperating income\n$\n151,902\u00a0\n$\n275,675\u00a0\n$\n(123,773)\n(45)\n%\nReconciliation to adjusted operating income:\nShare-based compensation expense\n17,092\u00a0\n17,667\u00a0\n(575)\nDepreciation and amortization\n9,394\u00a0\n7,335\u00a0\n2,059\u00a0\nRestructuring charges\n452\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n452\u00a0\nMerger and acquisition related costs\n27,683\u00a0\n4,502\u00a0\n23,181\u00a0\nAmortization for capitalized cloud computing costs\n176\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n176\u00a0\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n206,699\u00a0\n$\n305,179\u00a0\n$\n(98,480)\n(32)\n%\n_________________\nNM \u2014 Absolute percentages greater than 200% and comparisons from positive to negative values or to zero values are considered not meaningful.\n(a) \nAs a result of the MSGE Distribution on April 20, 2023 (which is presented as discontinued operations under GAAP), prior period results of the MSG Networks segment have been recast to exclude expenses of approximately $20,900 and $13,700 for Fiscal Years 2022, and 2021, respectively, related to the MSG Networks\u2019 Advertising Sales Representation Agreement with MSG Entertainment, which was terminated effective as of December 31, 2022. A portion of these expenses were absorbed directly by MSG Networks following the termination of the advertising sales representation agreement and are reflected in MSG Networks\u2019 results beginning January 1, 2023.\nRevenues\nRevenues for Fiscal Year 2022 decreased $39,355, or 6%, to $608,155 as compared to the prior year. The changes in revenues were attributable to the following:\n\u00a0\nYear Ended June 30, 2022\nDecrease in affiliation fee revenue\n$\n(67,286)\nIncrease in advertising revenue\n26,310\u00a0\nOther net increases\n1,621\u00a0\n$\n(39,355)\nFor Fiscal Year 2022, the decrease in affiliation fee revenue was primarily due to the impact of (i) the non-renewal of MSG Networks\u2019 carriage agreement with Comcast as of October 1, 2021 and (ii) a decrease in subscribers of approximately 7% (excluding the impact of previously disclosed non-renewals with Comcast and a small Connecticut-based distributor). These decreases were partially offset by the impact of higher affiliation rates and a decrease in net unfavorable affiliate adjustments of approximately $9,400. \nFor Fiscal Year 2022, the increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to the impact of (i) higher per-game advertising sales from the telecast of live professional sports programming, (ii) a greater number of live NBA and NHL telecasts in the current year as compared with the prior year and (iii) increased advertising sales related to the Company\u2019s non-ratings based advertising initiatives. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020-21 NBA and NHL seasons, MSG Networks telecasted fewer NBA and NHL games in the prior year, as compared with a regular NBA and NHL telecast schedule in the current year. \nDirect operating expenses\nFor Fiscal Year 2022, direct operating expenses increased $57,419, or 22%, to $320,278 as compared to the prior year. The increases were primarily due to higher rights fees expenses of $45,024 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in other programming \n54\nand production-related costs of $12,395. The increase in rights fees was primarily due to the net impact of lower media rights fees in the prior year as a result of fewer NBA and NHL games made available for exclusive broadcast by MSG Networks during the shortened 2020-21 NBA and NHL regular seasons, and annual contractual rate increases. The increase in other programming and production-related costs was primarily due to the impact of fewer NBA and NHL regular season games in the prior year, as compared with a regular NBA and NHL telecast schedule in the current year, and expenses related to sports gaming programming, partially offset by other net cost decreases.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nFor Fiscal Year 2022, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $24,488, or 24%, to $126,129 as compared to the prior year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses reflected an increase of approximately $24,900 of merger and acquisition costs that occurred in Fiscal Year 2022, inclusive of the impact of executive separation agreements and share based compensation expense. In addition, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to higher advertising, and marketing expenses of approximately $3,100. These increases were partially offset by lower employee compensation and related benefits (including share based compensation expense) of $5,600.\nOperating income\n \nFor Fiscal Year 2022, operating income decreased $123,773, or 45%, to $151,902 as compared to the prior year. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the increase in direct operating expenses, the decrease in revenues, and to a lesser extent, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nAdjusted operating income\n \nFor Fiscal Year 2022, adjusted operating income decreased $98,480, or 32%, to $206,699 as compared to the prior year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was lower than the decrease in operating income of $130,953 primarily due to the increase in merger and acquisition-related costs of approximately $25,000, which are excluded in the calculation of adjusted operating income. \n55\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nSources and Uses of Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from the operations of our businesses, as well as any proceeds from the sale of the MSGE Retained Interest. Our uses of cash over the next 18 months are expected to be substantial and include working capital-related items (including funding our operations), capital spending (including completing construction of Sphere in Las Vegas and related original content, as described below), debt service and payments we expect to make in connection with the refinancing of our indebtedness, and investments and related loans and advances that we may fund from time to time. We may also use cash to repurchase our common stock. Our decisions as to the use of our available liquidity will be based upon the ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, the optimal allocation of cash resources, and the timing of cash flow generation. To the extent that we desire to access alternative sources of funding through the capital and credit markets, market conditions could adversely impact our ability to do so at that time.\nWe regularly monitor and assess our ability to meet our net funding and investing requirements, including completing the construction of Sphere in Las Vegas and the refinancing of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities prior to their maturity in October 2024. The Company\u2019s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance as of June 30, 2023 was $131,965, and was $747,313 as of June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, the Company\u2019s restricted cash and cash equivalents balance was approximately $297,000, inclusive of $275,000, which was required to be held in an account pledged as collateral for the LV Sphere Term Loan Facility until its release upon the Liquidity Covenant Reduction Date (as defined below). The Liquidity Covenant Reduction Date occurred on August\u00a08, 2023.  Additionally, on July\u00a014, 2023, we borrowed the full $65,000 amount available under the DDTL Facility and subsequently, on August 9, 2023, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the DDTL Facility using a portion of the MSGE Retained Interest. The Company\u2019s unrestricted and restricted cash and cash equivalents balance as of August 18, 2023 wa\ns $341,489 and $39,179, respectively.\nThe principal balance of the Company\u2019s total debt outstanding as of June 30, 2023 was $1,207,250. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity from cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations (including expected cash from operations from Sphere in Las Vegas), as well as any proceeds from the sale of the MSGE Retained Interest (which had an aggregate fair market value of approximately $270,000 as of August 18, 2023), to fund our operations and service the credit facilities for the foreseeable future, as well as to complete the construction of\n Sphere in Las Vegas. This also includes the Company\u2019s expectation that it will pay down a portion of MSG Networks\u2019 term loan upon the refinancing of the loan prior to its maturity in October 2024. There can be no assurances that we will be able to dispose of all or a portion of the remainder of the MSGE Retained Interest on favorable terms due to market conditions or otherwise. \nOur ability to have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, including the creation of content, and refinance the MSG Networks Credit Facilities is dependent on the ability of Sphere in Las Vegas to generate significant positive cash flow during Fiscal Year 2024. Although we anticipate that Sphere in Las Vegas will generate substantial revenue and adjusted operating income on an annual basis, there can be no assurances that guests, artists, promoters, advertisers and marketing partners will embrace this new platform.  Original immersive productions, such as \nPostcard From Earth\n, have not been previously pursued on the scale that we are planning for, which increases the uncertainty of our operating expectations. To the extent that our efforts do not result in a viable show or attraction, or to the extent that any such productions do not achieve expected levels of popularity among audiences, we may not generate the cash flows from operations necessary to fund our operations.\nTo the extent we do not realize expected cash flow from operations from Sphere in Las Vegas, we would have to take several actions to improve our financial flexibility and preserve liquidity, including significant reductions in both labor and non-labor expenses as well as reductions and/or deferrals in capital spending.  \nOur liquidity plans assume that we will pay down a portion of MSG Networks\u2019 term loan upon the refinancing of the loan.  There can be no assurances that our lenders will refinance the MSG Networks\u2019 term loan on those terms, particularly if the declines in operating income and adjusted operating income at MSG Networks continue.  We may not have sufficient liquidity to pay down a higher amount in connection with the refinancing.  If we are not able to refinance the MSG Networks\u2019 term loan prior to its maturity in October 2024, a default thereunder would be triggered, resulting in an acceleration of outstanding debt thereunder and potentially a foreclosure upon the MSG Networks business.\nTo the extent that the MSGE Retained Interest is not used to provide liquidity, the MSGE Retained Interest may be exchanged for our shares and/or distributed pro rata to our stockholders.\nSee Note 12. Credit Facilities to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities, the LV Sphere Term Loan Facility and the DDTL Facility.\n56\nFor additional information regarding the Company\u2019s capital expenditures, including those related to Sphere in Las Vegas, see Note 18.\u00a0Segment Information  to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $350,000 of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock. The program was re-authorized by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors on March 29, 2023. Under the authorization, shares of Class A Common Stock may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. The timing and amount of purchases will depend on market conditions and other factors. No shares have been repurchased under the share repurchase program to date.\nSphere\nThe Company is completing construction of its first state-of-the-art entertainment venue in Las Vegas. See \u201cPart I \u2014 Item\u00a01. Business\u2014Our Business \u2014Sphere \u201d in this Form 10-K. The Company expects the venue to have a number of significant revenue streams, including a wide variety of content such as original immersive productions, advertising and marketing partnerships, concert residencies and marquee sporting and corporate events. As a result, we anticipate that Sphere in Las Vegas will generate substantial revenue and adjusted operating income on an annual basis.\nThe Company expects to open the venue in September 2023. As with any major construction project, the construction of Sphere is subject to potential delays and unexpected complications.\nAs of the date of this filing, we estimate that the final project construction costs, inclusive of core technology and soft costs, for Sphere in Las Vegas will be approximately $2,300,000. This cost estimate is net of \n$75,000\n that The Venetian has agreed to pay to defray certain construction costs. Relative to our cost estimate above, our actual construction costs for Sphere in Las Vegas paid through August 18, 2023 were approximately $2,250,000, which is net of \n$65,000\n received from The Venetian. Both the estimated and actual construction costs exclude significant capitalized and non-capitalized costs for items such as content creation, internal labor, capitalized interest, and furniture and equipment.\nWith regard to Sphere in Las Vegas, the Company plans to finance the completion of the construction of the venue from cash-on-hand and cash flows from operations. \nIn February 2018, we announced the purchase of land in Stratford, London, which we expect will become home to a future Sphere. The Company submitted planning applications to the local planning authority in March 2019 and that process, which requires various stages of review to be completed and approvals to be granted, is ongoing. Therefore, we do not have a definitive timeline at this time.\nWe will continue to explore additional domestic and international markets where we believe next-generation venues such as Sphere can be successful. The Company\u2019s intention for any future venues is to utilize several options, such as joint ventures, equity partners, a managed venue model and non-recourse debt financing.\nFinancing Agreements\nSee Note\u00a012. Credit Facilities to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussions of the Company\u2019s debt obligations and various financing arrangements. \nMSG Networks Senior Secured Credit Facility\nMSGN L.P., MSGN Eden, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of the Company (through the Networks Merger) and the general partner of MSGN L.P., Regional MSGN Holdings LLC, an indirect subsidiary of the Company and the limited partner of MSGN L.P. (collectively with MSGN Eden, LLC, the \u201cMSGN Holdings Entities\u201d), and certain subsidiaries of MSGN L.P. have senior secured credit facilities pursuant to a credit agreement (as amended and restated on October 11, 2019, the \u201cMSGN Credit Agreement\u201d) consisting of: (i) an initia\nl $1,100,000 term l\noan facility (the \u201cMSGN Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (\nii) a $250,000 \nrevolving credit facility (the \u201cMSGN Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), each with a term of five years. As of June\u00a030, 2023, there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued and outstanding under the MSGN Revolving Credit Facility. \nThe MSGN Term Loan Facility amortizes quarterly in accordance with its terms beginning March 31, 2020 through September 30, 2024 with a final maturity date of October 11, 2024. MSGN L.P. is required to make mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances, including without limitation from the net cash proceeds of certain sales of assets (including MSGN Collateral) or casualty insurance and/or condemnation recoveries (subject to certain reinvestment, repair or replacement rights) and the incurrence of certain indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions.\n57\nThe MSGN Credit Agreement generally requires the MSGN Holdings Entities and MSGN L.P. and its restricted subsidiaries on a c\nonsolidated basis to comply with a maximum total leverage ratio of 5.50:1.00, subject, at the option of MSGN L.P. to an upward adjustment to 6.00:1.00 during the continuance of certain events. In addition, the MSGN Credit Agreement requires a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.00:1.00 for the MSGN Holdings Entities and MSGN L.P. and its restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. \nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, the MSGN Holdings Entities and MSGN L.P. and its restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis were in compliance with the covenants. \nSee Note 12. Credit Facilities to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information such as repayments of $66,000 made in Fiscal Year 2023 and scheduled repayment requirement of $82,500 in Fiscal Year 2024 on the MSG Networks Term Loan.\nLV Sphere Term Loan Facility\nOn December 22, 2022, MSG Las Vegas, LLC (\u201cMSG LV\u201d), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto, providing for a five-year, $275,000 senior secured term loan facility (the \u201cLV Sphere Term Loan Facility\u201d). All obligations under the LV Sphere Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by Sphere Entertainment Group, LLC (\u201cSphere Entertainment Group\u201d).\nThe LV Sphere Term Loan Facility will mature on December 22, 2027. The principal obligations under the LV Sphere Term Loan Facility are due at the maturity of the facility, with no amortization payments prior to maturity. Under certain circumstances, MSG LV is required to make mandatory prepayments on the loan, including prepayments in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of casualty insurance and/or condemnation recoveries (subject to certain reinvestment, repair or replacement rights), subject to certain exceptions.\nThe LV Sphere Term Loan Facility and related guaranty by Sphere Entertainment Group include financial covenants requiring MSG LV to maintain a specified minimum debt service coverage ratio and requiring Sphere Entertainment Group to maintain a specified minimum liquidity level. The debt service coverage ratio covenant begins testing in the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023 on a historical basis and, beginning with the first fiscal quarter occurring after the date on which the first ticketed performance or event open to the general public occurs at Sphere in Las Vegas, is also tested on a prospective basis. Both the historical and prospective debt service coverage ratios are set at 1.35:1. In addition, among other conditions, MSG LV is not permitted to make distributions to Sphere Entertainment Group unless the historical and prospective debt service coverage ratios are at least 1.50:1. Following the Liquidity Covenant Reduction Date (as defined below), the minimum liquidity level for Sphere Entertainment Group is set at $50,000, with $25,000 required to be held in cash or cash equivalents. Prior to the Liquidity Covenant Reduction Date, the minimum liquidity level was $100,000 with $75,000 required to be held in cash or cash equivalents, which amounts (in addition to certain cash proceeds from the sale of the MSGE Retained Interest) were required to be held in an account pledged as collateral for the LV Sphere Term Loan Facility until its release upon the Liquidity Covenant Reduction Date. The Liquidity Covenant Reduction Date occurred on August 8, 2023, once Sphere in Las Vegas was substantially completed and certain of its systems were ready to be used in live, immersive events (the \u201cLiquidity Covenant Reduction Date\u201d). The minimum liquidity level was tested on the closing date and is tested as of the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter based on Sphere Entertainment Group\u2019s unencumbered liquidity, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and available lines of credit, as of such date. Following the completion of the MSGE Distribution, the MSGE Retained Interest was pledged to secure the LV Sphere Term Loan Facility and was released as collateral upon the Liquidity Covenant Reduction Date. A portion of the value of the MSGE Retained Interest may also be counted toward the minimum liquidity level.\nLetters of Credit\nThe Company uses letters of credit to support its business operations. As of June\u00a030, 2023, there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued and outstanding under the MSGN Revolving Credit Facility. The Company has letters of credit relating to operating leases which are supported by cash and cash equivalents that are classified as restricted.\n58\nCash Flow Discussion \nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $429,114, as compared to $760,312 as of June\u00a030, 2022 and $1,190,105 as of June\u00a030, 2021.

Business \u2014 Our Business \u2014 Sphere\n.\n\u201d\nSeasonality of Our Business\nOur MSG Networks segment generally earns a higher share of its annual revenues in the second and third quarters of its fiscal year as a result of MSG Networks\u2019 advertising revenue being largely derived from the sale of inventory in its live NBA and NHL professional sports programming.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Estimates\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements \nSee Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nto the consolidated financial statements included in Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\n for discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates \nCritical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nThe preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Management believes its use of estimates in the consolidated financial statements to be reasonable. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\nRevenue Recognition - Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nThe Company may enter into arrangements with multiple performance obligations, such as multi-year sponsorship agreements which may derive revenues for the Company as well as MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports within a single arrangement. The Company may also derive revenue from similar types of arrangements which are entered into by MSG Entertainment or MSG Sports. Payment terms for such arrangements can vary by contract, but payments are generally due in installments throughout the contractual term. The performance obligations included in each sponsorship agreement vary and may include advertising and \n60\nother benefits such as, but not limited to, signage at Sphere, digital advertising, event or property specific advertising, as well as non-advertising benefits such as suite licenses and event tickets. To the extent the Company\u2019s multi-year arrangements provide for performance obligations that are consistent over the multi-year contractual term, such performance obligations generally meet the definition of a series as provided for under the accounting guidance. If performance obligations are concluded to meet the definition of a series, the contractual fees for all years during the contract term are aggregated and the related revenue is recognized proportionately as the underlying performance obligations are satisfied.\nThe timing of revenue recognition for each performance obligation is dependent upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the Company\u2019s satisfaction of its respective performance obligation. The Company allocates the transaction price for such arrangements to each performance obligation within the arrangement based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of the performance obligation. The Company\u2019s process for determining its estimated standalone selling prices involves management\u2019s judgment and considers multiple factors including company specific and market specific factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation. Key factors considered by the Company in developing an estimated standalone selling price for its performance obligations include, but are not limited to, prices charged for similar performance obligations, the Company\u2019s ongoing pricing strategy and policies, and consideration of pricing of similar performance obligations sold in other arrangements with multiple performance obligations.\nThe Company may incur costs such as commissions to obtain its multi-year sponsorship agreements. The Company assesses such costs for capitalization on a contract by contract basis. To the extent costs are capitalized, the Company estimates the useful life of the related contract asset which may be the underlying contract term or the estimated customer life depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the contract. The contract asset is amortized over the estimated useful life.  \nImpairment of Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets\nThe Company\u2019s long-lived and indefinite-lived assets accounted for approximately 78% of the Company\u2019s consolidated total assets as of June\u00a030, 2023 and consisted of the following:\nGoodwill\n$\n456,807\u00a0\nIntangible assets, net\n17,910\u00a0\nProperty and equipment, net\n3,307,161\u00a0\nRight-of-use lease assets\n84,912\u00a0\n$\n3,866,790\u00a0\nIn assessing the recoverability of the Company\u2019s long-lived and indefinite-lived assets when there is an indicator of potential impairment, the Company must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized as well as the magnitude of any such charge. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve significant uncertainties and judgments and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges related to its long-lived and/or indefinite-lived assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment as of August\u00a031\nst\n and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The Company performs its goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level. As of June\u00a030, 2023, the Company has two reportable segments and two reporting units, Sphere and MSG Networks, consistent with the way management makes decisions and allocates resources to the business. \nThe goodwill balance reported on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of June\u00a030, 2023 by reportable segment was as follows:\nSphere\n$\n32,299\u00a0\nMSG Networks\n424,508\u00a0\n$\n456,807\u00a0\nThe Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If the Company can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would not need to perform a quantitative impairment test for that reporting unit. If the Company cannot support such a conclusion or the Company does not elect to perform the qualitative assessment, the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. \n61\nThe estimates of the fair values of the Company\u2019s reporting units are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, comparable market transactions or other acceptable valuation techniques, including the cost approach. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rates, cost-based assumptions, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. Significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the selection of the appropriate discount rate, the estimate of the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and identification of appropriate continuing growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in the analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows. The amount of an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. \nThe Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment of impairment for all of the Company\u2019s reporting units for the Fiscal Year 2023 annual impairment test. These assessments considered factors such as:\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic conditions;\n\u2022\nindustry and market considerations;\n\u2022\ncost factors;\n\u2022\noverall financial performance of the reporting unit;\n\u2022\nother relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; and\n\u2022\nrelevant reporting unit specific events such as changes in the carrying amount of net assets.\nDuring the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, the Company performed its most recent annual impairment test of goodwill for the MSG Networks reporting unit and determined that there were no impairments of goodwill as of the impairment test date. Based on the impairment test, the Company\u2019s MSG Networks reporting unit had a sufficient safety margin, representing the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, derived from the most recent quantitative assessment, less its carrying value (including goodwill allocated to the reporting unit). The Company believes that if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%, a sufficient safety margin has been realized.\nFor periods prior to the MSGE Distribution, including at the date of the annual goodwill impairment test, Sphere was included with the MSG Entertainment business in a combined reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.  No impairment of goodwill was identified for this reporting unit as of the annual impairment test date.  In connection with the MSGE Distribution, the goodwill balance associated with this reporting unit was allocated between MSG Entertainment discontinued operations and Sphere based upon a relative fair value approach, resulting in $32,299 of goodwill attributed to Sphere. Goodwill attributed to the MSG Entertainment business is included in the carrying value of MSG Entertainment discontinued operations.\nOther Long-Lived Assets\nFor other long-lived assets, including right-of-use lease assets and intangible assets that are amortized, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indication of potential impairment.  Amortizable intangible assets and other long-lived assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from cash flows from other assets and liabilities. In determining whether an impairment of long-lived assets has occurred, the Company considers both qualitative and quantitative factors. The quantitative analysis involves estimating the undiscounted future cash flows directly related to that asset group and comparing the resulting value against the carrying value of the asset group. If the carrying value of the asset group is greater than the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its estimated fair value.\nThe Company has recognized intangible assets for affiliate relationships as a result of purchase accounting, and has determined that these intangible assets have finite lives. The estimated useful lives and net carrying values of the Company\u2019s intangible assets subject to amortization as of June\u00a030, 2023 were as follows:\nEstimated\nUseful Lives\nNet Carrying\n Value\nAffiliate relationships\n24 years\n$\n17,910\u00a0\nThe useful lives of the Company\u2019s long-lived assets are based on estimates of the period over which the Company expects the assets to be of economic benefit to the Company. In estimating the useful lives, the Company considers factors such as, but not limited to, risk of obsolescence, anticipated use, plans of the Company, and applicable laws. In light of these facts and circumstances, the Company has determined that its estimated useful lives are appropriate. \n62",
    "item7a": ">Item\u00a07A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nPotential Interest Rate Risk Exposure:\nThe Company, through its subsidiaries, MSG LV and MSG Networks, is subject to potential interest rate risk exposure related to borrowings incurred under their respective credit facilities. Changes in interest rates may increase interest expense payments with respect to any borrowings incurred under these credit facilities. The effect of a hypothetical 200 basis point increase in floating interest rate prevailing as of June\u00a030, 2023 and continuing for a full year would increase the Company\u2019s interest expense on the outstanding amounts under the credit facilities by $24,145.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Exposure:\nThe Company is exposed to market risk resulting from foreign currency fluctuations, primarily to the British pound sterling through the land we own in London for future Sphere development and through cash and invested funds which will be deployed in the construction of our London venue. We may evaluate and decide, to the extent reasonable and practical, to reduce the translation risk of foreign currency fluctuations by entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions. If we were to enter into such hedging transactions, the market risk resulting from foreign currency fluctuations is unlikely to be entirely eliminated. We do not plan to enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for foreign currency speculative purposes. \nDuring Fiscal Year 2023, the GBP/USD exchange rate ranged from 1.0695 to 1.2835 as compared to GBP/USD exchange rate of 1.2719 as of June\u00a030, 2023, a fluctuation of ranging from 1% to 20%. As of June\u00a030, 2023, a uniform hypothetical 10% fluctuation in the GBP/USD exchange rate would have resulted in a change of $17,686 in the Company\u2019s net asset value. \nDefined Benefit Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan:\n \nThe Company utilizes actuarial methods to calculate pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related net periodic benefit cost which are based on actuarial assumptions. Key assumptions, the discount rates and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, are important elements of the plans\u2019 expense and liability measurement and we evaluate these key assumptions annually. Other assumptions include demographic factors, such as mortality, retirement age and turnover. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to various factors, including, but not limited to, changing economic and market conditions. Differences between actual and expected occurrences could significantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and the benefit obligation recorded by the Company. Material changes in the costs of the plans may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions, changes in the number of the plan participants, changes in the level of benefits provided, changes in asset levels and changes in legislation. Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best estimate regarding future expectations.\nAccumulated and projected benefit obligations reflect the present value of future cash payments for benefits. We use the Willis Towers Watson U.S. Rate Link: 40-90 Discount Rate Model (which is developed by examining the yields on selected highly rated corporate bonds) to discount these benefit payments on a plan by plan basis, to select a rate at which we believe each plan\u2019s benefits could be effectively settled. Additionally, the Company measures service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans\u2019 liability cash flows (\u201cSpot Rate Approach\u201d). The Company believes the Spot Rate Approach provides a more accurate measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. \nLower discount rates increase the present value of benefit obligations and will usually increase the subsequent year\u2019s net periodic benefit cost. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine benefit obligations as of June\u00a030, 2023 for the Company\u2019s Pension Plans and Postretirement Plan were 5.34% and 5.41%, respectively. A 25 basis point decrease in each of these assumed discount rates would increase the projected benefit obligations for the Company\u2019s Pension Plans and Postretirement Plan at June\u00a030, 2023 by $890 and $30, respectively. \nThe weighted-average discount rates used to determine service cost, interest cost and the projected benefit obligation components of net periodic benefit cost were 5.06%, 4.55% and 4.81%, respectively, for Fiscal Year 2023 for the Company\u2019s Pension Plans. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine service cost, interest cost and the projected benefit obligation components of net periodic benefit cost were 4.89%, 4.38% and 4.66%, respectively, for Fiscal Year 2023 for the Company\u2019s Postretirement Plan. A 25 basis point decrease in these assumed discount rates would increase the total net periodic benefit cost for the Company\u2019s Pension Plans by $40 and would result in no impact to the net periodic benefit cost for the Company\u2019s Postretirement Plan for Fiscal Year 2023.\nThe expected long-term return on plan assets is based on a periodic review and modeling of the plans\u2019 asset allocation structures over a long-term horizon. Expectations of returns for each asset class are the most important of the assumptions used in the review and modeling, and are based on comprehensive reviews of historical data, forward-looking economic outlook, and economic/\n63\nfinancial market theory. The expected long-term rate of return was selected from within the reasonable range of rates determined by (a)\u00a0historical real returns, net of inflation, for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, and (b)\u00a0projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Company\u2019s funded pension plans was 5.00% for Fiscal Year 2023.\nPerformance of the capital markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Company\u2019s funded plans. Adverse market performance in the future could result in lower rates of return for these assets than projected by the Company which could increase the Company\u2019s funding requirements related to these plans, as well as negatively affect the Company\u2019s operating results by increasing the net periodic benefit cost. A 25 basis point decrease in the long-term return on pension plan assets assumption would increase net periodic pension benefit cost by $50 for Fiscal Year 2023.\nItem\u00a08.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAn evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of June\u00a030, 2023 the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. \nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in\n Intern\nal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\u00a0 Based on the results of this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June\u00a030, 2023. The e\nffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended June\u00a030, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nItem\u00a09B.
