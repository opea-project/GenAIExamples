    "item1": ">Item 1.\u00a0 Business\nGeneral\nRiverview Bancorp, Inc., a Washington corporation, is the bank holding company of Riverview Bank. At March 31, 2023, the Company had total assets of $1.6 billion, total deposits of $1.3 billion and total shareholders\u2019 equity of $155.2 million. The Company\u2019s executive offices are located in Vancouver, Washington. The Bank has two subsidiaries Riverview Trust Company (the \u201cTrust Company\u201d) and Riverview Services, Inc. (\u201cRiverview Services\u201d). The Trust Company is a trust and financial services company located in downtown Vancouver, Washington, and provides full-service brokerage activities, trust and asset management services. Riverview Services acts as a trustee for deeds of trust on mortgage loans granted by the Bank and receives a reconveyance fee for each deed of trust.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s business is conducted through the Bank, which until April 28, 2021, was a federal savings bank subject to extensive regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d). The Bank converted from a federally chartered savings bank to a Washington state-chartered commercial bank on April 28, 2021.\u00a0As a Washington state-chartered commercial bank, the Bank\u2019s regulators are the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (\u201cWDFI\u201d) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d), the insurer of its deposits. The Bank\u2019s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) remains the primary federal regulator for the Company. In connection with the Bank\u2019s charter conversion, the Company converted from a Savings and Loan Holding Company to a Bank Holding Company. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (\u201cFHLB\u201d) which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System (\u201cFHLB System\u201d).\nAs a progressive, community-oriented financial services company, the Company emphasizes local, personal service to residents of its primary market area. The Company considers Clark, Klickitat and Skamania counties of Washington, and Multnomah, Washington and Marion counties of Oregon as its primary market area. The Company is engaged predominantly in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using such funds in its primary market area to originate commercial business, commercial real estate, multi-family real estate, land, real estate construction, residential real estate and other consumer loans. The Company\u2019s loans receivable, net, totaled $993.5 million at March 31, 2023 compared to $975.9 million at March 31, 2022.\nThe Company\u2019s strategic plan includes targeting the commercial banking customer base in its primary market area for loan originations and deposit growth, specifically small and medium size businesses, professionals and wealth building individuals. In pursuit of these goals, the Company will seek to increase the loan portfolio consistent with its strategic plan and asset/liability and regulatory capital objectives, which includes maintaining a significant amount of commercial business and commercial real estate loans in its loan portfolio which typically carry adjustable rates, higher yields and shorter terms, as well as higher credit risk, compared to traditional fixed-rate consumer real estate one-to-four family loans.\nOur strategic plan also stresses increased emphasis on non-interest income, including increased fees for asset management through the Trust Company and deposit service charges. The strategic plan is designed to enhance earnings, reduce interest rate risk and provide a more complete range of financial services to customers and the local communities the Company serves. We believe we are well positioned to attract new customers and to increase our market share through our \n17 branch locations, including, among others, 10 in Clark County, three in the Portland metropolitan area and three lending centers.\n\u200b\n4\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMarket Area\nThe Company conducts operations from its home office in Vancouver, Washington and 17 branch offices located in Camas, Washougal, Stevenson, White Salmon, Battle Ground, Goldendale, Ridgefield and Vancouver, Washington (six branch offices), and Portland, Gresham, Tualatin and Aumsville, Oregon. The Trust Company has two locations, one in downtown Vancouver, Washington and one in Lake Oswego, Oregon, providing full-service brokerage activities, trust and asset management services. Riverview Mortgage, a mortgage broker division of the Bank, originates mortgage loans for various mortgage companies predominantly in the Vancouver/Portland metropolitan areas, as well as for the Bank. The Bank\u2019s Business and Professional Banking Division, with two lending offices located in Vancouver and one in Portland, offers commercial and business banking services.\nVancouver is located in Clark County, Washington, which is just north of Portland, Oregon. Many businesses are located in the Vancouver area because of the favorable tax structure and lower energy costs in Washington as compared to Oregon. Companies located in the Vancouver area include: Sharp Microelectronics, Hewlett Packard, Georgia Pacific, Underwriters Laboratory, WaferTech, Nautilus, Barrett Business Services, PeaceHealth and Banfield Pet Hospitals, as well as several support industries. In addition to this industry base, the Columbia River Gorge Scenic Area and the Portland metropolitan area are sources of tourism.\nLending Activities\nGeneral\n.\u00a0 At March 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s net loans receivable totaled $993.5 million, or 62.5% of total assets at that date. The principal lending activity of the Company is the origination of loans collateralized by commercial properties and commercial business loans. A substantial portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real estate, either as primary or secondary collateral, located in its primary market area. The Company\u2019s lending activities are subject to the written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) and management. The customary sources of loan originations are realtors, walk-in customers, referrals and existing customers. The Bank also uses commissioned loan brokers and print advertising to market its products and services. Loans are approved at various levels of management, depending upon the amount of the loan. Our current loan policy generally limits the maximum amount of loans we can make to one borrower to the greater of $500,000 or 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus (except for loans fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral, in which case this limit is increased to 25% of unimpaired capital and surplus). The regulatory limit of loans we can make to one borrower is 20% of total risk-based capital, or $36.4 million, at March\u00a031, 2023. At this date, the Bank\u2019s largest lending relationship with one borrower was $29.5 million, which consisted of a multi-family loan of $17.6 million and a commercial real estate loan of $11.9 million, both of which were performing in accordance with their original payment terms at March 31, 2023.\nLoan Portfolio Analysis\n.\u00a0 The following table sets forth the composition of the

of total loans. Commercial business loans are typically secured by business equipment, accounts receivable, inventory or other property. The Company\u2019s commercial business loans may be structured as term loans or as lines of credit. Commercial term loans are generally made to finance the purchase of assets and usually have maturities of five years or less. Commercial lines of credit are typically made for the purpose of providing working capital and usually have a term of one year or less. Lines of credit are made at variable rates of interest equal to a negotiated margin above an index rate and term loans are at either a variable or fixed rate. The Company also generally obtains personal guarantees from financially capable parties based on a review of personal financial statements.\nCommercial business lending typically involves risks that are different from those associated with residential and commercial real estate lending. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories may be obsolete or of limited use, among other things. Accordingly, the repayment of commercial business loans depends primarily on the cash flow and credit-worthiness of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Additionally, the borrower\u2019s cash flow may be unpredictable and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value.\n\u200b\n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOther Real Estate Mortgage Lending.\n The Company originates other real estate mortgage loans secured by office buildings, warehouse/industrial, retail, assisted living facilities and single-purpose facilities (collectively \u201ccommercial real estate loans\u201d or \u201cCRE\u201d) and land and multi-family loans primarily located in its market area, collectively referred to herein as the \u201cother real estate mortgage loan portfolio\u201d. At March 31, 2023, the other real estate mortgage loan portfolio totaled $564.5 million, or 56.0% of total loans. At March 31, 2023, owner occupied properties accounted for 27.8% and non-owner occupied properties accounted for 72.2% of the Company\u2019s commercial real estate loans.\nCommercial real estate and multi-family loans typically have higher loan balances, are more difficult to evaluate and monitor, and involve a higher degree of risk than residential one-to-four family loans. As a result, commercial real estate and multi-family loans are generally priced at a higher rate of interest than residential one-to-four family loans. Often payments on loans secured by commercial properties are dependent on the successful operation and management of the property securing the loan or business conducted on the property securing the loan; therefore, repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral values and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral being viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. The Company seeks to minimize these risks by generally limiting the maximum loan-to-value ratio to 80% and strictly scrutinizing the financial condition of the borrower, the quality of the collateral and the management of the property securing the loan. Loans are secured by first mortgages and often require specified debt service coverage (\u201cDSC\u201d) ratios depending on the characteristics of the collateral. The Company generally imposes a minimum DSC ratio of 1.20 for loans secured by income producing properties. Rates and other terms on such loans generally depend on our assessment of credit risk after considering such factors as the borrower\u2019s financial condition and credit history, loan-to-value ratio, DSC ratio and other factors.\nThe Company actively pursues commercial real estate loans. Loan demand within the Company\u2019s market area was competitive in fiscal year 2023 as economic conditions and competition for strong credit-worthy borrowers remained high. At March 31, 2023, the Company had one commercial real estate loan of $100,000 on non-accrual status. At March 31, 2022, the Company had one commercial real estate loan of $122,000 on non-accrual status. For more information concerning risks related to commercial real estate loans, see Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Risks Related to Our Lending \u2013 Commercial and multi-family real estate lending involves higher risks than one-to-four family real estate and other consume lending, which exposes us to increased lending risks.\u201d\nLand loans represent loans made to developers for the purpose of acquiring raw land and/or for the subsequent development and sale of residential lots. Such loans typically finance land purchases and infrastructure development of properties (e.g., roads, utilities, etc.) with the aim of making improved lots ready for subsequent sales to consumers or builders for ultimate construction of residential units. The primary source of repayment is generally the cash flow from developer sale of lots or improved parcels of land, secondary sources and personal guarantees, which may provide an additional measure of security for such loans. At March 31, 2023, land loans totaled $6.4 million, or 0.64% of total loans, compared to $11.6 million, or 1.16% of total loans at March 31, 2022. The largest land loan had an outstanding balance at March 31, 2023 of $1.8 million and was performing according to its original payment terms. At March 31, 2023, all of the land loans were secured by properties located in Washington and Oregon. At March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no land loans on non-accrual status.\nReal Estate Construction.\n The Company originates three types of residential construction loans: (i) speculative construction loans, (ii) custom/presold construction loans and (iii) construction/permanent loans. The Company also originates construction loans for the development of business properties and multi-family dwellings. All of the Company\u2019s real estate construction loans were made on properties located in Washington and Oregon.\n\u200b\n7\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe composition of the Company\u2019s construction loan portfolio, including undisbursed funds, was as follows at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nAt March\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n2023\n\u200b\n2022\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAmount \n(1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPercent\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAmount \n(1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPercent\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\nSpeculative construction\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 16,224\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n 19.23\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 16,561\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n 26.22\n%\nCommercial/multi-family construction\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 63,973\n\u00a0\n 75.85\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 37,429\n\u00a0\n 59.27\n\u200b\nCustom/presold construction\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 4,149\n\u00a0\n 4.92\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 9,160\n\u00a0\n 14.51\n\u200b\nTotal\n\u200b\n$\n 84,346\n\u00a0\n 100.00\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 63,150\n\u00a0\n 100.00\n%\n\u200b\n(1)\n Includes undisbursed funds of $36.6 million and $39.0 million at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAt March 31, 2023, the balance of the Company\u2019s construction loan portfolio, including undisbursed funds, was $84.3 million compared to $63.2 million at March 31, 2022. The $21.1 million increase was primarily due to a $26.5 million increase in commercial/multi-family construction loans, partially offset by a decrease of $5.0 million in custom/presold construction loans. The Company plans to continue to proactively manage its construction loan portfolio in fiscal year 2024 while continuing to originate new construction loans to selected customers.\nSpeculative construction loans are made to home builders and are termed \u201cspeculative\u201d because the home builder does not have, at the time of loan origination, a signed contract with a home buyer who has a commitment for permanent financing with either the Company or another lender for the finished home. The home buyer may be identified either during or after the construction period, with the risk that the builder will have to service the speculative construction loan and finance real estate taxes and other carrying costs of the completed home for a significant period of time after the completion of construction until a home buyer is identified. The largest speculative construction loan at March 31, 2023 was a loan to finance the construction of 36 townhomes totaling $8.1 million that is secured by property located in the Company\u2019s market area. The average balance of loans in the speculative construction loan portfolio at March 31, 2023 was $959,000. At March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no speculative construction loans on non-accrual status.\nPresold construction loans are made to homebuilders who, at the time of construction, have a signed contract with a home buyer who has a commitment for permanent financing for the finished home from the Company or another lender. Presold construction loans are generally originated for a term of 12 months. At March 31, 2023 and 2022, presold construction loans totaled $4.1 million and $4.5 million, respectively.\nThe composition of land \u00a0and speculative/presold construction loans by geographical area is as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands):\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNorthwest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSouthwest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOther\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOregon\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWashington\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWashington\n\u200b\nTotal\nMarch\u00a031,\u00a02023\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nLand\n\u200b\n$\n 1,884\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 4,553\n\u200b\n$\n \u2014\n\u200b\n$\n 6,437\nSpeculative and presold construction\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 17,105\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 1,092\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 18,197\nTotal\n\u200b\n$\n 1,884\n\u200b\n$\n 21,658\n\u200b\n$\n 1,092\n\u200b\n$\n 24,634\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nMarch\u00a031,\u00a02022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nLand\n\u200b\n$\n 2,111\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 9,445\n\u200b\n$\n \u2014\n\u200b\n$\n 11,556\nSpeculative and presold construction\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 10,989\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 430\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 11,419\nTotal\n\u200b\n$\n 2,111\n\u200b\n$\n 20,434\n\u200b\n$\n 430\n\u200b\n$\n 22,975\n\u200b\nUnlike speculative and presold construction loans, custom construction loans are made directly to the homeowner. Construction/permanent loans are originated to the homeowner rather than the homebuilder along with a commitment by the Company to originate a permanent loan to the homeowner to repay the construction loan at the completion of construction. The construction phase of a construction/permanent loan generally lasts six to nine months. At the completion of construction, the Company may either originate a fixed-rate mortgage loan or an adjustable rate mortgage (\u201cARM\u201d) loan or use its mortgage \n8\n\n\nTable of Contents\nbrokerage capabilities to obtain permanent financing for the customer with another lender. For adjustable rate loans, the interest rates adjust on their first adjustment date. See \u201cMortgage Brokerage\u201d and \u201cMortgage Loan Servicing\u201d below for more information. At March 31, 2023, the Company had no construction/permanent loans.\nThe Company provides construction financing for non-residential business properties and multi-family dwellings. At March 31, 2023, commercial construction loans totaled $29.6 million, or 61.9% of total real estate construction loans, and 2.9% of total loans. Borrowers may be the business owner/occupier of the building who intends to operate their business from the property upon construction, or non-owner developers. The expected source of repayment of these loans is typically the sale or refinancing of the project upon completion of the construction phase. In certain circumstances, the Company may provide or commit to take-out financing upon construction. Take-out financing is subject to the project meeting specific underwriting guidelines. No assurance can be given that such take-out financing will be available upon project completion. These loans are secured by office buildings, retail rental space, mini storage facilities, assisted living facilities and multi-family dwellings located in the Company\u2019s market area. At March 31, 2023, the largest commercial construction loan had a balance of $6.6 million and was performing according to its original repayment terms. The average balance of loans in the commercial construction loan portfolio at March 31, 2023 was $2.1 million. At March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no commercial construction loans on non-accrual status.\nThe Company has originated construction and land acquisition and development loans where a component of the cost of the project was the interest required to service the debt during the construction period of the loan, sometimes known as interest reserves. The Company allows disbursements of this interest component as long as the project is progressing as originally projected and if there has been no deterioration in the financial standing of the borrower or the underlying project. If the Company makes a determination that there is such deterioration, or if the loan becomes nonperforming, the Company halts any disbursement of those funds identified for use in paying interest. In some cases, additional interest reserves may be taken by use of deposited funds or through credit lines secured by separate and additional collateral. For additional information concerning the risks related to construction lending, see Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Risks Related to our Lending Activities \u2013 Our real estate construction and land acquisition and development loans expose us to risk.\u201d\nConsumer Lending.\n Consumer loans totaled $101.5 million at March 31, 2023 and were comprised of $88.8 million of real estate one-to-four family loans, $10.3 million of home equity lines of credit, $552,000 of land loans to consumers for the future construction of one-to-four family homes and $1.8 million of other secured and unsecured consumer loans.\nThe majority of our real estate one-to-four family loans are located in the Company\u2019s primary market area. Underwriting standards require that real estate one-to-four family loans generally be owner occupied and that originated loan amounts not exceed 80% (95% with private mortgage insurance) of the lesser of current appraised value or cost of the underlying collateral. Terms typically range from 15 to 30 years. At March 31, 2023, the Company had three residential real estate loans totaling $86,000 on non-accrual status compared to two residential real estate loans totaling $51,000 at March 31, 2022. All of these loans were secured by properties located in Oregon and Washington. The Company no longer originates real estate one-to-four family loans. During the fiscal year 2023, the Company purchased $26.8 million real estate one-to-four family loans as a way to supplement loan originations in this category.\nThe Company also originates a variety of installment loans, including loans for debt consolidation and other purposes, automobile loans, boat loans and savings account loans. At March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no installment loans on non-accrual status.\u00a0The Company did not purchase any automobile loans during fiscal years 2023 and 2022 and does not have plans to purchase any additional automobile loan pools.\nInstallment consumer loans generally entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as mobile homes, automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. In these cases, we face the risk that any collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. Thus, the recovery and sale of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the principal outstanding on these loans as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower\u2019s continuing financial stability and are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.

The Company issues commitments to originate commercial loans, other real estate mortgage loans, construction loans, real estate one-to-four family loans and other installment loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Commitments to originate loans are conditional and are honored for up to 45 days subject to the Company\u2019s usual terms and conditions. Collateral is not required to support commitments. At March 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $12.5 million compared to $20.0 million at March 31, 2022.\nMortgage Brokerage.\n The Company employs commissioned brokers who originate mortgage loans (including construction loans) for various mortgage companies. The loans brokered to mortgage companies are closed in the name of, and funded by, the purchasing mortgage company and are not originated as an asset of the Company. In return, the Company receives a fee ranging from 1.5% to 2.0% of the loan amount that it shares with the commissioned broker. Loans previously brokered to the Company are closed on the Company\u2019s books and the commissioned broker receives a portion of the origination fee. Beginning in fiscal year 2021, the Company transitioned to a model where it no longer originates and sells mortgage loans to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Company (\u201cFHLMC\u201d) as all mortgage loan originations are instead brokered to various third-party mortgage companies. The Company does, however, continue to service its existing FHLMC portfolio. Brokered loans totaled $22.0 million and $58.1 million as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were no loans brokered to the Company for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. Gross fees of $346,000, including brokered loan fees, were earned in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, gross fees earned were $1.1 million, which included brokered loan fees and fees for loans sold to the FHLMC. The interest rate environment has a strong influence on the loan volume and amount of fees generated from the mortgage broker activity. In general, during periods of rising interest rates, the volume of loans and the amount \n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\nof loan fees generally decrease as a result of decreased mortgage loan demand. Conversely, during periods of falling interest rates, the volume of loans and the amount of loan fees generally increase as a result of the increased mortgage loan demand.\u00a0\nMortgage Loan Servicing.\n\u00a0 The Company is a qualified servicer for the FHLMC. Prior to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the Company historically sold its fixed-rate residential one-to-four family mortgage loans that it originated with maturities of 15 years or more and balloon mortgages to the FHLMC as part of its asset/liability strategy. Mortgage loans were sold to the FHLMC on a non-recourse basis whereby foreclosure losses are the responsibility of the FHLMC and not the Company. Upon sale, the Company continues to collect payments on the loans, supervise foreclosure proceedings, and otherwise service the loans. At March 31, 2023, total loans serviced for others were $63.4 million, of which $36.5 million were serviced for the FHLMC.\nNonperforming Assets.\n Nonperforming assets were $1.9 million or 0.12% of total assets at March 31, 2023 compared with $22.1 million or 1.27% of total assets at March 31, 2022. The Company had net recoveries totaling $36,000 during fiscal 2023 compared to net charge-offs of $30,000 during fiscal 2022. The decrease in nonperforming assets is attributed to the progress made in resolving the delay in servicing transfer between two third-party servicers of SBA and United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d) government guaranteed loans, as further discussed below. Non-performing SBA government guaranteed loans totaled $1.6 million at March 31, 2023 compared to $21.8 million at March 31, 2022.\nLoans are reviewed regularly and it is the Company\u2019s general policy that when a loan is 90 days or more delinquent or when collection of principal or interest appears doubtful, it is placed on non-accrual status, at which time the accrual of interest ceases and a reserve for any unrecoverable accrued interest is established and charged against operations. In general, payments received on non-accrual loans are applied to reduce the outstanding principal balance on a cash-basis method.\nThe Company continues to proactively manage its residential construction and land acquisition and development loan portfolios. At March 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s residential construction and land acquisition and development loan portfolios were $18.2 million and $6.4 million, respectively, as compared to $11.4 million and $11.6 million, respectively, at March 31, 2022. At March 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no nonperforming loans in the residential construction loan portfolio or the land acquisition and development portfolio. For the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no charge-offs or recoveries in the residential construction and land acquisition and development loan portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company\u2019s nonperforming loans at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMarch\u00a031,\u00a02023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMarch\u00a031,\u00a02022\n\u200b\n\u200b\nNumber\u00a0of\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nNumber\u00a0of\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLoans\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBalance\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLoans\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBalance\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nCommercial business\n\u00a0\n 1\n\u200b\n$\n 79\n\u00a0\n 1\n\u200b\n$\n 100\nCommercial real estate\n\u00a0\n 1\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 100\n\u00a0\n 1\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 122\nConsumer\n\u00a0\n 3\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 86\n\u00a0\n 2\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 51\n  Subtotal\n\u200b\n 5\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 265\n\u200b\n 4\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 273\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nSBA and USDA Government Guaranteed\n\u200b\n 6\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 1,587\n\u200b\n 66\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 21,826\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nTotal\n\u00a0\n 11\n\u200b\n$\n 1,852\n\u00a0\n 70\n\u200b\n$\n 22,099\n\u200b\nThe Company continues its efforts to work out problem loans, seek full repayment or pursue foreclosure proceedings and has made significant progress in regards to the SBA and USDA government guaranteed loan servicing transfer. At March 31, 2023, the Bank holds approximately $1.6 million of the government guaranteed portion of SBA and USDA loans originated by other banks that, when purchased, were placed into a Direct Registration Certificate (\u201cDRC\u201d) program by the SBA\u2019s former fiscal transfer agent, Colson Inc. (\u201cColson\u201d) that remain to be reconciled. Under the DRC program, Colson was required to remit monthly payments to the investor holding the guaranteed balance, whether or not a payment had actually been received from the borrower. In 2020, Colson did not successfully retain its existing contract as the SBA\u2019s fiscal transfer agent and began transitioning servicing over to a new company called Guidehouse. In late 2021, Guidehouse, under their contract with the SBA, declined to continue the DRC program. After declining to continue the DRC program, all payments under the DRC program began to be held by Guidehouse or Colson until the DRC program could be unwound and the DRC holdings converted into normal pass through certificates. As part of unwinding the DRC program, Colson has requested investors who had received payments in advance of the borrower actually remitting payment return advanced funds before they will process the conversion of certificates. The Bank \n11\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncontinues to work with Colson on the reconciliation and transfer of the two remaining loans. The Bank expects the reconciliation and unwinding process to continue and until these processes are completed for all loans being transferred, with such loans continuing to be reflected as past due. These nonperforming government guaranteed loans are not considered non-accrual loans because there is no concern of the collectability of the full principal and interest given the Company purchased the guaranteed portion of these loans which is backed by government guaranteed interest certificates. \u00a0At March 31, 2023, all of \u00a0the Company\u2019s nonperforming loans exclusive of the SBA and USDA government guaranteed loans are to borrowers with properties located in Southwest Washington. At March 31, 2023, 9.69% of the Company\u2019s nonperforming loans, totaling $179,000 were measured for impairment. These loans have been charged down to the estimated fair market value of the collateral less selling costs or carry a specific reserve to reduce the net carrying value. There were no reserves associated with these nonperforming loans that were measured for impairment at March 31, 2023. At March 31, 2023, the largest single nonperforming loan was a USDA government guaranteed loan for $879,000. The largest single nonperforming loan exclusive of the SBA and USDA government guaranteed loans was a commercial real estate loan for $100,000 at March 31, 2023.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company\u2019s nonperforming assets at the dates indicated (in thousands):\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nAt\u00a0March\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nLoans accounted for on a non-accrual basis:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\nCommercial business\n\u200b\n$\n 97\n\u200b\n$\n 118\nCommercial real estate\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 100\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 122\nConsumer\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 86\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 51\nTotal\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 283\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 291\nAccruing loans which are contractually past due 90 days or more\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1,569\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 21,808\nTotal nonperforming loans\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1,852\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 22,099\nReal estate owned (\u201cREO\u201d)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\nTotal nonperforming assets\n\u200b\n$\n 1,852\n\u200b\n$\n 22,099\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nForegone interest on non-accrual loans\n\u200b\n$\n 14\n\u200b\n$\n 24\n\u200b\nThe following tables set forth information regarding the Company\u2019s nonperforming assets by loan type and geographical area at the dates indicated (in thousands):\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSouthwest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWashington\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOther\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTotal\nMarch\u00a031,\u00a02023\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nCommercial business\n\u200b\n$\n 79\n\u200b\n$\n \u2014\n\u200b\n$\n 79\nCommercial real estate\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 100\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 100\nConsumer\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 86\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 86\n   Subtotal\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 265\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 265\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nSBA and USDA Government Guaranteed\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 1,587\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 1,587\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nTotal nonperforming assets\n\u200b\n$\n 265\n\u200b\n$\n 1,587\n\u200b\n$\n 1,852\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nMarch\u00a031,\u00a02022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nCommercial business\n\u200b\n$\n 100\n\u200b\n$\n \u2014\n\u200b\n$\n 100\nCommercial real estate\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 122\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 122\nConsumer\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 51\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 51\n   Subtotal\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 273\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 273\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nSBA and USDA Government Guaranteed\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 21,826\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 21,826\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nTotal nonperforming assets\n\u200b\n$\n 273\n\u200b\n$\n 21,826\n\u200b\n$\n 22,099\n\u200b\n\u200b\n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOther loans of concern, which are classified as substandard loans and are not presently included in the non-accrual category, consist of loans where the borrowers have cash flow problems, or the collateral securing the respective loans may be inadequate. In either or both of these situations, the borrowers may be unable to comply with the present loan repayment terms, and the loans may subsequently be included in the non-accrual category.

At March 31, 2023, loans 30 \u2013 89 days past due were comprised of SBA government guaranteed loans (which are included in commercial business), commercial business and consumer loans. The SBA government guaranteed loans comprise a substantial amount of the total loans 30-89 days past due at March 31, 2023. At March 31, 2022, loans 30 \u2013 89 days past due were comprised of SBA government guaranteed loans, residential real estate construction and consumer loans. There were no commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) loans 30 \u2013 89 days past at March 31, 2023 or March 31, 2022. At March 31, 2023, CRE loans represent the largest portion of our loan portfolio at 55.95% of total loans and commercial business loans represent 23.08% of total loans.\nTroubled debt restructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) are loans for which the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower\u2019s financial condition, has granted a concession to the borrower that it would otherwise not consider. A TDR typically involves a modification of terms such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or face amount of the loan, a reduction of accrued interest, and/or an extension of the maturity date(s) at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk.\nTDRs are considered impaired loans when a loan is deemed to be impaired, the amount of the impairment is measured using discounted cash flows and the original note rate, except when the loan is collateral dependent. In these cases, the estimated fair value of the collateral (less any selling costs, if applicable) is used. Impairment is recognized as a specific component within the allowance for loan losses if the estimated value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan. When the amount of the impairment represents a confirmed loss, it is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. At March 31, 2023, the Company had TDRs totaling $629,000, of which $450,000 were on accrual status. The $179,000 of TDRs accounted for on a non-accrual basis at March 31, 2023 are included as nonperforming loans in the nonperforming asset table above. All of the Company\u2019s TDRs were paying as agreed at March 31, 2023. The related amount of interest income recognized on these TDR loans was $24,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023.\nThe Company has determined that, in certain circumstances, it is appropriate to split a loan into multiple notes. This typically includes a nonperforming charged-off loan that is not supported by the cash flow of the relationship and a performing loan that is supported by the cash flow. These may also be split into multiple notes to align portions of the loan balance with the various sources of repayment when more than one exists. Generally, the new loans are restructured based on customary underwriting standards. In situations where they are not, the policy exception qualifies as a concession, and if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, the loans are accounted for as TDRs. At March 31, 2023, no loans had been restructured in this manner.\nThe accrual status of a loan may change after it has been classified as a TDR. The Company\u2019s general policy related to TDRs is to perform a credit evaluation of the borrower\u2019s financial condition and prospects for repayment under the revised terms. This evaluation includes consideration of the borrower\u2019s sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable period of time. A sustained period of repayment performance generally would be a minimum of six months and may include repayments made prior to the restructuring date. If repayment of principal and interest appears doubtful, it is placed on non-accrual status.\nIn accordance with the Company\u2019s policy guidelines, unsecured loans are generally charged-off when no payments have been received for three consecutive months unless an alternative action plan is in effect. Consumer installment loans delinquent six months or more that have not received at least 75% of their required monthly payment in the last 90 days are charged-off. In addition, loans discharged in bankruptcy proceedings are charged-off. Loans under bankruptcy protection with no payments \n13\n\n\nTable of Contents\nreceived for four consecutive months are charged-off. The outstanding balance of a secured loan that is in excess of the net realizable value is generally charged-off if no payments are received for four to five consecutive months. However, charge-offs are postponed if alternative proposals to restructure, obtain additional guarantors, obtain additional assets as collateral or a potential sale of the underlying collateral would result in full repayment of the outstanding loan balance. Once any other potential sources of repayment are exhausted, the impaired portion of the loan is charged-off. Regardless of whether a loan is unsecured or collateralized, once an amount is determined to be a confirmed loan loss it is promptly charged-off.\nAsset Classification.\n Federal regulations provide for the classification of lower quality loans and other assets (such as other real estate owned and repossessed property), debt and equity securities, as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and pay capacity of the borrower or of any collateral pledged. Substandard assets have a well-defined weakness and include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.\nWhen the Company classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, we may determine that the loan is impaired and establish a specific allowance in an amount we deem prudent to address the risk specifically or we may allow the loss to be addressed in the general allowance. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been specifically allocated to particular problem assets. When a problem asset is classified by us as a loss, we are required to charge off the asset in the period in which it is deemed uncollectible.\nThe aggregate amount of the Company\u2019s classified loans (comprised entirely of substandard loans), general loss allowances, specific loss allowances and net charge-offs (recoveries) were as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands):\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAt\u00a0or\u00a0For\u00a0the\u00a0Year\n\u200b\n\u200b\nEnded\u00a0March\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nClassified loans\n\u200b\n$\n 2,647\n\u200b\n$\n 6,405\nGeneral loss allowances\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 15,303\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 14,515\nSpecific loss allowances\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 6\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 8\nNet charge-offs (recoveries)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (36)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 30\n\u200b\nAll loans on non-accrual status as of March 31, 2023 were categorized as classified loans with the exception of one commercial business loan for $18,000 which is fully guaranteed by the SBA. Classified loans at March 31, 2023 were comprised of \u00a0three commercial business loans totaling $117,000, three commercial real estate loans totaling $2.4 million (the largest of which was $1.5 million) and three one-to-four family real estate loans totaling $86,000. The net decrease in classified loans is primarily attributed to the upgrade of one commercial real estate loan totaling $3.6 million. As discussed earlier, nonperforming SBA and USDA government guaranteed loans totaled $1.6 million. These nonperforming government guaranteed loans are not considered classified as there is no well-defined weakness and do not include the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected in regard to these loans. The Company purchased the guaranteed portion of these loans which is backed by government guaranteed interest certificates and expects to receive all principal and interest on these loans.\nAllowance for Loan Losses.\n The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) guidelines. The adequacy of the allowance is evaluated monthly to maintain the allowance at levels sufficient to provide for inherent losses existing at the balance sheet date. The key components to the evaluation are the Company\u2019s internal loan review function by its credit administration, which reviews and monitors the risk and quality of the loan portfolio; as well as the Company\u2019s external loan reviews and its loan classification systems. Credit officers are expected to monitor their loan portfolios and make recommendations to change loan grades whenever changes are warranted. Credit administration approves any changes to loan grades and monitors loan grades. For additional discussion of the Company\u2019s methodology for assessing the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses see Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2013 Critical Accounting Estimates.\u201d\n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn accordance with GAAP, loans acquired from MBank during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 were recorded at their estimated fair value, which resulted in a net discount to the loans\u2019 contractual amounts, of which a portion reflects a discount for possible credit losses. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value, and, as a result, no allowance for loan losses is recorded for acquired loans at the acquisition date. The discount recorded on the acquired loans is not reflected in the allowance for loan losses or related allowance coverage ratios. However, we believe it should be considered when comparing certain financial ratios of the Company calculated in periods after the MBank transaction, compared to the same financial ratios of the Company in periods prior to the MBank transaction. The net discount on these acquired loans was $228,000 and $371,000 at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $750,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 compared to a recapture of loan losses of $4.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. The increase in the allowance for loan losses in fiscal year 2023 is mainly attributed to an isolated downgrade of a commercial real estate loan for $15.9 million that occurred in the fourth quarter. \nAt March 31, 2023, the Company had an allowance for loan losses of $15.3 million, or 1.52% of total loans, compared to $14.5 million, or 1.47% of total loans at March 31, 2022. Net recoveries totaled $36,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 compared to net charge-offs of $30,000 in the prior fiscal year. Criticized loans, which are comprised of watch and special mention loans, increased $11.3 million to $19.1 million at March 31, 2023 from $7.8 million at March 31, 2022. Classified loans decreased $3.8 million to $2.6 million at March 31, 2023 compared to $6.4 million at March 31, 2022. The net increase in criticized loans\u00a0is mainly attributed to the downgrade of the $15.9 million commercial real estate loan mentioned above offset by the upgrade to a pass rating of a $6.6 million commercial real estate loan that was part of the criticized total at March 31, 2022. Additionally, the criticized balance at March 31, 2023 includes three commercial business loans and one commercial real estate loan totaling $1.3 million to a related borrower that were downgraded in the third quarter. The decrease in classified loans is mainly due to the upgrade to a pass rating of a $3.6 million commercial real estate loan. The coverage ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was 826.62% at March 31, 2023 compared to 65.72% at March 31, 2022, and excluding SBA and USDA government guaranteed loans was 5777.0% at March 31, 2023. \u00a0The Company\u2019s general valuation allowance to non-impaired loans was 1.52% and 1.47% at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nManagement considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate at March 31, 2023 to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio, and the Company believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with GAAP. However, a decline in national and local economic conditions (including a recession and continued inflationary pressures), results of examinations by the Company\u2019s banking regulators, or other factors could result in a material increase in the allowance for loan losses and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s future financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses will be adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate or should collateral values decline as a result of the factors discussed elsewhere in this document.\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category as of the dates indicated (dollars in

The Company\u2019s investment objectives are: to provide and maintain liquidity within regulatory guidelines; to maintain a balance of high quality, diversified investments to minimize risk; to provide collateral for pledging requirements; to serve as a balance to earnings; and to optimize returns. The policy permits investment in various types of liquid assets (generally debt and asset-backed securities) permissible under applicable regulations, which includes U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, \u201cbank qualified\u201d municipal bonds, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks, repurchase agreements, federal funds, real estate mortgage investment conduits (\u201cREMICS\u201d) and mortgage-backed securities (\u201cMBS\u201d), but does not permit investment in non-investment grade bonds. The policy also dictates the criteria for classifying investment securities into one of three categories: held to maturity, available for sale or trading. At March 31, 2023, no investment securities were held for trading purposes. At March 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s investment portfolio consisted of solely debt securities and no equity securities. See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2013 Critical Accounting Estimates.\u201d\nThe Company primarily purchases agency securities and a combination of MBS backed by government agencies (FHLMC, Fannie Mae (\u201cFNMA\u201d), SBA or Ginnie Mae (\u201cGNMA\u201d)). FHLMC and FNMA securities are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, while SBA and GNMA securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. At March 31, 2023, the Company owned no privately issued MBS. Our REMICS are MBS issued by FHLMC, FNMA and GNMA and our \n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCRE MBS are issued by FNMA. The Company does not believe that it has any exposure to sub-prime lending in its investment securities portfolio.

Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources. They may also be used on a longer-term basis for general business purposes.\nDeposit Accounts.\n The Company attracts deposits from within its primary market area by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments, including demand deposits, negotiable order of withdrawal (\u201cNOW\u201d) accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit and retirement savings plans. The Company has focused on building customer relationship deposits which include both business and consumer depositors. Deposit account terms vary according to, among other factors, the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. In determining the terms of its deposit accounts, the Company considers the rates offered by its competition, profitability to the Company, matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns.\nThe following table sets forth the average balances of deposit accounts held by the Company at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended March\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n2023\n\u200b\n2022\n\u200b\n2021\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\nAverage\n\u200b\nAverage\n\u200b\nAverage\n\u200b\nAverage\n\u200b\nAverage\n\u200b\nAverage\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBalance\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRate\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBalance\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRate\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBalance\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRate\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nNon-interest-bearing demand\n\u200b\n$\n 480,029\n\u00a0\n0.00\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 476,203\n\u00a0\n0.00\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 387,579\n\u00a0\n0.00\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nInterest-bearing checking\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 286,627\n\u00a0\n0.03\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 279,053\n\u00a0\n0.03\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 225,579\n\u00a0\n0.04\n\u200b\nSavings accounts\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 308,840\n\u00a0\n0.07\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 318,885\n\u00a0\n0.08\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 257,285\n\u00a0\n0.16\n\u200b\nMoney market accounts\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 266,795\n\u00a0\n0.16\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 272,161\n\u00a0\n0.06\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 204,931\n\u00a0\n0.07\n\u200b\nCertificates of deposit\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 103,484\n\u00a0\n0.75\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 117,391\n\u00a0\n0.80\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 129,928\n\u00a0\n1.45\n\u200b\nTotal\n\u200b\n$\n 1,445,775\n\u00a0\n0.10\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 1,463,693\n\u00a0\n0.10\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 1,205,302\n\u00a0\n0.21\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\nDeposit accounts totaled $1.3 billion at March 31, 2023 compared to $1.5 billion at March 31, 2022. The Company did not have any wholesale-brokered deposits at March 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company continues to focus on core deposits and growth generated by customer relationships as opposed to obtaining deposits through the wholesale markets, although the Company continued to experience competition for customer deposits within its market area during fiscal year 2023. Core branch deposits (comprised of all demand, savings, interest checking accounts and all time deposits excluding wholesale-brokered deposits, trust account deposits, Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts (\u201cIOLTA\u201d), public funds, and internet based deposits) at March 31, 2023 decreased $250.1 million since March 31, 2022 due to deposit pricing pressures in our market and customers seeking higher yielding investment alternatives. At March 31, 2023, the Company had $22.8 million, or 1.80% of total deposits, in Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (\u201cCDARS\u201d) and Insured Cash Sweep (\u201cICS\u201d) deposits, which were gathered from customers within the Company\u2019s primary market-area. CDARS and ICS deposits allow customers access to FDIC insurance on deposits exceeding the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit.\nAt March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company also had $21.3 million and $25.9 million, respectively, in deposits from public entities located in the States of Washington and Oregon, all of which were fully covered by FDIC insurance or secured by pledged collateral.\nThe Company is enrolled in an internet deposit listing service. Under this listing service, the Company may post certificates of deposit rates on an internet site where institutional investors have the ability to deposit funds with the Company. At March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have any deposits through this listing service as the Company chose not to utilize these internet-based deposits. Although the Company did not originate any internet based deposits during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, the Company may do so in the future consistent with its asset/liability objectives. \n\u200b\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDeposit growth remains a key strategic focus for the Company and our ability to achieve deposit growth, particularly in core deposits, is subject to many risk factors including the effects of competitive pricing pressures, changing customer deposit behavior, and increasing or decreasing interest rate environments. Adverse developments with respect to any of these risk factors could limit the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain deposits and could have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs of March 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately $225.7 million and $320.0 million, respectively, of our deposit portfolio was uninsured. The uninsured amounts are estimates based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank\u2019s regulatory reporting requirements.

Advances from the FHLB and borrowings from the FRB are typically secured by the Bank\u2019s commercial business loans, commercial real estate loans and real estate one-to-four family loans. At March 31, 2023, the Bank had FHLB advances totaling $123.8 million and no FRB borrowings. At March 31, 2022, the Bank did not have any FHLB advances or FRB borrowings.\nThe FHLB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. As a member, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB and is authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of its mortgage loans and other assets (primarily securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the U.S.) provided certain standards related to credit-worthiness have been met. The FHLB determines specific lines of credit for each member institution and the Bank has a line of credit with the FHLB equal to 45% of its total assets to the extent the Bank provides qualifying collateral and holds sufficient FHLB stock. At March 31, 2023, the Bank had an available credit capacity of $718.9 million, subject to sufficient collateral and stock investment.\nThe Bank also has a borrowing arrangement with the FRB with an available credit facility of $57.4 million, subject to pledged collateral, as of March 31, 2023.

The trust preferred securities accrue and pay distributions periodically at specified annual rates as provided in each trust agreement. The trusts used the net proceeds from each of the offerings to purchase a like amount of junior subordinated debentures (the \u201cDebentures\u201d) of the Company. The Debentures are the sole assets of the trusts. The Company\u2019s obligations under the Debentures and related documents, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the obligations of the trusts. The trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the Debentures or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indentures. The Company has the right to redeem the Debentures in whole or in part on or after specific dates, at a redemption price specified in the indentures governing the Debentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date. The Company also has the right to defer the payment of interest on each of the Debentures for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive quarters, provided that the deferral period does not extend beyond the stated maturity.

As a Washington state-chartered commercial bank, the Bank\u2019s regulators are the WDFI and the FDIC, rather than the OCC. The Company converted from a Savings and Loan Holding Company to a Bank Holding Company and the Federal Reserve remained its primary federal regulator.\nThe following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations which are applicable to the Company and the Bank. The description of these laws and regulations, as well as descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations.\nLegislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress (\u201cCongress\u201d) or the Washington State Legislature that may affect the Company\u2019s and Bank\u2019s operations. In addition, the regulations governing the Company and the Bank may be amended from time to time by the WDFI, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve or the SEC, as appropriate. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could have an adverse effect\u00a0on our operations and financial condition. We cannot predict whether any such changes may occur.\nThe WDFI and FDIC have extensive enforcement authority over all Washington state-chartered commercial banks, including the Bank. The Federal Reserve has the same type of authority over Riverview.\nRegulation and Supervision of the Bank\nGeneral.\n As a state-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to applicable provisions of Washington state law and regulations of the WDFI in addition to federal law and regulations of the FDIC applicable to state banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System. State law and regulations govern the Bank\u2019s ability to take deposits and pay interest, to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate, to make consumer loans, to invest in securities, to offer various banking services to its customers and to establish branch offices. Under state law, commercial banks in Washington also generally have all of the powers that national banks have under federal laws and regulations. The Bank is subject to periodic examination by and reporting requirements of the WDFI and FDIC.\nCapital Requirements.\n Federally insured financial institutions, such as the Bank and\u00a0their holding companies, are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital. The Bank is subject to capital regulations adopted by the FDIC, which establish minimum required ratios for a common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The capital standards require the maintenance of the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to subsidiary banks generally apply to bank holding companies. However, the Federal Reserve has provided a \u201cSmall Bank Holding Company\u201d exception to its consolidated capital requirements, and bank holding companies with less than $3.0 billion of consolidated assets are not subject to the consolidated holding company capital requirements unless otherwise directed by the Federal Reserve.\nThe Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d), enacted in May 2018, required the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, to establish for institutions with assets of less than $10 billion a \u201ccommunity bank leverage ratio\u201d or \u201cCBLR\u201d of between 8 to 10%. Institutions with capital meeting or exceeding the ratio and otherwise complying with the specified requirements (including off-balance sheet exposures of 25% or less of total assets and trading assets and liabilities of 5% or less of total assets) and electing the alternative framework are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. The CBLR was established at 9% Tier 1 capital to total average assets, effective January 1, 2020. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. An institution that temporarily ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two- quarter grace period to again achieve compliance. Failure to meet the qualifying criteria within the grace period or maintain a leverage ratio of 8% or greater requires the institution to comply with the generally applicable capital requirements. The Bank has not elected to use the CBLR framework as of March 31, 2023.\n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCertain changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, including the phasing out of certain instruments as qualifying capital, are subject to transition periods, most of which have expired. The Bank does not have any such instruments. Because of the Bank\u2019s asset size, the Bank elected to take a one-time option to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in its capital calculations.\nThe Bank also must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses.\nIn order to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations described below, the Bank must maintain a CET1 risk-based ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% and a leverage ratio of 5%, and the Bank must not be subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which its primary federal banking regulator requires it to maintain a specific capital level. As of March 31, 2023, the Bank met the requirements to be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and met the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement. For a complete description of the Bank\u2019s required and actual capital levels on March 31, 2023, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) has adopted a new accounting standard for GAAP that is effective for us for our first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2022. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) requires FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies (banking organizations) to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the current method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, a banking organization must record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowances as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under the current methodology and the amount required under CECL. For a banking organization, implementation of CECL may reduce retained earnings, and to affect other items, in a manner that reduces its regulatory capital.\nThe federal banking regulators (the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC) have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital.\nPrompt Corrective Action.\n Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework for FDIC-insured institutions based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution\u2019s category generally depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures, which include risk-based capital measures, a leverage ratio capital measure, and certain other factors. An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits generally. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered under- capitalized. The previously referenced final rule establishing an elective \u201ccommunity bank leverage ratio\u201d regulatory capital framework provides that a qualifying institution whose capital exceeds the CBLR and opts to use that framework will be considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for purposes of prompt corrective action.\nUndercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by the Bank to comply with applicable capital requirements would, if unremedied, result in progressively more severe restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator. Banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System.\n The Bank is a member of the FHLB, which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks that administer the home financing credit function of savings institutions, each of which serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. See Business \u2013 \u201cDeposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds \u2013 Borrowings.\u201d As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB. At March 31, 2023, the Bank held $6.9 million \n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\nin FHLB stock, which is comprised of $1.9 million of membership stock and $5.0 million of activity stock from borrowing activities. At March 31, 2023, the Bank is in compliance with FHLB stock requirements. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, the Bank redeemed $102,000 of FHLB membership stock at par due to the decrease in the Bank\u2019s consolidated assets at December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021.\nThe FHLB continues to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bank\u2019s FHLB stock may result in a decrease in net income and possibly capital.\nInsurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC.\n The Bank\u2019s deposits are insured up to $250,000 per separately insured deposit ownership right or category by the Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d) of the FDIC. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, FDIC-insured institutions. The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums quarterly on each FDIC-insured institution applied to its deposit base, which is their average consolidated total assets minus its Tier 1 capital. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment. Total base assessment rates currently range from 3 to 30 basis points subject to certain adjustments. \nExtraordinary growth in insured deposits during the first and second quarters of 2020 caused the DIF reserve ratio to decline below the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent as of June 30, 2020. \u00a0In September 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors adopted a Restoration Plan to restore the reserve ratio to at least 1.35 percent within eight years, absent extraordinary circumstances, as required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. \u00a0The Restoration Plan maintained the assessment rate schedules in place at the time and required the FDIC to update its analysis and projections for the deposit insurance fund balance and reserve ratio at least semiannually. In the semiannual update for the Restoration Plan in June 2022, the FDIC projected that the reserve ratio was at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028, the statutory deadline to restore the reserve ratio. \u00a0Based on this update, the FDIC Board approved an Amended Restoration Plan, and concurrently proposed an increase in initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by two basis points, applicable to all insured depository institutions. In October 2022, the FDIC Board finalized the increase with an effective date of January 1, 2023, applicable to the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The revised assessment rate schedules are intended to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the DIF reaches the statutory minimum level of 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028. Revised assessment rate schedules will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds two percent, absent further action by the FDIC Board. A significant increase in insurance premiums or a special assessment levied by the FDIC could likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank.\u00a0There can be no prediction as to what changes in insurance assessment rates may be made in the future. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, the Bank\u2019s FDIC deposit insurance premiums totaled $534,000. \nThe FDIC also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to take enforcement actions against banks and savings associations. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances which would result in termination of the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance.\nActivities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Financial Institutions.\n Federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (1) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (2) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank\u2019s total assets, (3) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors\u2019, trustees\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance coverage or bankers\u2019 blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions and (4) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution owned by another FDIC-insured institution if certain requirements are met.\nWashington State has enacted a law regarding financial institution parity. Primarily, the law affords Washington state-chartered commercial banks the same powers as Washington state-chartered savings banks and provides that Washington state-chartered commercial banks may exercise any of the powers that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to the business of banking and the powers of national banks, subject to the approval of the Director of the WDFI in certain situations. Finally, the law provides additional flexibility for Washington state-chartered commercial and savings banks with respect to interest rates on loans and other extensions of credit. Specifically, they may charge the maximum interest rate allowable for loans and other extensions of credit by federally-chartered financial institutions to Washington residents.\n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTransactions with Affiliates.\n\u00a0Riverview and the Bank are separate and distinct legal entities. The Bank is an affiliate of Riverview and any non-bank subsidiary of Riverview, federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in certain transactions with their affiliates. Transactions deemed to be a \u201ccovered transaction\u201d under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act between a bank and an affiliate are limited to 10% of a bank\u2019s capital and surplus and, with respect to all affiliates, to an aggregate of 20% of a bank\u2019s capital and surplus. Further, covered transactions that are loans and extensions of credit generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. Federal law also requires that covered transactions and certain other transactions listed in Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act between a bank and its affiliates be on terms as favorable to a bank as transactions with non-affiliates.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act.\n The Bank is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (\u201cCRA\u201d), which require the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency to assess a bank\u2019s performance under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by the Bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency\u2019s assessment of the Bank\u2019s record is made available to the public. Further, a bank\u2019s CRA performance must be considered in connection with a bank\u2019s application, to among other things, establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. An unsatisfactory rating may be the basis for denial of certain applications. The Bank received a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating during its most recent CRA examination.\nOn May 5, 2022, the federal bank regulatory agencies overhauled the CRA and jointly issued a proposal to strengthen and modernize regulations implementing the CRA. \u00a0The proposed regulations included major changes from the current regulation and will be effective on the first day of the first calendar quarter that begins at least 60 days after the publication date of the final rules. The new rules as proposed are intended to, (1) provide expanded access to credit, investment, and basic banking services in low- and moderate-income communities, (2) address changes in the banking industry, including internet and mobile banking, (3) yield greater clarity, consistency, and transparency, (4) tailor CRA evaluations and data collection to bank size and type, and (5) maintain a unified approach amongst the regulating agencies.\nDividends.\n The amount of dividends payable by the Bank to Riverview depends upon the Bank\u2019s earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies. Under Washington law, the Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on its capital stock if it would cause its net worth to be reduced below (1) the amount required for liquidation accounts or (2) the net worth requirements, if any, imposed by the Director of the WDFI. In addition, dividends may not be declared or paid if the Bank is in default in payment of any assessments due to the FDIC. Dividends on the Bank\u2019s capital stock may not be paid in an aggregate amount greater than the aggregate retained earnings of the Bank, without the approval of the Director of the WDFI.\nThe amount of dividends actually paid during any one period is affected by the Bank\u2019s policy of maintaining a strong capital position. Federal law further restricts dividends payable by an institution that does not meet the capital conservation buffer requirement and provides that no insured depository institution may pay a cash dividend if it would cause the institution to be \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments are deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice.\nStandards for Safety and Soundness.\n Each federal banking agency, including the FDIC, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems; loan documentation; credit underwriting; interest rate risk exposure; asset growth; asset quality; earnings; and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder. If the FDIC determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines, it may require an institution to submit to the FDIC an acceptable plan to achieve compliance. Management of the Bank is not aware of any conditions relating to these safety and soundness standards which would require submission of a plan of compliance.\nFederal Reserve System.\n The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts, primarily checking accounts. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced \n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nreserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on March 26, 2020, to support lending to households and businesses. At March 31, 2023, the Bank was not required to maintain any reserve balances.\nThe Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\u2019s \u201cdiscount window.\u201d An eligible institution need not exhaust other sources of funds before going to the discount window, nor are there restrictions on the purposes for which the institution can use primary credit. At March 31, 2023, the Bank had no outstanding borrowings from the Federal Reserve.\nCommercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations\n. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance directs the FDIC and other federal bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk:\n\u25cf\nTotal reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the bank\u2019s capital; or\n\u25cf\nTotal commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) represent 300% or more of the bank\u2019s total capital or the outstanding balance of the bank\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months.\nThe guidance provides that the strength of an institution\u2019s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy.\nEnvironmental Issues Associated with Real Estate Lending.\n The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present \u201cowners and operators\u201d of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term \u201cowner and operator\u201d excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this \u201csecured creditor exemption\u201d has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan. To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including the Bank, that have made loans secured by properties with potentially hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which could substantially exceed the value of the collateral property.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification.\n The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (\u201cUSA PATRIOT Act\u201d) was signed into law on October 26, 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts, and, effective in 2018, the beneficial owners of accounts. Bank regulators are directed to consider a holding company\u2019s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on Bank Holding Company Act and Bank Merger Act applications.\nPrivacy Standards and Cybersecurity.\n The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 modernized the financial services industry by establishing a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms and other financial service providers. \u00a0Federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of the board of directors. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services. These regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of its information sharing practices and informing consumers of their rights to opt out of certain practices.\u00a0In addition, Washington State and other federal and state cybersecurity and data privacy laws and regulations may expose the Bank to risk and result in certain risk management costs. In addition, on November 18, 2021, the federal banking agencies announced the adoption of a final rule providing for new \n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\nnotification requirements for banking organizations and their service providers for significant cybersecurity incidents. Specifically, the new rule requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator as soon as possible, and no later than 36 hours after, the banking organization determines that a \u201ccomputer-security incident\u201d rising to the level of a \u201cnotification incident\u201d has occurred. Notification is required for incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the viability of a banking organization\u2019s operations, its ability to deliver banking products and services, or the stability of the financial sector. Service providers are required under the rule to notify affected banking organization customers as soon as possible when the provider determines that it has experienced a computer-security incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the banking organization\u2019s customers for four or more hours. Compliance with the new rule was required by May 1, 2022. Non-compliance with federal or similar state privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations could lead to substantial regulatory imposed fines and penalties, damages from private causes of action and/or reputational harm\nOther Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations.\n The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) and empowered it to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a financial institution with assets of less than $10 billion, the Bank is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC with respect to its compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations.\nThe Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages and the loss of certain contractual rights.\nRegulation and Supervision of Riverview Bancorp, Inc.\nGeneral.\n Riverview as sole shareholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve. Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (\u201cBHCA\u201d), and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, Riverview is required to file semi-annual reports with the Federal Reserve and provide additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may examine Riverview, and any of its subsidiaries, and charge Riverview for the cost of the examination. The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Riverview, as a public company, is also required to file certain reports and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC. See \u201cFederal Securities Laws\u201d below.\nThe Bank Holding Company Act.\n Under the BHCA, Riverview is supervised by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act and earlier Federal Reserve policy provide that a bank holding company should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank by having the ability to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary bank during periods of financial distress to the bank. A bank holding company\u2019s failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve\u2019s regulations or both. No regulations have yet been proposed by the Federal Reserve to implement the source of strength provisions required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Riverview and any subsidiaries that it may control are considered \u201caffiliates\u201d within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between the Bank and affiliates are subject to numerous restrictions. With some exceptions, Riverview and its \n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\nsubsidiaries are prohibited from tying the provision of various services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by Riverview or by its affiliates.\nAcquisitions.\n\u00a0 The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. Under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve may approve the ownership of shares by a bank holding company in any company, the activities of which the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. These activities include: operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers\u2019 checks and U.S. Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. The Federal Reserve must approve the acquisition (or acquisition of control) of a bank or other FDIC-insured depository institution by a bank holding company, and the appropriate federal banking regulator must approve a bank\u2019s acquisition (or acquisition of control) of another bank or other FDIC-insured institution.\nAcquisition of Control of a Bank Holding Company.\n Under federal law, a notice or application must be submitted to the appropriate federal banking regulator if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire \u201ccontrol\u201d of a bank holding company. An acquisition of control can occur upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting stock of a bank holding company or as otherwise defined by federal regulations. In considering such a notice or application, the Federal Reserve takes into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that acquires control becomes subject to regulation as a bank holding company. Depending on circumstances, a notice or application may be required to be filed with appropriate state banking regulators and may be subject to their approval or non-objection.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements.\nAs discussed above, pursuant to the \u201cSmall Bank Holding Company\u201d exception, effective August 30, 2018, bank holding companies with less than $3 billion in consolidated assets were generally no longer subject to the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital regulations, which are generally the same as the capital regulations applicable to the Bank. At the time of this change, Riverview was considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d as defined for a bank holding company\u00a0with a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or more and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, and was not subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which the Federal Reserve requires it to maintain a specific capital level.\nRestrictions on Dividends.\n The Federal Reserve\n\u00a0\nhas issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies which expresses its view that a bank holding company must maintain an adequate capital position and generally should not pay cash dividends unless the company\u2019s net income for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the cash dividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the company\u2019s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends.\n\u00a0\nUnder Washington corporate law, Riverview generally may not pay dividends if after that payment it would not be able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business, or its total assets would be less than its total liabilities. The capital conservation buffer requirement may also limit or preclude dividends payable by the Company. For additional information, see Item 1.A. \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Risks Related to Regulatory and Compliance Matters \u2013 Non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions\u201d in this report.\n\u200b\n30\n\n\nTable of Contents\nStock Repurchases.\n A bank holding company, except for certain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d and highly rated bank holding companies, is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated net worth.\n\u00a0\nThe Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve.\nFederal Securities Laws.\n Riverview\u2019s common stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d). The Company is subject to information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act.\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n31\n\n\nTable of Contents",
    "item1a": ">Item 1A.\u00a0 Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, \nother \nrisks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u00a0The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks below also include forward-looking statements. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nOur business may be adversely affected by downturns in the national and the regional economies on which we depend.\nSubstantially all of our loans are to businesses and individuals in the states of Washington and Oregon. A decline in the economies of the seven counties in which we operate, including the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area, which we consider to be our primary market area, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Weakness in the global economy and global supply chain issues have adversely affected many businesses operating in our markets that are dependent upon international trade. Changes in agreements or relationships between the U.S. and other countries may also affect these businesses.\nA deterioration in economic conditions in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u25cf\nwe may increase our allowance for loan losses;\n\u25cf\ndemand for our products and services may decline possibly resulting in a decrease in our total loans or assets;\n\u25cf\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers\u2019 future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans;\n\u25cf\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; and\n\u25cf\nthe amount of our low-cost or non-interest bearing deposits may decrease.\n\u200b\nMany of the loans in our portfolio are secured by real estate. A decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are geographically diverse. Deterioration in the real estate markets where collateral for a mortgage loan is located could negatively affect the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan. Real estate values are affected by various other factors, including changes in general or regional economic conditions, governmental rules or policies and natural disasters such as earthquakes and tornadoes. If we are required to liquidate a significant amount of collateral during a period of reduced real estate values, our financial condition and profitability could be adversely affected.\nInflationary pressures and rising prices may affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u200b\nInflation has risen sharply since the end of 2021 to levels not seen in more than 40 years. Small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more during periods of high inflation as they are not able to leverage economies of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of our business customers to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a prolonged period of inflation could cause wages and other costs to the Company to increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u200b\nRisks Related to our Lending Activities\nOur real estate construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and the value of the completed project, and as with land loans may be more difficult to liquidate, if necessary.\nWe make construction and land loans primarily to builders to finance the construction of single and multifamily homes, subdivisions, as well as commercial properties, a portion of which are originated whether or not the collateral property underlying \n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\nthe loan is under contract for sale. At March 31, 2023, real estate construction and land loans totaled $54.2 million, or 5.37% of our total loan portfolio, and was comprised of $18.2 million of speculative and presold construction loans, $6.4 million of land loans and $29.6 million of commercial/multi-family construction loans.\nIn general, construction and land lending involve additional risks when compared with other lending because of the inherent difficulty in estimating a property\u2019s value both before and at completion of the project, as well as the estimated cost of the project and the time needed to sell the property at completion. Construction costs may exceed original estimates as a result of increased materials, labor or other costs. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. Changes in the demand, such as for new housing and higher than anticipated building costs may cause actual results to vary significantly from those estimated. For these reasons, this type of lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. A downturn in housing, or the real estate market, could increase loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures, and significantly impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. Some of our builders have more than one loan outstanding with us and also have residential mortgage loans for rental properties with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss.\nConstruction loans often involve the disbursement of funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. Moreover, during the term of most of our construction loans, no payment from the borrower is required since the accumulated interest is added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve. If our appraisal of the value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. Because construction loans require active monitoring of the building process, including cost comparisons and on-site inspections, these loans are more difficult and costly to monitor.\nIncreases in market rates of interest also may have a more pronounced effect on construction loans by rapidly increasing the end-purchasers\u2019 borrowing costs, thereby reducing the overall demand for the project. Properties under construction are often difficult to sell and typically must be completed in order to be successfully sold which also complicates the process of working out problem construction loans. This may require us to advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder to complete construction. Furthermore, in the case of speculative construction loans, there is the added risk associated with identifying an end-purchaser for the finished project. \nLoans on land under development or raw land held for future construction, including lot loans made to individuals for the future construction of a residence also pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral. These risks can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions. As a result, this type of lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to develop, sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to independently repay principal and interest. There were no non-performing real estate construction and land loans at March 31, 2023. A material increase in non-performing real estate construction and land loans could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. \nCommercial and multi-family real estate lending involves higher risks than real estate one-to-four family and other consumer lending, which exposes us to increased lending risks.\nWhile commercial and multi-family real estate lending is typically more profitable than real estate one-to-four family lending, it is generally more sensitive to regional and local economic conditions, making loss levels more difficult to predict. Collateral evaluation and financial statement analysis in these types of loans requires a more detailed analysis at the time of loan underwriting and on an ongoing basis. At March 31, 2023, we had $620.3 million of commercial and multi-family real estate loans, representing 61.49% of our total loan portfolio.\nCommercial and multi-family real estate loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans and some of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential loan. Repayment on these loans is dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be \n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\nadversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. For example, if the cash flow from the borrower\u2019s project is reduced as a result of leases not being obtained or renewed, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Commercial and multi-family mortgage loans also expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by one-to-four family residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be sold as easily as residential real estate. In addition, many of our commercial and multi-family real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. Such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment.\nA secondary market for most types of commercial real estate and multi-family loans is not readily liquid, so we have less opportunity to mitigate credit risk by selling part or all of our interest in these loans. As a result of these characteristics, if we foreclose on a commercial or multi-family real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Accordingly, charge-offs on commercial and multi-family real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios.\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property and declining property values.\nAt March 31, 2023, $99.7 million, or 9.88% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of real estate one-to-four family loans and home equity loans. Our first-lien real estate one-to-four family loans are primarily made based on the repayment ability of the borrower and the collateral securing these loans. Home equity lines of credit generally entail greater risk than do real estate one-to-four family loans where we are in the first-lien position. For those home equity lines secured by a second mortgage, it is less likely that we will be successful in recovering all of our loan proceeds in the event of default. Our foreclosure on these loans requires that the value of the property be sufficient to cover the repayment of the first mortgage loan, as well as the costs associated with foreclosure. \nThis type of lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. A downturn in the economy or the housing market in our market areas or a rapid increase in interest rates may reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans and increase the risk that we would incur losses if borrowers default on their loans. Residential loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios generally will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers sell their homes, the borrowers may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds. As a result, these loans may experience higher rates of delinquencies, defaults and losses, which will in turn adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \nRepayment of our commercial business loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value.\nAt March 31, 2023, commercial business loans totaled $232.9 million, or 23.08% of total loans. Our commercial business loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The borrowers\u2019 cash flow may be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. This collateral may consist of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, or other business assets. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. Other collateral securing loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise, may be illiquid and may fluctuate in value based on the specific type of business and equipment. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself which, in turn, is often dependent in part upon general economic conditions and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio. Future additions to our allowance for loan losses, as well as charge-offs in excess of reserves, will reduce our earnings.\nLending money is a substantial part of our business and each loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe cash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed;\n\u25cf\nin the case of a collateralized loan, the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral;\n\u25cf\nthe duration of the loan;\n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nthe credit history of a particular borrower; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in economic and industry conditions.\n\u200b\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which we believe is appropriate to provide for probable losses in our loan portfolio. The amount of this allowance is determined by management through periodic reviews and consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nour general reserve, based on our historical default and loss experience and certain macroeconomic factors based on management\u2019s expectations of future events;\n\u25cf\nour specific reserve, based on our evaluation of impaired loans and their underlying collateral or discounted cash flow; and\n\u25cf\nan unallocated reserve to provide for other credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the other loss factors.\n\u200b\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. If our estimates are incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in the need for increases in our allowance for loan losses through the provision for losses on loans which is charged against income. Deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may also require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Additionally, pursuant to our growth strategy, management recognizes that significant new growth in loan portfolios, new loan products and the refinancing of existing loans can result in portfolios comprised of unseasoned loans that may not perform in a historical or projected manner and will increase the risk that our allowance may be insufficient to absorb losses without significant additional provisions. \u00a0Further, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination.\nIn addition, the FASB has adopted an accounting standard referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, which requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for credit losses only when they have been incurred and are probable, which is expected to require us to adjust our allowance for loan losses and greatly increase the types of data we need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. This accounting pronouncement is applicable to us effective April 1, 2023. As of the adoption and day one measurement date of April 1, 2023, the Company expects to record a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings, net of income taxes, on the consolidated balance sheet. Also, as required by CECL, the Company reviewed the held-to-maturity debt securities portfolio and determined the expected losses were immaterial. The magnitude of the change in the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses at the adoption date will depend upon the nature and characteristics of the portfolio at the adoption date, as well as macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that time, other management judgements, and continued refinement and validation of the model and methodologies. See also, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements contained in Item 8 of this report. The federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three- year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital. \nAny increases in the provision for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital.\nRisks Related to Market and Interest Rate Changes\nChanges in interest rates may reduce our net interest income and may result in higher defaults in a rising rate environment.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income, which is the difference, or spread, between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Since March 2022, in response to inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d) of the Federal Reserve has increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 475 basis points, including 50 basis points during the first quarter of 2023, to a range of 4.75% to 5.00% as of March 31, 2023. In May 2023, the FOMC increased the target range for the federal funds rate another 25 basis \n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\npoints to a range of 5.00% to 5.25%. If the FOMC further increases the targeted federal funds rates, overall interest rates will likely continue to rise, which will positively impact our net interest income but may negatively impact the housing market by reducing refinancing activity, new home purchases and the U.S. economy. In addition, as previously discussed, inflationary pressures will increase our operational costs and could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of collateral securing loans which could negatively affect our financial performance. \nWe principally manage interest rate risk by managing our volume and mix of our earning assets and funding liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. In a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to manage this risk effectively. If we are unable to manage interest rate risk effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.\nChanges in interest rates could also have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations or by reducing our margins and profitability. Our net interest margin is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding. Changes in interest rates\u2014up or down\u2014could adversely affect our net interest margin and, as a result, our net interest income. Although the yields we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. Our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates. As a result, when interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets, causing our net interest margin to contract until the yield catches up. Changes in the slope of the \u201cyield curve\u201d\u2014or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates\u2014could also reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. Because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, when the yield curve flattens or even inverts, we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. Also, interest rate decreases can lead to increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk as we may have to redeploy such repayment proceeds into lower yielding investments, which would likely hurt our income.\nA sustained increase in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings. A significant portion of our loans have fixed interest rates and longer terms than our deposits and borrowings. As is the case with many financial institutions, our emphasis on increasing the development of core deposits, those deposits bearing no or a relatively low rate of interest with no stated maturity date, has resulted in our having a significant amount of these deposits which have a shorter duration than our assets. At March 31, 2023, we had $404.9 million in non-interest bearing demand deposits and $84.6 million in certificates of deposit that mature within one year. We would incur a higher cost of funds to retain these deposits in a rising interest rate environment. Our net interest income could be adversely affected if the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings increase more rapidly than the rates we earn on loans. In addition, a substantial amount of our home equity lines of credit have adjustable interest rates. As a result, these loans may experience a higher rate of default in a rising interest rate environment.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of our securities portfolio. Generally, the fair value of fixed-rate securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity, net of tax. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on stockholders\u2019 equity. At March 31, 2023, we recorded an $18.3 million accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is reflected as a reduction to stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations, any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our consolidated balance sheet or projected operating results. See Item 7A., \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nWe may incur losses on our securities portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates.\nFactors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect to the \n36\n\n\nTable of Contents\nsecurities, defaults by, or other adverse events affecting, the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. There can be no assurance that the declines in market value will not result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, and would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, we did not incur any other-than-temporary impairments on our securities portfolio.\nRevenue from broker loan fees is sensitive to changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, a slowdown in the housing market, higher interest rates or new legislation which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur mortgage brokerage operations provide additional non-interest income. The Company employs commissioned brokers who originate mortgage loans (including construction loans) for various mortgage companies. The loans brokered to mortgage companies are closed in the name of, and funded by, the purchasing mortgage company and are not originated as an asset of the Company. In return, the Company receives a fee ranging from 1.5% to 2.0% of the loan amount that it shares with the commissioned broker. The prevailing interest rate environment has a strong influence on the loan volume and amount of fees generated from our mortgage brokerage activity. In general, during periods of rising interest rates, the volume of loans and the amount of brokered loan fees included in non-interest income generally decrease as a result of slower mortgage loan demand. Conversely, during periods of falling interest rates, the volume of loans and the amount of brokered loan fees generally increase as a result of the increased mortgage loan demand. \nA general decline in economic conditions may adversely affect the fees generated by our asset management company.\nTo the extent our asset management clients and their assets become adversely affected by weak economic and stock market conditions, they may choose to withdraw the amount of assets managed by us and the value of their assets may decline. Our asset management revenues are based on the value of the assets we manage. If our clients withdraw assets or the value of their assets decline, the revenues generated by the Trust Company will be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal and Compliance Matters\nThe continued focus on increasing our commercial real estate loan portfolio may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny.\nThe FDIC, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under this guidance, a financial institution that, like us, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if, among other factors (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total capital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multi-family and non-farm residential properties, loans for construction, land development and other land, and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to commercial real estate related entities, represent 300% or more of total capital. Based on these criteria, the Bank determined that it did not have a concentration in commercial real estate lending as total loans for multifamily, non-farm/non-residential, construction, land development and other land represented 285% of total risk-based capital at March 31, 2023. The particular focus of the guidance is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be at greater risk to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance states that management should employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing.\n \nWhile we believe we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to our commercial real estate loan portfolio consistent with this guidance, bank regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures consistent with their interpretation of the guidance that may result in additional costs to us.\n37\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to benefit a company\u2019s shareholders. These regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on operations.\u00a0Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution\u2019s allowance for loan losses. These bank regulators also have the ability to impose conditions in the approval of merger and acquisition transactions. The significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described under the heading \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation\u201d in Item I of this Form 10-K. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. Any new regulations or legislation, change in existing regulations or oversight, whether a change in regulatory policy or a change in a regulator\u2019s interpretation of a law or regulation, may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against us may lead to penalties that materially affect us. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent registered public accounting firm. These accounting changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of our operations as could our interpretation of those changes.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to get regulatory approval of acquisitions.\nThe USA PATRIOT Act and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to get regulatory approval of acquisitions. Recently, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf our enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating risk and loss to us, we could suffer unexpected losses and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, which is critical to optimizing shareholder value. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, analyze and control the types of risk to which we are subject. These risks include, among others, liquidity, credit, market, interest rate, operational, legal and compliance, and reputational risk. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. We also maintain a compliance program to identify, measure, assess, and report on our adherence to applicable laws, policies and procedures. While we assess and improve these programs on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that our risk management or compliance programs, along with other related controls, will effectively mitigate risk under all circumstances, or that it will adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as they may exist, or develop in the future, including risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe effects of climate change continue to create an alarming level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, the global business community has increased its political and social awareness surrounding the issue, and the United States has entered into international agreements in an attempt to reduce global temperatures, such as reentering the Paris Agreement. Further, \n38\n\n\nTable of Contents\nthe U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continue to propose numerous initiatives to supplement the global effort to combat climate change. Similar and even more expansive initiatives are expected under the current administration, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks\u2019 risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. The lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change render it difficult, or even impossible, to predict how specifically climate change may impact our financial condition and results of operations; however, the physical effects of climate change may also directly impact us. Specifically, unpredictable and more frequent weather disasters may adversely impact the real property, and/or the value of the real property, securing the loans in our portfolios. Additionally, if insurance obtained by our borrowers is insufficient to cover any losses sustained to the collateral, or if insurance coverage is otherwise unavailable to our borrowers, the collateral securing our loans may be negatively impacted by climate change, natural disasters and related events, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the effects of climate change may negatively impact regional and local economic activity, which could lead to an adverse effect on our customers and impact the communities in which we operate. Overall, climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Data and Fraud\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology.\nOur security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber-attack\n. Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger and virtually all other aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, fraudulent or unauthorized access, denial or degradation of service attacks, misuse, computer viruses, malware or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, this could jeopardize our or our customers\u2019 confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or counterparties. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. We could also suffer significant reputational damage.\nFurther, our cardholders use their debit and credit cards to make purchases from third parties or through third-party processing services. As such, we are subject to risk from data breaches of such third-party\u2019s information systems or their payment processors. Such a data security breach could compromise our account information. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for losses associated with reimbursing our clients for such fraudulent transactions on clients\u2019 card accounts, as well as costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. We may also incur other costs related to data security breaches, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs.\nBreaches of information security also may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or our clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential information, including employees. The Company is continuously working to install new and upgrade its existing information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to further protect the Company against cyber risks and security breaches.\nThere continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for \n39\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncompanies, including ours. We are not aware that we have experienced any material misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as a result of a cyber-security breach or other act, however, some of our clients may have been affected by third-party breaches, which could increase their risks of identity theft, credit card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us.\nSecurity breaches in our internet banking activities could further expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation\n. Increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients and underlying transactions. Any compromise of our security could deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We rely on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. Although we have developed and continue to invest in systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, and could result in losses to us or our clients, our loss of business and/or clients, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, disruption to our business, our inability to grow our online services or other businesses, additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties, or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur security measures may not protect us from system failures or interruptions\n. While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, we outsource certain aspects of our data processing and other operational functions to certain third-party providers. While the Company selects third-party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, including\u00a0those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher transaction volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches or if we otherwise have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business operations could be adversely impacted. Replacing these third-party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nWe cannot assure that such breaches, failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed by us or the third parties on which we rely. We may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third-party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from breaches, system failures or other disruptions. If any of our third-party service providers experience financial, operational or technological difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them, we may be required to identify alternative sources of such services, and we cannot assure that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Further, the occurrence of any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to legal liability. Any of these occurrences could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe board of directors oversees the risk management process, including the risk of cybersecurity, and engages with management on cybersecurity issues.\nOur business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes.\nAs a bank, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. We have also experienced losses due to apparent fraud and other financial crimes. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses, there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur.\n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Accounting Matters\nThe Company\u2019s reported financial results depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates, which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment regarding the most appropriate manner to report the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances, yet might result in the Company\u2019s reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting estimates include, but are not limited to the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of investment securities, goodwill valuation and the calculation of income taxes, including tax provisions and realization of deferred tax assets; and the fair value of assets and liabilities. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, the Company may be required, among other things, to significantly increase the allowance for loan losses, sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided, and/or record a write-off of goodwill as a result of impairment. \u00a0For more information, refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d contained in this Form 10-K.\n \nWe may experience future goodwill impairment, which could reduce our earnings.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2022, and the test concluded that recorded goodwill was not impaired. Our assessment of the fair value of goodwill is based on an evaluation of current purchase transactions, discounted cash flows from forecasted earnings, our current market capitalization, and a valuation of our assets. Our evaluation of the fair value of goodwill involves a substantial amount of judgment. If our judgment was incorrect, or if events or circumstances change, and an impairment of goodwill was deemed to exist, we would be required to write down our goodwill resulting in a charge to earnings, which would adversely affect our results of operations, perhaps materially; however, it would have no impact on our liquidity, operations or regulatory capital. We performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill at March 31, 2023 and concluded that recorded goodwill was not impaired. Our test of goodwill for potential impairment is based on a qualitative assessment by management that takes into consideration macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost or margin factors, financial performance and share price.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry General\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe rely on numerous external vendors to provide us with products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements because of changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason, could be disruptive to our operations, which in turn could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We also could be adversely affected to the extent such an agreement is not renewed by the third-party vendor or is renewed on terms less favorable to us. Additionally, the bank regulatory agencies expect financial institutions to be responsible for all aspects of our vendors\u2019 performance, including aspects which they delegate to third parties. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and clients, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our clients use to access our products and services could result in client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe will be required to transition from the use of LIBOR in the future.\nWe have junior subordinated debentures indexed to LIBOR to calculate the interest rate. ICE Benchmark Administration, the authorized and regulated administrator of LIBOR, \u00a0ended publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) LIBOR tenors on December 31, 2021 and the remaining USD LIBOR tenors will end publication in June 2023. Financial services regulators and industry groups have collaborated to develop alternate reference rate indices or reference rates. The transition to a new reference rate requires changes to contracts, risk and pricing models, valuation tools, systems, product design and hedging strategies. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR (with the exception of overnight repurchase agreements, which are expected to be based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR). The language in our LIBOR-based contracts and financial instruments has developed over time and may have various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. If a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments may give the calculation agent discretion over the substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates to be selected. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our agreements may result in incurring significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if the substitute index or indices is not accepted and may result in disputes or litigation with customers and creditors over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIneffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. Our primary sources of liquidity are increases in deposit accounts, cash flows from loan payments and our securities portfolio. Borrowings also provide us with a source of funds to meet liquidity demands. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans or investment securities, or other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically, or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the Washington or Oregon markets in which our loans are concentrated, negative operating results, or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry or deterioration in credit markets. Any decline in available funding in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdraw demands, any of which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nAdditionally, collateralized public funds are bank deposits of state and local municipalities. These deposits are required to be secured by certain investment grade securities to ensure repayment, which on the one hand tends to reduce our contingent liquidity risk by making these funds somewhat less credit sensitive, but on the other hand reduces standby liquidity by restricting the potential liquidity of the pledged collateral. Although these funds historically have been a relatively stable source of funds for us, availability depends on the individual municipality\u2019s fiscal policies and cash flow needs.\nOur branching strategy may cause our expenses to increase faster than revenues.\nSince June 2020, we opened three new branches in Clark County, Washington and may open additional branches in our market area in the future. The success of our branch expansion strategy is contingent upon numerous factors, such as our ability to secure managerial resources, hire and retain qualified personnel and implement effective marketing strategies. The opening of new branches may not increase the volume of our loans and deposits as quickly or to the degree that we hope and opening new branches will increase our operating expenses. On average, de novo branches do not become profitable until three to four years after opening. Further, the projected timeline and the estimated dollar amounts involved in opening de novo branches could differ significantly from actual results. We may not successfully manage the costs and implementation risks associated with our branching strategy. Accordingly, any new branch may negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branch reaches certain economies of scale. Finally, there is a risk that our new branches will not be successful even after they have been established.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any additional capital we obtain may result in the dilution of the interests of existing holders of our common stock. Further, if we are unable to raise additional capital when required by our bank regulators, we may be subject to adverse regulatory action.\nIf we fail to meet the expectations of our stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices, including those relating to sustainability, it may have an adverse effect on our reputation and results of operation. \u00a0\nOur reputation may also be negatively impacted by our diversity, equity and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d) efforts if they fall short of expectations. In addition, various private third-party organizations have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG and DEI matters. These ratings may be used by some investors to assist with their investment and voting decisions. Any unfavorable ratings may lead to reputational damage and negative sentiment among our investors and other stakeholders. Furthermore, increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and our stock price. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure.\nCompetition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability.\nAlthough we consider ourselves competitive in our market areas, we face intense competition in both making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in our earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which reduces net interest income. Some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability will depend upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market areas.\nOur ability to retain and recruit key management personnel and bankers is critical to the success of our business strategy and any failure to do so could impair our customer relationships and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nCompetition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of, and experience in, the community banking industry where the Bank conducts its business.\u00a0The process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, loan origination, finance, administrative, marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of our management and personnel.\u00a0In particular, our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of key executives, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, and certain other employees.\u00a0Our ability to retain and grow our loans, deposits, and fee income depends upon the business generation capabilities, reputation, and relationship management skills of our lenders. If we were to lose the services of any of our bankers, including successful bankers employed by banks that we may acquire, to a new or existing competitor, or otherwise, we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our customers could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services. In addition, our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the services of our directors, many of whom are at or nearing retirement age, and we may not be able to identify and attract suitable candidates to replace such directors.\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nManaging reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees.\nThreats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality or operational failures due to integration or conversion challenges as a result of acquisitions we undertake, compliance deficiencies, and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation.\nWe rely on dividends from the Bank for substantially all of our revenue at the holding company level.\nRiverview is a separate legal entity from \u00a0its subsidiaries and does not have significant operations of its own. The long-term ability of Riverview to pay dividends to its stockholders and debt payments is based primarily upon the ability of the Bank to make capital distributions to Riverview, and also on the availability of cash at the holding company level. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by the Bank\u2019s earnings and capital, as well as various statutes and regulations. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments on our outstanding debt. Consequently, the inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\n\u200b\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents",
    "item7": ">Item 7.\u00a0 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\u200b\nGeneral\n\u200b\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and the other sections contained in this Form 10-K. \n\u200b\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. \nThe Company has identified policies that due to the significant level of judgement, estimation and assumptions inherent in those policies are critical to an understanding of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These policies include our accounting policies related to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of investment securities and goodwill valuations. The following is a discussion of the critical accounting estimates involved with those accounting policies.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\n\u200b\nThe allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management because of the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses. The provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level based upon management\u2019s evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance for loan losses are: overall economic conditions; value of collateral; strength of guarantors; loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Based on the analysis of the allowance for loan losses, the amount of the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by a recapture of loan losses and are charged against current period earnings. \n\u200b\nThe allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for probable losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and upon our continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is comprised of a general component, a specific component and an unallocated component. The general component is based on historical loss experience applied to loan segments adjusted by qualitative factors. These qualitative factors include: lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices; national and local economic trends and conditions; nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff; volume and severity of past due, classified and non-accrual loans as well as other loan modifications; quality of the Company\u2019s loan review system; existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; changes in the value of underlying collateral; and other external factors. The specific component relates to loans that been evaluated for impairment because all contractual amounts of principal and interest will not be paid as scheduled. Based on this impairment analysis, a specific reserve may be established. An unallocated portion is established for uncertainties that may not be identified in either the general or specific component of the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is based upon factors and trends identified by us at the time financial statements are prepared. Although we use the best information available, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic, operating, regulatory and other conditions beyond our control. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n47\n\n\nTable of Contents\nValuation of Investment Securities. \n\u200b\nThe Company determines the estimated fair value of certain assets that are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established under GAAP. These Level 3 assets are valued using significant unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the estimated fair value of the assets. These Level 3 assets are certain loans measured for impairment for which there is neither an active market for identical assets from which to determine fair value, nor is there sufficient, current market information about similar assets to use as observable, corroborated data for all significant inputs in a valuation model. Under these circumstances, the estimated fair values of these assets are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, appraisals, and other valuation methods in accordance with accounting standards, for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nValuations using models or other techniques are dependent upon assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of the valuation date. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. Judgment is then applied in formulating those inputs.\nCertain loans included in the loan portfolio were deemed impaired at March 31, 2023. Accordingly, loans measured for impairment were classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as there is no active market for these loans. Measuring impairment of a loan requires judgment and estimates, and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates. Impairment was measured based on a number of factors, including recent independent appraisals which are further reduced for estimated selling costs or by estimating the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan\u2019s effective interest rate.\nFor additional information on our Level 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\u200b\nGoodwill Valuation\n\u200b\nGoodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested, at least annually, for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company has two reporting units, the Bank and the Trust Company, for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment. All of the Company\u2019s goodwill has been allocated to the Bank reporting unit. The Company performs an annual review in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indications of potential impairment exist, to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and additional analysis must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. Specifically, the Company would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, the Company would record an impairment charge for the difference.\nA significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and unanticipated competition. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2022. The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. Step one of the goodwill impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing the allocation of corporate value approach, the income approach, the whole bank transaction approach and the market approach in order to derive an enterprise value of the Company. The allocation of corporate value approach applies the aggregate market value of the Company and divides it among the reporting units. A key assumption in this approach is the control premium applied to the aggregate market value. A control premium is utilized as the value of a company from the perspective of a controlling interest is generally higher than the widely quoted market price per share. The Company used an expected control premium of 30%, which was based on comparable transactional history. The income approach uses a reporting unit\u2019s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a rate that reflects current market conditions. The projection uses management\u2019s best estimates of \n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\neconomic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in loans and deposits, estimates of future expected changes in net interest margins and cash expenditures. Assumptions used by the Company in its discounted cash flow model (income approach) included an annual revenue growth rate that approximated 2.0%, a net interest margin that approximated 3.7% and a return on assets that ranged from 1.22% to 1.30% (average of 1.26%). In addition to utilizing the above projections of estimated operating results, key assumptions used to determine the fair value estimate under the income approach were the discount rate of 18.33% utilized for our cash flow estimates and a terminal value estimated at 1.43 times the ending book value of the reporting unit. The Company used a build-up approach in developing the discount rate that included: an assessment of the risk-free interest rate, the rate of return expected from publicly traded stocks, the industry the Company operates in and the size of the Company. The whole bank transaction approach estimates fair value by applying key financial variables in transactions involving acquisitions of similar institutions. The market approach estimates fair value by applying tangible book value multiples to the reporting unit\u2019s operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting unit. In applying the market approach method, the Company selected four publicly traded comparable institutions. After selecting comparable institutions, the Company derived the fair value of the reporting unit by completing a comparative analysis of the relationship between their financial metrics listed above and their market values utilizing a market multiple of 1.0 times book value, a market multiple of 1.1 times tangible book value and an earnings multiple of 10 times. The Company calculated a fair value of its reporting unit of $192.0 million using the corporate value approach, $169.2 million using the income approach and $230.0 million using the market approach, with a final concluded value of $197.0 million, with equal weight given to the income approach, the market approach and the corporate value approach. The results of the Company\u2019s step one test indicated that the reporting unit\u2019s fair value was greater than its carrying value and therefore no impairment of goodwill exists.\nThe Company also completed a qualitative assessment of goodwill as of March 31, 2023 and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Bank (the reporting unit), exceeds its carrying value at that date. Even though the Company determined that there was no goodwill impairment, a sustained decline in the value of its stock price as well as values of other financial institutions, declines in revenue for the Company beyond our current forecasts, significant adverse changes in the operating environment for the financial industry or an increase in the value of our assets without an increase in the value of the reporting unit may result in a future impairment charge.\nIt is also possible that changes in circumstances existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, or in the numerous estimates associated with management\u2019s judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of our goodwill, could result in an impairment charge of a portion or all of our goodwill. If the Company recorded an impairment charge, its financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected; however, such an impairment charge would have no impact on our liquidity, operations or regulatory capital.\nFor additional information concerning critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" and the following:\nOperating Strategy and Selected Financial Information\nFiscal year 2024 marks the 100th anniversary for Riverview Bank, which opened for business in 1923. Our primary business strategy is to provide comprehensive banking and related financial services within our primary market area. The Company\u2019s goal is to deliver returns to shareholders by increasing higher-yielding assets (in particular, commercial real estate and commercial business loans), increasing core deposit balances, managing problem assets, reducing expenses, hiring experienced employees with a commercial lending focus and exploring expansion opportunities. The Company seeks to achieve these results by focusing on the following objectives:\nExecution of our Business Plan\n. The Company is focused on increasing its loan portfolio, especially higher yielding commercial and construction loans, and its core deposits by expanding its customer base throughout its primary market areas. While the Company historically emphasized residential real estate lending, since 1998 it has been diversifying its loan portfolio through the expansion of its commercial and construction loan portfolios. At March 31, 2023, commercial and construction loans represented 89.9% of total loans. Commercial lending, including commercial real estate loans, typically involves more credit risk than residential lending, justifying higher interest margins and fees on loans which can increase the loan portfolio\u2019s profitability. In addition, by emphasizing total relationship banking, the Company intends to deepen the relationships with its customers and increase individual customer profitability through cross-marketing programs, which allows the Company to better identify lending opportunities and services for customers. To build its core deposit base, the Company will continue to utilize additional product offerings, technology and a focus on customer service in working toward this goal. The Company will also continue to seek to expand its franchise through de novo branches, the selective acquisition of individual branches, loan purchases and whole bank \n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\ntransactions that meet its investment and market objectives. In this regard, the Company recently opened three new branches located in Clark County, Washington, to complement its existing branch network. \nMaintaining Strong Asset Quality\n. The Company believes that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. The Company has actively managed delinquent loans and nonperforming assets by aggressively pursuing the collection of consumer debts, marketing saleable properties upon foreclosure or repossession, and through work-outs of classified assets and loan charge-offs. The Company\u2019s approach to credit management uses well defined policies and procedures and disciplined underwriting criteria resulting in our strong asset quality and credit metrics in fiscal year 2023. Although the Company intends to prudently increase the percentage of its assets consisting of higher-yielding commercial real estate, real estate construction and commercial business loans, which offer higher risk-adjusted returns, shorter maturities and more sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, the Company intends to manage credit exposure through the use of experienced bankers in these areas and a conservative approach to its lending.\nIntroduction of New Products and Services\n. The Company continuously reviews new products and services to provide its customers more financial options. All new technology and services are generally reviewed for business development and cost saving purposes. The Company continues to experience growth in customer use of its online banking services, where the Bank provides a full array of traditional cash management products as well as online banking products including mobile banking, mobile deposit, bill pay, e-statements, and text banking. The products are tailored to meet the needs of small to medium size businesses and households in the markets we serve. The Company intends to selectively add other products to further diversify revenue sources and to capture more of each customer\u2019s banking relationship by cross selling loan and deposit products and additional services, including services provided through the Trust Company to increase its fee income. Assets under management by the Trust Company totaled $890.6 million and $1.3 billion at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The Company also offers a third-party identity theft product to its customers. The identity theft product assists our customers in monitoring their credit and includes an identity theft restoration service.\nAttracting Core Deposits and Other Deposit Products\n.\n The Company offers personal checking, savings and money-market accounts, which generally are lower-cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit and are less likely to be withdrawn when interest rates fluctuate. To build its core deposit base, the Company has sought to reduce its dependence on traditional higher cost deposits in favor of stable lower cost core deposits to fund loan growth and decrease its reliance on other wholesale funding sources, including brokered deposits, FHLB advances and FRB borrowings. The Company believes that its continued focus on building customer relationships will help to increase the level of core deposits and locally-based retail certificates of deposit. In addition, the Company intends to increase demand deposits by growing business banking relationships through expanded product lines tailored to meet its target business customers\u2019 needs. The Company maintains technology-based products to encourage the growth of lower cost deposits, such as personal financial management, business cash management, and business remote deposit products, that enable it to meet its customers\u2019 cash management needs and compete effectively with banks of all sizes. Core branch deposits decreased $250.1 million\u00a0at March 31, 2023 compared to March 31, 2022 due to deposit pricing pressures in our markets, resulting in the Company\u2019s use of higher costing FHLB advances during fiscal 2023. Core branch deposits accounted for 97.5% of total deposits at March 31, 2023 compared to 96.8% at March 31, 2022.\nRecruiting and Retaining Highly Competent Personnel with a Focus on Commercial Lending\n.\n The Company\u2019s ability to continue to attract and retain banking professionals with strong community relationships and significant knowledge of its markets will be a key to its success. The Company believes that it enhances its market position and adds profitable growth opportunities by focusing on hiring and retaining experienced bankers focused on owner occupied commercial real estate and commercial lending, and the deposit balances that accompany these relationships. The Company emphasizes to its employees the importance of delivering exemplary customer service and seeking opportunities to build further relationships with its customers. The goal is to compete with other financial service providers by relying on the strength of the Company\u2019s customer service and relationship banking approach. The Company believes that one of its strengths is that its employees are also shareholders through the Company\u2019s ESOP and 401(k) plans.\nSelected Financial Data:\n The following financial condition data as of March 31, 2023 and 2022 and operating data and key financial ratios for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 have been derived from the Company\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements.

$22.0 million at March 31, 2023 compared to $241.4 million at March 31, 2022. The Company\u2019s cash balances typically fluctuate based upon funding needs, deposit activity and investment securities purchases. Based on the Company\u2019s asset/liability management program and liquidity objectives, the Company may deploy a portion of excess cash balances to purchase investment securities depending on the rate environment and other considerations. As a part of this strategy, the Company also invests a portion of its excess cash in short-term certificates of deposit held for investment, all of which are fully insured by the FDIC. Certificates of deposits held for investment totaled $249,000 at both March 31, 2023 and 2022.\nInvestment securities totaled $\n455.3 \nmillion and $418.9 million at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase was due to investment purchases, partially offset by normal pay downs, calls and maturities.\u00a0During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, purchases of investment securities totaled $81.8 million and $224.6 million, respectively. The Company primarily purchases a combination of securities backed by government agencies (FHLMC, FNMA, SBA or GNMA). At March 31, 2023, the Company determined that none of its investment securities required an OTTI charge. In the third quarter of \u00a0fiscal \u00a02022, \u00a0the Company reassessed and transferred $85.8 million of U.S. government and agency securities from the available for sale classification to the held to maturity classification. The net unrealized after tax gain of $18,000 was deemed insignificant and the book balance of investment securities were transferred. No gains or losses were recognized at the time of the transfer. For additional information on the Company\u2019s investment securities, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\u200b\nLoans receivable, net, totaled $993.5 million at March 31, 2023, compared to $975.9 million at March 31, 2022, an increase of $17.6 million. The increase was primarily attributed to increases in real estate construction loans of $23.6 million, commercial business loans of $4.8 million and real estate one-to-four family loans of $17.7 million. The increases in commercial business loans and real estate one-to-four family loans were attributable to the purchase of $28.7 million and $26.8 million of such loans, respectively. These increases were partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate, multi-family and land loans of $18.3 million, $4.4 million and $5.1 million, respectively, since March 31, 2022. In addition, these increases were offset by a decrease in SBA PPP loans related to forgiveness repayments. At March 31, 2023, SBA PPP loans, net of deferred fees which are included in the commercial business loan category were insignificant compared to $3.1 million at March 31, 2022. \nThe Company no longer originates real estate one-to-four family loans and will from time to time purchase these loans consistent with its asset/liability objectives. Additionally, the Company will purchase commercial business loans to supplement loan originations and diversify the commercial loan portfolio. These loans were originated by a third-party located outside of the Company\u2019s primary market area and totaled $26.2 million and $14.7 million at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company also purchases the guaranteed portion of SBA loans as a way to supplement loan originations, to further diversify its loan portfolio and earn a higher yield than earned on its cash or short-term investments. These SBA loans are originated through another financial institution located outside of the Company\u2019s primary market area and are purchased with servicing retained by the seller. \u00a0At March 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s purchased SBA loan portfolio was $55.5 million compared to $59.4 million at March 31, 2022. \u00a0\nGoodwill was $27.1 million at both March 31, 2023 and 2022. For additional information on our goodwill impairment testing, see \u201cGoodwill Valuation\u201d included in this Item 7.\nPrepaid expenses and other assets increased $3.6 million to $16.0 million at March 31, 2023 compared to $12.4 million at March 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to a computer software contract for a new loan origination system that was executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. \nDeposits decreased $268.7 million to $1.3 billion at March 31, 2023 compared to $1.5 billion at March 31, 2022 due to increased competition, pricing and an overall decrease in market liquidity. The decrease in deposits was attributable to reductions in non-interest-bearing accounts of $89.9 million, regular savings accounts of $84.9 million, money market accounts of $78.0 million and interest checking of $33.3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $17.5 million in certificates of deposit. \u00a0The Company had no wholesale-brokered deposits at March 31, 2023 and 2022. Core branch deposits accounted for 97.5% of total deposits at March 31, 2023 compared to 96.8% at March 31, 2022. The Company plans to continue its focus on core deposits and on building customer relationships as opposed to obtaining deposits through the wholesale markets.\n53\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFHLB advances increased to $123.8 million at March 31, 2023 and were comprised of overnight advances and a short-term borrowing of $73.8 million and $50.0 million, respectively. There were no outstanding FHLB advances at March 31, 2022. These FHLB advances were utilized to offset the decrease in deposit balances.\nShareholders\u2019 equity decreased $2.0 million to $155.2 million at March 31, 2023 from $157.2 million at March 31, 2022. The decrease was mainly attributable to the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the change in unrealized holding losses on securities available for sale, net of tax, of $8.4 million, the repurchase of 975,666 shares of common stock totaling $6.7 million, and the payment of cash dividends totaling $5.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by net income of $18.1 million.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended March 31, 2023 and 2022\nNet Income.\n Net income was $18.1 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, compared to $21.8 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.\u00a0The Company\u2019s net income decreased primarily as a result of a provision for loan losses of $750,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 compared to a $4.6 million recapture of loan losses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. Non-interest expense increased to $39.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, compared to $36.7 million for the prior fiscal year as the Company recognized a $1.0 million gain on sale of premises and equipment during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, that was not present during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, as well as year over year increases in salary and employee benefits, occupancy and depreciation, and advertising and marketing expense. In addition,\n \nnon-interest income decreased $550,000 as a result of a decrease in fees and service charges and a $500,000 BOLI death benefit received during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 that was not present during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, partially offset by an increase in asset management fees.\nNet Interest Income.\n The Company\u2019s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between the income it receives on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. When the rate earned on interest-earning assets equals or exceeds the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, this positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income. The Company\u2019s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, government legislation and regulation, and monetary and fiscal policies.\nNet interest income for fiscal year 2023 increased $4.0 million, or 8.4%, to $51.6 million compared to $47.6 million in fiscal year 2022. The net interest margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 was 3.26% compared to 3.03% for the prior fiscal year. The increase in the net interest margin was primarily attributable to both the higher average balance and yield on investment securities compared to the legacy investment securities portfolios and an increase in the average yield on interest-bearing deposits in other banks balances between the periods reflecting the lagging benefit of variable rate interest-earning assets beginning to reprice higher following recent increases in market interest rates.\nInterest and Dividend Income.\n Interest and dividend income increased $5.8 million to $55.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 from $49.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. The increase was primarily related to the increase in interest income on the investment securities portfolio due to the overall increase in average balance of and yield on investment securities. Interest income on investment securities increased $3.8 million to $9.0 million at March 31, 2023 compared to $5.2 million at March 31, 2022. This increase was also attributable to the increase of $665,000 on interest and fees earned on loans receivable for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year due to the increase in the average balance of average net loans. The impact of the increase in the average net loans was offset by the decrease in the average yield on net loans by 28 basis points to 4.44% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, predominantly from higher deferred SBA PPP loan fees recognized from SBA PPP loans that were forgiven. SBA PPP loans had a favorable impact on our loan yields when SBA PPP loans are forgiven and the remaining deferred fees are recognized which increase the average net loan yield for fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 that were not present for the fiscal year-ended March 31, 2023. Interest and dividend income included $102,000 and $3.0 million of interest and fees related to SBA PPP loans for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \u00a0The average balance of overnight cash balances positively impacted interest and dividend income due to the average yield on interest-bearing deposits at other banks which increased 161 basis points for fiscal year 2023 to 1.76% compared to 0.15% for fiscal year 2022. \n\u200b\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\nInterest Expense.\n Interest expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 totaled $4.1 million, a $1.9 million or 84.5% increase from $2.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. The increase was primarily the result of an 18 basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate on interest-bearing liabilities and a $21.0 million increase in the average balance of FHLB advances for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year. The weighted average interest rate on interest-bearing deposits increased to 0.16% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 from 0.14% for the prior fiscal year. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits decreased $21.7 million to $965.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 compared to $987.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. Although the weighted average interest rate increased on interest-bearing deposits due to the overall increase in the interest rate environment, this increase was partially offset by the decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. \nInterest expense on borrowings increased $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the average balance of FHLB advances. The average balance of FHLB advances increased to $21.0 million for fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 compared to $3,000 for the same period in the prior year. The weighted average interest rate on FHLB advances increased to 4.88% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 compared to 0.31% for the prior fiscal year\n. The weighted average interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures increased 281 basis points to 5.09% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 compared to 2.28% for the prior fiscal year.\n\u200b\nProvision for Loan Losses.\n The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $750,000 and a recapture of loan losses of $4.6 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The provision for loan losses for the fiscal year 2023 was due to an isolated loan downgrade that affected the allowance for loan losses. The recapture of loan losses for fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to the improving economic conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic since March 31, 2021. Any future decline in national and local economic conditions could result in a material increase in the allowance for loan losses and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAt March 31, 2023, the Company had an allowance for loan losses of $15.3 million, or 1.52% of total loans, compared to $14.5 million, or 1.47% of total loans at March 31, 2022. Net recoveries were $36,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 compared to net charge-offs of $30,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. Net recoveries and net charge-offs to average net loans were insignificant for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nImpaired loans are subjected to an impairment analysis to determine an appropriate reserve amount to be held against each loan. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had identified $629,000 of impaired loans. Because the significant majority of the impaired loans are collateral dependent, nearly all of the specific allowances are calculated based on the estimated fair value of the collateral. Of those impaired loans, $534,000 have no specific valuation allowance as their estimated net collateral value is equal to or exceeds the carrying amount of the loan, which in some cases is the result of previous loan charge-offs. The remaining impaired loan of $95,000 has a specific valuation allowance of $6,000. Charge-offs on these impaired loans totaled $85,000 from their original loan balances. Based on a comprehensive analysis, management deemed the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at March 31, 2023. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses.\nNon-Interest Income.\n Non-interest income decreased $550,000 to $12.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 from $12.7 million for fiscal year 2022. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in fees and service charges related to a decrease in brokered loan fees of $723,000. \u00a0These decreases are partially offset by an increase in asset management fees of $627,000 due to an increase in custody fees of $930,000 and trust tax preparation fees of $76,000 partially offset by a decrease in irrevocable trust fees of $342,000 and agency fees of $126,000 during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. Additionally, non-interest income also included a BOLI death benefit on a former employee of $500,000 during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 that was not present for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. \n\u200b\n55\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNon-Interest Expense.\n Non-interest expense increased $2.7 million to $39.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2023 from $36.7 million for fiscal year 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $347,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year and was mainly due to wage pressures, and the competitive landscape for attracting and retaining employees in the Company\u2019s primary market. Additionally, occupancy and depreciation expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 increased mainly due to an increase in rent expense, depreciation expense and repair and maintenance expense as the Company continues to update and modernize certain branch locations. In addition, the increase in non-interest expense is due to the recognition of a $1.0 million gain on sale of premises and equipment related to a former branch building during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, that was not present in the current fiscal year. Advertising and marketing expense increased $309,000 due to additional sponsorships and events as our local economy began to reopen when compared to the prior fiscal year. FDIC insurance premium expense increased $95,000 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increased FDIC assessment rate. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in data processing expense of $218,000 for fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year due to a decreased cost associated with our core banking platform. \nIncome Taxes.\n The provision for income taxes was $5.6 million and $6.5 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was due to lower pre-tax income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. The effective tax rate was 23.7% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 compared to 22.8% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. The effective tax rate may be affected by the effects of apportioned income for state and local jurisdictions where we do business. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 was lower than its historical effective tax rate due to a non-taxable BOLI death benefit of $500,000 that was not present for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. At March 31, 2023, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $10.3 million. As of March 31, 2023, management deemed that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the Company\u2019s deferred tax asset was not necessary. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company\u2019s income taxes.\n\u200b\n56\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAverage Balance Sheet\n. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income earned on average interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on average interest-bearing liabilities, resultant yields, interest rate spread, ratio of interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities and net interest margin.

Information is provided with respect to: (i) effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) changes in rate/volume (change in rate multiplied by change in volume). Variances that were insignificant have been allocated based upon the percentage relationship of changes in volume and changes in rate to the total net change (in thousands).

The Company has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the difference between asset and liability maturities and interest rates. The principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the Company\u2019s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate sensitivity increases by originating and purchasing portfolio loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions and fixed rate loans with shorter terms to maturity. The Company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds, but also has access to FHLB advances, FRB borrowings, and other wholesale facilities, as needed. Management believes retail deposits reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a stable source of funds. As part of its interest rate risk management strategy, the Company promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms up to ten years.\nThe Company has adopted a strategy that is designed to maintain or improve the interest rate sensitivity of assets relative to its liabilities. The primary elements of this strategy involve: the origination of adjustable rate loans; increasing commercial loans, consumer loans that are adjustable rate and other short-term loans as a portion of total net loans receivable because of their generally shorter terms and higher yields than real estate one-to-four family loans; matching asset and liability maturities; and investing in short-term securities. The strategy for liabilities has been to shorten the maturities for both deposits and borrowings. \n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe longer-term objective is to increase the proportion of non-interest-bearing demand deposits, low interest- bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, and savings deposits relative to certificates of deposit to reduce our overall cost of funds.\nConsumer loans, such as home equity lines of credit and installment loans, commercial loans and construction loans typically have shorter terms and higher yields than real estate one-to-four family loans, and accordingly reduce the Company\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Adjustable interest rate loans totaled $403.6 million or 40.00% of total loans at March 31, 2023 as compared to $438.1 million or 44.23% at March 31, 2022. Although the Company has sought to originate adjustable rate loans, the ability to originate and purchase such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers\u2019 preferences. Particularly in lower interest rate environments, borrowers often prefer to obtain fixed-rate loans. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Lending Activities \u2013 Real Estate Construction \u201c and \u201c- Lending Activities - Consumer Lending.\u201d\nThe Company may also invest in short-term to medium-term U.S. Government securities as well as mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies. At March 31, 2023, the combined investment portfolio carried at $455.3 million had an average life of 6.1 years. Adjustable rate mortgage-backed securities totaled $3.7 million at March 31, 2023 compared to $5.5 million at March 31, 2022. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness \u2013 Investment Activities\u201d for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is essential to our business. The objective of the Bank\u2019s liquidity management is to maintain ample cash flows to meet obligations for depositor withdrawals, to fund the borrowing needs of loan customers, and to fund ongoing operations. Core relationship deposits are the primary source of the Bank\u2019s liquidity. As such, the Bank focuses on deposit relationships with local consumer and business clients who maintain multiple accounts and services at the Bank.\nLiquidity management is both a short and long-term responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. The Company adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management\u2019s assessment of (i) expected loan demand, (ii) projected loan sales, (iii) expected deposit flows, (iv) yields available on interest-bearing deposits and (v) its asset/liability management program objectives. Excess liquidity is invested generally in interest-bearing overnight deposits and other short-term government and agency obligations. If the Company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally, it has additional diversified and reliable sources of funds with the FHLB, the FRB and other wholesale facilities. These sources of funds may be used on a long or short-term basis to compensate for a reduction in other sources of funds or on a long-term basis to support lending activities.\nThe Company\u2019s primary sources of funds are customer deposits, proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans, proceeds from the sale of loans, maturing securities, FHLB advances and FRB borrowings. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and prepayment of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Management believes that its focus on core relationship deposits coupled with access to borrowing through reliable counterparties provides reasonable and prudent assurance that ample liquidity is available. However, depositor or counterparty behavior could change in response to competition, economic or market situations or other unforeseen circumstances, which could have liquidity implications that may require different strategic or operational actions.\nThe Company must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds for loan originations, deposit withdrawals and continuing operations, satisfy other financial commitments and take advantage of investment opportunities. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, the Bank used its sources of funds primarily to fund loan commitments and investment purchases. At March 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit held for investment and available for sale investment securities totaled $233.8 million, or 14.7% of total assets. Management believes that the Company\u2019s security portfolio is of high quality and its securities would therefore be marketable. The levels of these assets are dependent on the Company\u2019s operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. The Bank generally maintains sufficient cash and short-term investments to meet short-term liquidity needs; however, its primary liquidity management practice is to manage short-term borrowings, consistent with its asset/liability objectives. In addition to these primary sources of funds, the Bank has several secondary borrowing sources available to meet potential funding requirements, including FRB borrowings and FHLB advances. At March 31, 2023, the Bank had no advances from the FRB and maintains a credit facility with the FRB with available borrowing capacity of $57.4 million, subject to sufficient collateral. At March 31, 2023, FHLB advances totaled $123.8 million and the Bank had an available borrowing capacity of $315.4 million, subject to sufficient collateral and stock investment. At March 31, 2023, the Bank had sufficient unpledged collateral to allow it to utilize its available borrowing capacity from the FRB and the FHLB. Borrowing capacity may, however, fluctuate based on acceptability and risk rating of loan collateral and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at their discretion. \n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) was created by the Federal Reserve to support and make additional funding available to eligible depository institutions to help banks meet the needs of their depositors. Riverview has registered and is eligible to utilize the BTFP. Riverview does not intend to utilize the BTFP, but could do so should the need arise. \nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, deposits decreased $268.7 million. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, deposits increased $187.8 million. An additional source of wholesale funding includes brokered certificates of deposit. While the Company has utilized brokered deposits from time to time, the Company historically has not extensively relied on brokered deposits to fund its operations. At March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Bank had no wholesale brokered deposits. The Bank also participates in the CDARS and ICS deposit products, which allow the Company to accept deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit for a depositor and obtain \u201cpass-through\u201d insurance for the total deposit. The Bank\u2019s CDARS and ICS balances were $22.8 million, or 1.8% of total deposits, and $66.3 million, or 4.3% of total deposits, at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The combination of all the Bank\u2019s funding sources gives the Bank available liquidity of $702.5 million, or 44.2% of total assets at March 31, 2023.\nAt March 31, 2023, the Company had total commitments of $144.4 million, which includes commitments to extend credit of $12.5 million, unused lines of credit totaling $93.7 million, undisbursed construction loans totaling $36.6 million, and standby letters of credit totaling $1.6 million. For additional information regarding future financial commitments, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from March 31, 2023 totaled $84.6 million. Historically, the Bank has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature. Offsetting these cash outflows are scheduled loan maturities of less than one year totaling $37.0 million at March 31, 2023.\nThe Company incurs capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to expand and improve our product offerings, enhance and modernize our technology infrastructure, and to introduce new technology-based products to compete effectively in our markets. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on revenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and our expected return on investment. The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, current and projected demand for our services and products, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations. Based on our current capital allocation objectives, during fiscal 2024 we expect cash expenditures of approximately $3.7 million for capital investment in premises and equipment.\nRiverview, as a separate legal entity from the Bank, must provide for its own liquidity. Sources of capital and liquidity for Riverview include distributions from the Bank and the issuance of debt or equity securities. Dividends and other capital distributions from the Bank are subject to regulatory notice. Management currently expects to continue the Company\u2019s current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends on its common stock subject to the Board of Directors\u2019 discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. The current quarterly common stock dividend rate is $0.06 per share, as approved by the Board of Directors, which management believes is a dividend rate per share which enables the Company to balance our multiple objectives of managing and investing in the Bank, \u00a0and returning a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s cash to its shareholders. Assuming continued payment during fiscal year 2024 at this rate of $0.06 per share, average total dividends paid each quarter would be approximately $1.3 million based on the number of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares at March 31, 2023.

    "item7a": ">Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur financial condition and operations are influenced significantly by general economic conditions, including the absolute level of interest rates as well as changes in interest rates and the slope of the yield curve. Our profitability is dependent to a large extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest received from our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities.\u00a0Our activities, like all financial institutions, inherently involve the assumption of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will have an adverse impact on the institution\u2019s earnings and underlying economic value. Interest rate risk is determined by the maturity and repricing characteristics of an institution\u2019s assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet contracts. Interest rate risk is measured by the variability of financial performance and economic value resulting from changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk affecting our financial performance.\nOur Asset/Liability Management Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d) is responsible for monitoring and reviewing asset/liability processes and interest rate risk exposure to determine the level of risk appropriate given our operating environment, business plan strategies, performance objectives, capital and liquidity constraints, and asset and liability allocation alternatives; and to manage our interest rate risk consistent with regulatory guidelines and policies approved by the Board of Directors. Through such management, we seek to reduce the vulnerability of our earnings and capital position to changes in the level of interest rates. Our actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the ALCO, which is comprised of members of our senior management. The ALCO closely monitors our interest sensitivity exposure, asset and liability allocation decisions, liquidity and capital positions, and local and national economic conditions and attempts to structure the loan and investment portfolios and funding sources to maximize earnings within acceptable risk tolerances.\nThe Company does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument nor does it engage in hedging activities or purchase high-risk derivative instruments. Furthermore, the Company is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk. For information regarding the sensitivity to interest rate risk of the Company\u2019s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, see the tables under Item 1. \u201cBusiness \u2013 Lending Activities,\u201d \u201c\u2013 Investment Activities\u201d and \u201c\u2013 Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds\u201d.\nThe Company\u2019s principal financial objective is to achieve long-term profitability while limiting its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates. The Company intends to reduce risk where appropriate but accepts a degree of risk when warranted by economic circumstances. The Company has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities and interest rates. The principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the Company\u2019s interest-earning assets by retaining in its loan portfolio, short\u2013term loans and loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustments.\nConsumer and commercial loans are originated and held in the loan portfolio as the short-term nature of these portfolio loans match durations more closely with the short-term nature of retail deposits such as interest checking, money market accounts and savings accounts. The Company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds. Management believes retail deposits reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds. As part of its interest rate risk management strategy, the Company promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with longer terms to maturity. Except for immediate short-term cash needs, and depending on the current interest rate environment, FHLB advances will have short or long-term maturities. FRB borrowings have short-term maturities. For additional information, see Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d contained herein.\nA number of measures are utilized to monitor and manage interest rate risk, including simulation modeling and traditional interest rate gap analysis. While both methods provide an indication of risk for a given change in interest rates, the simulation model is primarily used to assess the impact on earnings that changes in interest rates may produce. Key assumptions in the model include cash flows and maturities of financial instruments, changes in market conditions, loan volumes and pricing, deposit sensitivity, consumer preferences and management\u2019s capital leverage plans. These assumptions are inherently uncertain; therefore, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may significantly differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and specific strategies among other factors.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the approximate percentage change in net interest income as of March 31, 2023 over a 12 and 24-month period under several instantaneous changes in interest rate scenarios:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nPercent\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0net\n\u200b\nPercent\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0net\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\ninterest\u00a0income\u00a0(12\n\u200b\ninterest\u00a0income\u00a0(24\n\u00a0\nChange in interest rates\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nmonths)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nmonths)\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nUp 300 basis points\n\u00a0\n (13.0)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n (3.2)\n%\nUp 200 basis points\n\u00a0\n (9.1)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n (0.9)\n%\nUp 100 basis points\n\u00a0\n (4.2)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 4.0\n%\nBase case\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u00a0\n 7.2\n%\nDown 100 basis points\n\u200b\n 0.4\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 5.7\n%\nDown 200 basis points\n\u200b\n (0.1)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 2.3\n%\nDown 300 basis points\n\u00a0\n (1.6)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n (2.8)\n%\n\u200b\nIn general, interest-earning assets reprice faster than interest-bearing liabilities in a given period. However, due to a number of loans in our loan portfolio with fixed interest rates, our net interest income will be negatively impacted in a rising interest rate environment. In a rising interest rate environment, net interest income will decrease in year one as set forth in the table above as our interest-bearing liabilities are expected to continue to increase faster than interest-earning assets. In a falling interest rate environment, our net interest income will be positively impacted in the first 100 basis point movement as our interest-bearing liabilities decrease faster in relation to our interest-earning assets. We attempt to limit our interest rate risk through managing the repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities.\nAs with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as ARM loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Furthermore, in the event of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b",
