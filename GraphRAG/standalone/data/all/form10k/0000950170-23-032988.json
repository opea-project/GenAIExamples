We offer a comprehensive portfolio of HCM technology and HR advisory solutions that help our clients navigate the evolving challenges of HR.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPaychex was incorporated in Delaware in 1979 and has a fiscal year that ends May 31st. We maintain our corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York, and serve clients throughout the U.S. and parts of Europe. As of May 31, 2023, we served approximately 740,000 payroll and PEO clients.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor any organization, a key function is effective HCM, which requires both resources and expertise. Organizations are faced with complex and ever-changing requirements, including diverse and complicated federal, state, and local regulations across multiple jurisdictions. In addition, the workplace is rapidly changing as employees increasingly become mobile, work remotely, and expect a user experience similar to consumer-oriented applications. We specialize in helping small- to medium-sized businesses who do not have the resources or expertise to adapt to the constantly evolving environment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPaychex offers a wide range of solutions \u2013 including HR outsourcing, HCM technology, payroll processing, retirement and insurance solutions \u2013 allowing us to customize our offering to the client's business, whether it is small or large, simple or complex. We believe that we have the breadth of solutions to cover the spectrum of the employee life cycle, but we also allow integration with some of the most popular HR, accounting, point-of-sale, and productivity applications on the market today.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur comprehensive solutions allow our clients to manage their workforces effectively from hire to retire. We provide leading-edge HCM technology, coupled with human expertise, to make complex HR, payroll, and benefits issues simple for our clients.

Over 50% of our revenues are gained from our services beyond payroll processing.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCompany Strategy\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur strategy is to be the leading provider of HCM solutions for HR, payroll, benefits, and insurance by being an essential partner to small- and medium-sized businesses. We believe that successfully executing this strategy will lead to strong, long-term financial performance. We intend to strengthen and extend our position as a leading provider through continued investments in both our innovative technology and HR advisory solutions. Key elements of our strategy include:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nProviding industry-leading, integrated technology\n. \nWe continue to invest significantly in our proprietary, award-winning Paychex Flex\n\u00ae\n platform and mobility applications to maximize efficiency and functionality for our clients and their employees. \n\n\n\u2022\nDelivering superior client experiences.\n \nOur flexible and technology-enabled service model allows us to provide a personalized experience for our clients and their employees. We continue to invest in artificial intelligence (\"AI\") and self-service capabilities to allow clients and their employees easy, intuitive, and flexible service how, when, and where they want it. \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nExpanding our leadership in HR.\n We have a comprehensive suite of value-added HR solutions for our clients and their employees. Our solutions include industry leading HR technology with comprehensive HR outsourcing delivered by approximately 700 HR business professionals. Our unique combination of industry leading HR technology and HR advisory solutions sets us apart in the industry. \n\n\n\u2022\nGrowing our client base.\n We believe we operate in a significantly under-penetrated and growing market, with untapped potential to expand within our current target markets. We have made substantial investments in new demand generation and sales tools and expanding certain areas of our sales force. We continue to focus on sales productivity with the intent of increasing our market share across all our solutions.\n\n\n\u2022\nEngaging in strategic acquisitions\n.\n We utilize acquisitions, when appropriate, as a means to expand our portfolio, enter new markets or increase our scale. We will continue to evaluate and monitor potential acquisitions and target acquisitions that are in alignment with our overall strategy.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur Solutions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur solutions bring together payroll and HCM software with HR and compliance expertise, along with flexible, personalized, and technology-enabled support capabilities. Clients have the option of doing payroll online using our SaaS technology, outsourcing to our payroll specialists, or using a combination of these methods. Payroll is integrated with HCM software modules for clients who have more complex HR needs. We also provide comprehensive HR outsourcing through our administrative services organization (\u201cASO\u201d) and PEO solutions. The integration of leading-edge technology and flexible support options allows us to meet our clients\u2019 needs how, when, and where they want.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe closely monitor the evolving challenges and needs of small- and medium-sized businesses, and proactively aid our clients in navigating macroeconomic challenges, legislative changes, and other complexities they face. In the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 (\u201cfiscal 2023\u201d), top challenges for employers were macroeconomic pressures including inflation and interest rates, maintaining sufficient staffing levels, providing appropriate employee development, keeping technology current, and ensuring legal and regulatory compliance.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe provide a unique blend of innovative technology solutions, backed by our extensive compliance and HR expertise, that help customers more effectively hire, engage, train, and retain top talent in this challenging workforce environment. As businesses operate in a tight labor market, having an online portal for employee self-service that is intuitive and easy-to-use helps increase employee retention and efficiency for our customers. We continue to invest in our technology, enhancing our solutions to continuously improve the customer and employee experiences from hiring and onboarding through employee retention.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHCM Technology:\n \nPaychex Flex is our proprietary HCM SaaS platform that provides seamless workforce management throughout the employee life cycle from recruiting and hiring to retirement through an integrated suite of solutions including recruiting, onboarding, HR, time and attendance and employee benefits. It utilizes a single cloud-based platform, with single client and employee records. Clients can select the modules they need and easily customize solutions as they grow. In addition, Paychex Flex presents function-focused analytics throughout the platform, providing HR leaders with data to make more informed business decisions. Paychex Flex uses a device-independent design throughout the HCM suite, which allows full functionality of all application components, regardless of device or screen size. We believe our Paychex mobile solutions add greater value and convenience for our clients and their employees by allowing them instant access on their mobile device, and we have experienced strong growth in mobile and self-service usage over the past year.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHR and Compliance Expertise:\n Paychex supports its HCM software solutions with 50+ years of experience. We have approximately 700 HR business professionals who are dedicated to our clients and have the experience and training to provide HR best practices and advice. Our HR business partners are available to provide our ASO and PEO clients with specific guidance on HR issues. In addition, we have over 250 compliance professionals who are in real-time contact with tax agencies and regulators to understand upcoming or newly enacted laws and regulations and advocate for our clients\u2019 interests. The contributions of these compliance experts are intended to ensure that our HCM solutions are updated timely to adhere to regulations and to help our clients stay in compliance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTechnology-Enabled Client Service:\n Paychex Flex also provides technology-enabled service with options that include self-service, a 24/7 dedicated service center, an individual payroll specialist, and integrated service via a multi-product service center. In addition, medium-sized clients can utilize a relationship manager for more personalized service. This flexible platform services our small- to medium-sized clients and a portion of our PEO business.\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWithin Paychex Flex, we leverage embedded AI to assist our clients. Our Paychex Flex Intelligence Engine allows individual preference on learning style - via written how-to-documents, tutorial-style video vignettes, or a guided interactive tour. The Paychex Flex Intelligence Engine also includes the Flex Assistant, a customer service chatbot that can answer questions across thousands of topics and provides access to over 1,200 instructional resources. At any time, a live Paychex agent is just a click away, with the entire chat conversation available in real-time to provide a more personalized service experience. The Flex Assistant consistently handles nearly two-thirds of questions that would otherwise reach a payroll/HR functionary or a customer service representative, with high satisfaction scores.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe platform embeds self-service capabilities that empower client employees to manage their HR and benefits information from any location, on any device. These self-service capabilities allow for greater access and convenience for client employees and greater productivity for clients.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur Clients\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPaychex has HR solutions to fit the needs of any small- to medium-sized business, from do-it-yourself payroll to comprehensive HR outsourcing. The target market for our integrated HCM solutions is small- to medium-sized businesses. Within this space, we serve a diverse client base operating in a broad range of industries throughout the U.S. and parts of Europe. The flexibility and scalability of our solutions allow our clients to select the best solution that meets their needs. We utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that generally do not contain specified contract periods and may be terminated by either party with 30-days notice of termination. We believe client retention is a useful indicator of client satisfaction with our solutions and support. For fiscal 2023, client retention was in the range of 82% to 83% of our beginning client base.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe support our small-business clients, reducing the complexity and risk of running their own payroll, while ensuring greater accuracy with up-to-date tax rates and regulatory information. We simplify their payroll with a combination of our solutions and customer support options for a quick and easy payday. Clients may choose to have our service team handle everything for them, or process payroll themselves utilizing our proprietary, robust SaaS Paychex Flex platform and our SurePayroll\n\u00ae\n SaaS-based solutions. Both solutions allow users to process payroll when they want, how they want, and on any device (desktop, tablet, and mobile phone).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile Paychex Flex is our primary SaaS-based platform utilized by the majority of our clients for their HCM needs, there are some clients that use other platforms, including SurePayroll clients, and certain PEO clients.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBoth our small- and medium-sized clients can choose one of our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, which include ASO and PEO solutions, and participate in our benefits offerings, which include our insurance and retirement services. Our insurance services simplify the insurance process to make it easy to find plans with the features and affordability to meet the client\u2019s needs. Our retirement services solutions offer many plan design options to meet the client\u2019s requirements, as well as investment options.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDescription of Solutions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWithin our HCM solutions we offer a comprehensive portfolio of HCM technology and HR advisory solutions that allow our clients to meet their diverse HR and payroll needs. Clients can select solutions on an \u00e1 la carte basis or as part of various solution bundles. Our offerings often leverage the information gathered in our base payroll processing service, allowing us to provide comprehensive outsourcing services covering the HCM spectrum.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur portfolio of solutions is comprised of the following:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement Solutions:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nPayroll processing solutions:\n Our payroll processing solutions include the calculation, preparation, and delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal accounting records and management reports; preparation of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection and remittance of clients\u2019 payroll obligations.\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nPayroll tax administration solutions:\n Payroll tax administration solutions provide for accurate preparation and timely filing of quarterly and year-end tax returns, as well as the electronic transfer of funds to the applicable federal, state, and local tax or regulatory agencies. In connection with these services, we electronically collect payroll taxes from clients\u2019 bank accounts, typically on payday, prepare and file the applicable tax returns, and remit taxes to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and 30 days after receipt of collections from clients, with some items extending up to 90 days. We handle regulatory correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest disputes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nEmployee payment solutions:\n Our employee payment solutions provide an employer the option of paying their employees by direct deposit, payroll debit card, a check drawn on a Paychex account (Readychex\n\u00ae\n), or a check drawn on the employer\u2019s account and electronically signed by us. For each of the first three methods, we electronically collect net payroll from the clients\u2019 bank accounts, typically one business day before payday, and provide payment to the employees on payday. Our Readychex solution provides a cost-effective solution that offers the benefit of convenient, one-step payroll account reconciliation for employers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe also allow employers to opt for more flexible pay options. Same day ACH functionality is also available for clients using direct deposit, allowing employers the flexibility to pay employees via direct deposit on the same day they initiate payroll. In addition, we are giving business owners the ability to leverage real-time payments to process payroll and deliver net pay to their employees immediately for time worked. Pay-on-demand functionality enables an employee to request access to a portion of earned pay before the scheduled pay date, which is deposited into a traditional bank account or a third-party account.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nRegulatory compliance solutions:\n We offer new-hire reporting solutions, which enable clients to comply with federal and state requirements to report information on newly hired employees. This information aids the government in enforcing child support orders and minimizes fraudulent unemployment and workers\u2019 compensation insurance claims. Our garnishment processing solution provides deductions from employees\u2019 pay, forwards payments to third-party agencies, including those that require electronic payments, and tracks the obligations to fulfillment. These solutions enable employers to comply with legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties. We also offer comprehensive solutions to help employers and employees with certain mandates under the Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d), which sets forth specific coverage and reporting requirements that employers must meet. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nHR solutions:\n Our ASO offers businesses a combined package that includes payroll, employer compliance, HR and employee benefits administration, risk management outsourcing, and both virtual and on-site availability of a professionally trained HR representative, among other services. Paychex HR Essentials is a lower touch solution that provides support to our clients over the phone or online to help manage employee-related topics. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nRetirement solutions administration: \nOur retirement solutions line offers a variety of options to employers, including 401(k) plans, 401(k) SIMPLE plans, SIMPLE IRAs, 401(k) plans with safe harbor provisions, owner-only 401(k) plans, Pooled Employer Plans, profit sharing plans, and money purchase plans. These solutions provide plan implementation, ongoing compliance with government regulations, employee and employer reporting, participant and employer online access, electronic funds transfer, and other administrative services. Auto enrollment is an optional plan feature that allows employers to automatically enroll employees in their company\u2019s 401(k) plan and increase overall plan participation. Clients may choose from a group of pre-defined fund selections or customize their investment options within their plan. We are the largest 401(k) recordkeeper for small businesses in the U.S. Our large-market retirement services include relationships with financial advisors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nHR administration solutions:\n We offer cloud-based HR administration software solutions for employee benefits management and administration, time and attendance reporting, recruiting, and onboarding. These services include: \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nPaychex HR Online offers powerful tools for managing employee personnel information, performance management, HR compliance and reporting. Our Learning Management solution complements our performance management tool. When combined with our workflow and approval engine, we offer businesses the flexibility to capture ongoing performance feedback, recommend and enroll employees in specific training courses, and leverage automated workflows to track progress and approve compensation changes tied to performance.\n\n\n\u2022\nDigital communication solutions, including Paychex Flex HR Connect and HR Conversations, which helps strengthen connections and keep workers engaged no matter their work location. Paychex Flex HR Connect \n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nprovides the ability to digitally submit questions, requests, and incident reports directly to HR through an easy-to-use workflow.

The InVision\nTM\n IRIS Time Clock, a biometric clock that scans the iris, provides fast and accurate time capture. Paychex Flex Time also works with wearable technology to allow for employees to clock in and out using their smartwatch.\n\n\n\u2022\nApplicant tracking suite provides technology solutions that streamline, simplify, and drive the applicant workflow and onboarding process for companies of all sizes. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nOther HR solutions and support:\n We offer the outsourcing of plan administration under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code, allowing employees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for certain health insurance benefits and health and dependent care expenses not covered by insurance. All required implementation, administration, compliance, claims processing and reimbursement, and coverage tests are provided with these services. We offer state unemployment insurance solutions, which provide clients with prompt processing for all claims, appeals, determinations, change statements, and requests for separation documents. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nBusiness services:\n We offer various business solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Paychex Advance, LLC, provides a portfolio of solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding (via the purchase of accounts receivable) and outsourcing services, which include payroll processing, invoicing, and tax preparation. Employee Retention Tax Credit Service, which proactively helps businesses retroactively identify tax credits available under the COVID-19 Cares Act, based on wages already paid, and file amended returns to claim the credit. In addition, through partnerships with third-party providers, we provide clients opportunities for solutions such as payment processing services, financial programs, and a small-business loan resource center.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPEO and Insurance Solutions:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nPEO solutions:\n Our licensed PEO subsidiaries offer businesses a combined package that includes payroll, employer compliance, HR and employee benefits administration, risk management outsourcing, and both virtual and on-site availability of a professionally trained HR representative, among other services. What differentiates our PEO solutions from our ASO solutions is that we serve as a co-employer of our clients\u2019 employees and assume the risks and rewards of certain workers\u2019 compensation insurance and certain health insurance offerings. We are certified under the Small Business Efficiency Act to provide PEO solutions. We offer the PEO Protection Plus Package, which helps business owners protect their bottom line from unforeseen costs, including cyberattacks and employee lawsuits, as exposure to these risks rapidly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic concerns.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nInsurance solutions: \nOur licensed insurance agency, Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc., provides insurance through a variety of carriers, allowing employers to expand their employee benefit and corporate offerings at an affordable cost. Insurance offerings include property and casualty coverage such as workers\u2019 compensation, business-owner policies, cybersecurity protection, commercial auto, and health and benefits coverage, including health, dental, vision, and life. Our insurance solutions simplify the insurance process to make it easy to find plans with the features and affordability to meet the client\u2019s needs. With access to numerous top national and regional insurance carriers, our professional insurance agents have access to a wide selection of plans from which they can best match the insurance needs of small businesses. Additionally, clients have the option to integrate their insurance plans with Paychex payroll processing for easy, accurate plan administration.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSales and Marketing\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe market and sell our solutions and support primarily through our direct sales force based in the markets we serve. Our direct sales force includes sales representatives who have defined geographical territories and specialize within our portfolio of solutions. Our sales representatives are also supported by marketing, advertising, public relations, trade shows, and telemarketing programs. Our virtual sales force manages inbound sales leads for the under twenty employee space, sales in areas without a direct sales force presence, and sales of various ancillary solutions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we utilize other indirect sales channels such as our relationships with existing clients, certified public accountants (\u201cCPAs\u201d), and banks for new client referrals. More than 50% of our new small-market payroll clients (excluding business acquisitions) come from these referral sources. Our dedicated business development group drives sales through banking, national associations, and franchise channels. We also utilize digital marketing as a means to market our services.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have a long-standing partnership with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (\u201cAICPA\u201d) as the preferred payroll provider for its AICPA Business Solutions\nTM\n Program. Our current partnership agreement with the AICPA is in place through September 2025. We also partner with numerous state CPA society organizations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur website is available at www.paychex.com. It is a cost-efficient channel that serves as a source of leads and new sales, while complementing the efforts of our direct and virtual sales forces. The website allows us to market to existing and prospective clients that want to learn more about our solutions and support, and offers information about our core lines of business: human resources (www.paychex.com/human-resources), payroll (www.paychex.com/payroll), benefits (www.paychex.com/employee-benefits), and insurance (www.paychex.com/business-insurance).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPaychex also builds on its reputation as an expert in the HCM industry by providing education and assistance primarily to businesses and the CPA community. We provide free webinars, podcasts, white papers, and other information on our website to inform businesses on the impact of regulatory change as well as HR and business best practices.

Our internal database source indicates that in the U.S., there are approximately 8 million employer firms in our target markets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe market for HCM services is highly competitive and fragmented. We have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national, international, regional, local, and online service providers. In addition to traditional payroll processing and HR service providers, we compete with in-house payroll and HR systems and departments. Payroll and HR systems and software are sold by many vendors. Our solutions also compete with a variety of providers of HR services, such as retirement services companies, insurance companies, HR and benefits consulting firms, and national and regional PEOs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCompetition in the payroll processing and HR services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness, product quality and reputation, including ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of service and product offerings, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of these areas. We believe that our leading-edge technology and mobility applications, combined with personalized support provided by industry professionals and our technology-enabled solution capabilities, distinguishes us from our competitors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSoftware Maintenance and Development\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update our proprietary software to provide payroll and HR services to our clients. We are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and maintaining our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace. We continue to enhance our SaaS solutions and mobility applications to offer our users an integrated and unified experience. Continued enhancement of the client and client employee experience is important to our future success.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHuman Capital\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business is critical to our future success and growth. We strive to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive (\u201cDE&I\u201d) workplace; attract, retain, and develop talented employees; and keep them safe. In fiscal 2023, we were a signatory to the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge, the single largest business-led initiative to advance DE&I in the workplace. We also created a new DE&I leadership position to ensure that our efforts in building and sustaining a diverse culture of inclusion are realized.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor detailed information regarding our human capital activities, we encourage investors to visit our Corporate Responsibility website page at https://www.paychex.com/corporate/corporate-responsibility.

None of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPaychex Culture\n: Our core cultural values (\u201cPaychex Values\u201d) are designed to guide decision making aligned to the expectations of clients, stockholders, regulators, employees, and the multiple communities in which we operate and to reflect our continuing commitment to DE&I. The Paychex Values are:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrity\n\n\nAccountability\n\n\nInnovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartnership\n\n\nRespect\n\n\nService\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEach of these values guide our decision-making process and are critical to our ongoing success. All employees are required to verify their understanding and observance of these values during our annual \u201cRight Way\u201d training, review these values with management during periodic performance discussions, and are further encouraged to attend ongoing training during the year. Volunteer \u201cCulture Champions\u201d throughout the Company also help promote these values daily. We encourage employee feedback through our employee engagement surveys, as described below. This approach empowers our employees and allows us to make a positive impact in the communities we work and serve. As a result of our commitment to these principles, in 2023 we were recognized by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices, as one of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies. We have achieved this recognition 15 times, and consecutively since 2012. In addition, we were also recognized by Forbes as a Best Employer for Diversity for 2023.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTalent Acquisition and Development:\n We compete for talent along with our direct competitors and other companies in the geographic areas we serve. We invest significant resources to attract and retain top talent. Our Talent Acquisition Team, in conjunction with certain third-party partners, have developed comprehensive processes to identify and recruit accomplished professionals.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOnce hired, our world-class Training Department provides functional training for payroll and HCM specialists and sales associates and also offers personal training, professional development, and leadership-development programs. As a result of our efforts, we have been recognized as one of the top training organizations in the world with a 2023 Training APEX Award presented by Training magazine. Paychex ranked number five on the prestigious list for the second year. This is also the Company's 22\nnd\n consecutive appearance on the list that identifies organizations that excel at training and employee development.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nComprehensive Compensation and Benefits: \nWe are committed to providing a fair wage and a total rewards package that allows our employees to be their best in every area of their lives.\n \nWe regularly review employee salaries to ensure we are competitive in the industry and offer financial benefits such as a 401(k) plan, employee stock purchase plan, tuition assistance, scholarships for children of employees, and financial education. We are also committed to rewarding employees with comprehensive and competitive benefits and well-being package which includes medical, prescription, dental, and vision insurance, short- and long-term disability, employee assistance program, paid family leave, and a variety of well-being programs. For fiscal 2023, compensation-related expenses accounted for approximately 60% of our total expenses.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmployee Well-being Initiatives: \nIn addition to providing a comprehensive compensation and benefits package, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for our employees. Healthier employees are at lower risk of injury from workplace related exposures, perform work more safely with lower rates of absenteeism, experience better job performance, and can live their lives more fully outside of work. Our well-being program is a robust program focusing on the physical, emotional, community, career, and financial health of our employees.\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur award-winning well-being initiatives offer a wide variety of services, tools, and resources that can help employees achieve their health goals using a holistic approach. In addition, we sponsor onsite health screenings, Red Cross blood donation events, flu vaccination clinics, vaping and tobacco cessation, weight management, resiliency training, meditation and yoga classes, and a variety of other programs. Similar to our Culture Champions, we also promote the use of \u201cWell-Being Champions\u201d - Paychex employees who serve as a liaison between the Employee Well-Being Program and their team members. Our employees\u2019 financial well-being is equally important, so we have developed programs for financial education and support. We maintain procedures for events such as fires, severe weather, medical emergencies, and active shooters, as well as other important information related to general workforce safety.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn recognizing the ever-growing diversity of our workplace, we annually celebrate Paychex Culture Day. This is an additional paid day off for employees to celebrate and recognize a holiday that is significant to them. This is just one of the many ways we celebrate our unique heritages, and it reflects our Company's commitment to DE&I and flexibility.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmployee Engagement\n: We regularly ask our employees to share their views on working at Paychex through company-wide engagement surveys. Facilitated internally by our Human Resources Organizational Development Team, the survey methodology is periodically updated to reflect currents trends and issues including company direction and strategy, DE&I, individual development, collaboration, and our Paychex Values. A third-party administers the survey in order to maintain confidentiality of responses.\u202fWe use the survey responses to help inform management and assist in developing programs and policies that will maintain and promote Paychex Values.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIntellectual Property\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and software, and other intellectual property rights. Collectively, our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the \u201cPaychex\u201d name, trademark, and logo are of material importance to us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSeasonality\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is no significant seasonality to our business. However, during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the number of new payroll clients, new retirement services clients, and new worksite employees associated with our ASO and PEO businesses tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily because many businesses prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to year-end bonus payments, additional year-end services, and the preparation and delivery of end-of year reporting requirements.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAvailable Information\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are subject to the informational and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that includes our reports, proxy statements, and other information.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur corporate website, www.paychex.com, provides materials for investors and information about our services. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other SEC filings, as well as any amendments to such reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are made available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into our Form 10-K.

    "item1a": ">Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur future results of operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results, and from our projections. The following risk factors represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business. These are not the only risks we face. Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect, possibly to a material extent, our business, cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations in future periods. In addition, refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K.\n\n\n \n\n\nBusiness and Operational Risks\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our solutions and support.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe market for our solutions is characterized by rapid technological advancements, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and changing industry standards. To maintain our growth strategy, we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients. Our future success will depend on our ability to: enhance our current solutions and introduce new solutions in order to keep pace with solutions offered by our competitors, including the successful utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions; enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal systems, particularly our systems that meet our clients\u2019 requirements; and adapt to technological advancements and changing industry standards. We continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology. If our systems become outdated, it may negatively impact our ability to meet performance expectations related to quality, time to market, cost and innovation relative to our competitors. The failure to provide a more efficient and user-friendly customer-facing digital experience across internet and mobile platforms as well as in physical locations may adversely impact our business and operating results. There can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful. If we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner, or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results, there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations. The failure to continually develop enhancements and use of technologies such as robotics and other workflow automation tools, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence/machine learning may impact our ability to increase the efficiency of and reduce costs associated with operational risk management and compliance activities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may experience software defects, undetected errors, and development delays, which could damage our relationship with clients, decrease our potential profitability and expose us to liability.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur solutions rely on software and computing systems that can encounter development delays, and the underlying software may contain undetected errors, viruses or defects. Defects in our solutions and errors or delays caused by our solutions could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, loss of credibility with current or potential clients, harm to our reputation and exposure to liability. In addition, we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors, viruses or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe could be subject to reduced revenues, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position as a result of cyberattacks, security vulnerabilities or Internet disruptions.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe rely upon information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) networks, cloud-based platforms, and systems to process, transmit, and store\n \nelectronic information, and to support a variety of business processes, some of which are provided by third-party vendors. Cyberattacks and security threats are a\n \nrisk to our business and reputation. A cyberattack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption or outage, corruption of data, or theft\n \nof personal or other sensitive information, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or that of our clients, result in liability or regulatory\n \nsanction, or cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss in confidence in our ability to serve clients all of which could have a material adverse\n \neffect on our business. The rapid speed of disruptive innovations involving cyberattacks, security vulnerabilities and Internet disruptions enabled by new and\n \nemerging technologies may outpace our organization's ability to compete and/or manage the risk appropriately. In addition, cybercriminals may seek to engage in payment-related fraud or by more frequently attempting to gain access to our systems\n \nthrough phishing or other means. Furthermore, security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting IT products and businesses. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nData Security and Privacy Leaks\n: We collect, use, and retain increasingly large amounts of personal information about our clients, employees of our clients, and our employees, including: bank account, credit card, and social security numbers, tax return information, health care information, retirement account information, payroll information, system and network passwords, and other sensitive personal and business information. At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile cyber and ransomware attacks and data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. We may be particularly targeted for cyberattack because of the amount and type of personal and business information that we collect, use, and retain. Vulnerabilities, threats, and more sophisticated and targeted computer crimes pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Furthermore, if any of our solutions contains a software vulnerability, the vulnerability may be exploited to obtain access to our data or our clients\u2019 data.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur service platforms enable our clients to store and process personal data on premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment that we host. The security of our IT infrastructure is an important consideration in our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventative or responsive measures. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we are focused on ensuring that our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information. We may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our information security and controls, and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. While we have security systems and IT infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information, if our security measures are breached, either internally or externally, our business could be substantially harmed, and we could incur significant liabilities. Any such breach or unauthorized access could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us, result in reputational damage, and subject us to lawsuits, regulatory fines, or other actions or liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Third-parties, including vendors that provide services for our operations, could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nData Loss and Business Interruption:\n If our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason, including Internet or systems failure, or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons, both the Company and our clients could experience data loss, financial loss, harm to reputation, or significant business interruption. Hardware, applications, and services, including cloud-based services, that we develop or procure from third-party vendors may contain defects in design or other problems that could compromise the integrity and availability of our services. Any delays or failures caused by network outages, software or hardware failures, or other data processing disruptions, could result in our inability to provide services in a timely fashion or at all. The speed to closure of significant cybersecurity incidents may be influenced by the cooperation of governmental or law enforcement agencies. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future. Such events may expose us to unexpected liability, litigation, regulatory investigation and penalties, loss of clients\u2019 business, unfavorable impact to business reputation, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the event of a catastrophe, our business continuity plan may fail, which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster, unauthorized security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attack or act of war, public health emergency, pandemic, or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. Climate-related weather disasters, including hurricanes, flooding, snowstorms, and severe rainstorms, could also threaten the business continuity of our operations. We have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events. Our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather, including hurricanes, floods, snowstorms, and rainstorms and has been successful. However, these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future. If the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario, we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be adversely impacted by any failure of third-party service providers to perform their functions.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs part of providing services to clients, we rely on a number of third-party service providers. Service providers include, but are not limited to, couriers used to deliver client payroll checks, banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees, and information technology vendors servicing cloud-based platforms. Failure by these service providers, for any reason, to deliver their services in a timely manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in material interruptions to our operations, impact client relations, and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us.\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be exposed to additional risks related to our co-employment relationship within our PEO business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMany federal and state laws that apply to the employer-employee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the \u201cco-employment\u201d relationship within our PEO business. State and federal positions regarding co-employment relationships are in a constant state of flux and change with varying degrees of impact on our operations. We cannot predict when changes will occur or forecast whether any future changes will be favorable or unfavorable to our operations. There is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees, who may be deemed to be our agents, even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations. Although our agreements with clients provide that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or their employees\u2019 conduct, we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations. In addition, we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the \u201cemployer\u201d under any applicable state or federal laws. Incurring additional liabilities related to our PEO business may adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation rates and underlying claims trends.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWithin our PEO business, we maintain health and workers\u2019 compensation insurance covering worksite employees. The insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our PEO costs. If we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claims activity, our costs could increase. In addition, in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts, we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms, if at all. Also, as a co-employer in the PEO, we assume or share many of the employer-related responsibilities associated with health care reform, which may result in increased costs. Increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe made and may continue to make acquisitions that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAcquisitions subject us to risks, including increased debt, assumption of unforeseen liabilities, and difficulties in integrating operations. Successful integration involves many challenges, including the difficulty of developing and marketing new solutions and support, our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, and the loss of key employees of an acquired business. The integration and conversion of our acquired operations or other future acquisitions, if any, could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating these businesses as one are not achieved, a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process, and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process. In addition, an acquisition could adversely impact cash flows and/or operating results, and dilute stockholder interests, for many reasons, including charges to our income to reflect the impairment of acquired intangible assets including goodwill, interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition, and any issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or new business venture that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current stockholders. If the integration of any or all of our acquisitions or future acquisitions is not successful, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinancial Risks\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur clients could have insufficient funds to cover payments we made on their behalf, resulting in financial loss to us.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs part of our payroll processing service, we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from their accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing authorities. It is possible that we could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them. We have in the past, and may in the future, make payments on our clients\u2019 behalf for which we may not be reimbursed, resulting in loss to us. If a significant number of our clients are unable to cover payments we make on their behalf, our results of operations will be materially adversely impacted.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees.\n \nA change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies could\n \nadversely impact interest income.\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCertain of our debt agreements contain covenants that may constrain the operation of our business, and our failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) that we entered into in January 2019\n \nin connection with our acquisition of Oasis Outsourcing Group Holdings, L.P., contains covenants which may restrict our flexibility to operate our business. These covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, substantial changes in the general nature of our business and our subsidiaries (taken as a whole), certain merger\n \ntransactions, certain sales of assets and other matters, all subject to certain exceptions. The Agreement also contains financial covenants, which are reviewed for\n \ncompliance on a quarterly basis, that require us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 3.5:1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.0:1.0. In\n \naddition, certain of our indebtedness may not exceed 20% of our consolidated stockholders\u2019 equity. If we do not comply with these covenants, it could result in\n \nmaterial adverse effects on our operating results and our financial condition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLegal, Regulatory and Political Risks\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business, services, and financial condition may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMany of our services, particularly payroll tax administration services, employee benefit plan administration services, and PEO services are designed according to government regulations that often change. Changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required, or may choose, to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay. Such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue. The addition of complex added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business and reputation may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur services are subject to various laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the SECURE Act 2.0, data privacy regulations, and anti-money laundering rules. The growth of our international operations also subjects us to additional risks, such as compliance with foreign laws and regulations. The enactment of new laws and regulations, modifications of existing laws and regulations, or the adverse application or interpretation of new or existing laws or regulations can adversely affect our business. Failure to update our services to comply with modified or new legislation in the areas of payment networks, health care reform and retirement plans as well as failure to educate and assist our clients regarding this legislation could adversely impact our business reputation and negatively impact our client base. Failure to comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, which require us to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, and maintain transaction records, could result in civil and criminal penalties and adversely impact our business reputation.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are required to comply with regulations administered by multi-national bodies and governmental agencies worldwide including, but not limited to, the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d). OFAC places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons. A violation of a sanction or embargo program, or of the FCPA, or similar laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials, could subject us, and individual employees, to a regulatory enforcement action as well as significant civil and criminal penalties which could adversely impact our business and operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur reputation, results of operations, or financial condition may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with data privacy laws and regulations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur solutions require the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees, including personal or identifying information, as well as geolocation and biometric data. Certain solutions are enhanced with the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Our solutions are subject to various complex government laws and regulations on the federal, state, and local levels, including those governing personal privacy, as well as ethical considerations. In the U.S., we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, the ACA, federal and state labor and employment laws, and state data breach notification and data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended. Our European operations are subject to the European Union\u2019s General Data Privacy Regulation. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We could be subject to litigation or reputational risk if we or our third-party providers fail to utilize data practices sufficient to safeguard proprietary, confidential, and personal or identifying information. The regulatory\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nframework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, we may be\n \nunable to do so effectively in all cases. Our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other wrongful conduct by employees\n \nor third-parties. To the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks, copyrights, patents, or other means, other parties with\n \nknowledge of our intellectual property, including former employees, may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own and others\u2019 advantage. Competitors\n \nmay also misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and solutions. Any significant impairment or\n \nmisappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand and may adversely affect our ability to compete.\n \nThird parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. To the extent we seek to enforce or must defend our intellectual property rights\n \nwith litigation, we could incur significant expenses and/or be required to pay substantial damages. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or\n \nvendors in connection with claims or litigation. The litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could be costly and time-consuming.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are involved in litigation from time to time arising from the operation of our business and, as such, we could incur substantial judgments, fines, legal fees, or other costs.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees, or other third-parties for various actions. From time to\n \ntime, we are involved in litigation involving claims related to, among other things, breach of contract, tortious conduct, and employment and labor law matters. The\n \ndamages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings could be substantial. Although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims, if one\n \nor more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim, this could have a material adverse\n \neffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition may be impacted by macroeconomic and/or political factors of the U.S. and global economy and such impact could be materially adverse.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe and our clients are subject to the impacts related to inflationary pressure, the recent instability of the banking environment, and other macroeconomic and/or political events. Banking volatility may subject us and our clients to losses on uninsured funds and may make equity or debt financing more difficult to obtain, and additional equity or debt financing might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. Additionally, our business is substantially dependent on our clients\u2019 continued use of our solutions and support, and our results of operations will decline if our clients are no longer willing or able to use them. Our clients are sensitive to negative changes in economic conditions. If they cease operations or file for bankruptcy protection, we may not be paid for services we already provided, and our client base will shrink, which will lower our revenue. If under financial pressure, our clients may determine that they are no longer willing to pay for the solutions and support we provide, which would reduce our revenue. Our clients may decrease their workforce, which would decrease their demand for our services. Because of spending constraints on our clients and competition in the industry, we may face pricing pressure on our services and challenges in onboarding new clients, which would reduce revenue and ultimately impact our results of operations. Furthermore, if the third-party service providers we rely on are unable to perform their services for us and our clients, our operations could be materially disrupted, and we could face significant penalties or liabilities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be adversely impacted by volatility in the political and economic environment.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTrade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and variability. Additionally, instability in the banking environment may adversely affect our business. These conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business. Further, rising inflation may negatively impact our business, raise costs and reduce profitability. Current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services. In addition, new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe invest our funds held for clients in high quality, investment-grade marketable available-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) securities, money markets, and other cash equivalents. We also invest our corporate funds in short- to intermediate-term instruments. Funds held for clients and corporate investments are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks. These risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility and inflationary pressure. The interest we earn on funds held for clients and corporate investments may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest or lower interest rates. In addition, during periods of volatility in the credit markets, certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in, further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds. If we are unable to reinvest our AFS securities when they mature, our interest income earned and investment portfolio would be reduced. If we sell AFS securities to satisfy short-term funding requirements, we may recognize losses, which would further reduce the interest income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConstriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings. Historically, we have periodically borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet short-term liquidity needs. However, should we require additional short-term liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds, a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us. Growth in services for funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry may be constricted if access to financing becomes limited. In addition, our ability to grow through significant acquisitions may be limited. See also \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d If all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified people, which could impact the quality of our services and customer satisfaction.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur success, growth, and financial results depend in part on our continuing ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified and diverse personnel at all levels, including management, technical, compliance, and sales personnel. Competition for these individuals can be intense, and we may not be able to retain our key people, or attract, assimilate, or retain other highly-qualified individuals in the future, which could harm our future success.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the event we receive negative publicity, our reputation and the value of our brand could be harmed, and clients may not use our solutions and support, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are committed to good corporate citizenship, which is reflected in our company culture and core values. Disclosure of our corporate governance practices including our ESG initiatives, may draw negative publicity from stakeholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNegative publicity relating to events or activities attributed to us, our policies, our corporate employees, or others associated with us, whether or not justified, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. If we are unable to maintain quality HCM and employee benefit-related solutions and PEO and insurance solutions, our reputation with our clients may be harmed and the value of our brand may diminish. In addition, if\n \nour brand is negatively impacted, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, including challenges retaining clients or attracting new clients and\n \nrecruiting talent and retaining employees.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n",
