(including its subsidiaries) (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company\u2019s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in \nInternal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013)\n, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, the Company\u2019s management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under the heading \u201cReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.\u201d \n/s/ Fabrizio Freda\n/s/ Tracey T. Travis\nFabrizio Freda\nTracey T. Travis\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAugust\u00a018, 2023\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity and redeemable noncontrolling interest and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023 appearing on page S-1 (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in\n Internal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013)\n \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in\n Internal Control - Integrated Framework \n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nF-3\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nInterim Goodwill Impairment Assessment - Dr.Jart+ Reporting Unit\nAs described in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s consolidated balance of goodwill was $2,486 million as of June 30, 2023, of which $304 million relates to the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit. Management assesses goodwill at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist. Management concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting unit, along with increases in the weighted average cost of capital, triggered the need for an interim impairment review of the Company\u2019s goodwill. Management completed an interim quantitative impairment test for goodwill as of November 30, 2022. The fair value of the reporting unit was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches. The significant assumptions used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, and comparable market multiples.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the interim goodwill impairment assessment - Dr.Jart+ reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates and weighted average cost of capital; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management\u2019s process for developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income and market approaches; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the approaches; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. Evaluating management\u2019s assumption related to revenue growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumption was reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the income approach and (ii) the reasonableness of the weighted average cost of capital significant assumption. \nAcquisition of 001 Del LLC - Valuation of TOM FORD Trademark Intangible Asset\nAs described in Notes 2, 5, and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, on April 28, 2023, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests in 001 Del LLC, the sole owner of the TOM FORD brand and its related intellectual property. The acquisition has been accounted for as an asset acquisition as the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in the value of the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset. The Company recognizes assets acquired in an asset acquisition based on the cost to the Company on a relative fair value basis. The fair value of the trademark was determined using an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value were revenue growth rates, terminal value, beauty royalty savings, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, and royalty rates. The total cost of the asset acquisition of $2,578 million was allocated to the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset from the acquisition of 001 Del LLC  is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the trademark intangible asset acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s significant assumptions related to terminal value, beauty royalty savings, and weighted average cost of capital; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nF-4\nTable of Contents\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition, including controls over the valuation of the trademark intangible asset. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management\u2019s process for developing the fair value estimate; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the relief-from-royalty method; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the method; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to terminal value, beauty royalty savings, and weighted average cost of capital. Evaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to terminal value and beauty royalty savings involved evaluating whether the assumptions were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the brand; (ii) the consistency with external market data and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.  Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the relief-from-royalty method and (ii) the reasonableness of the weighted average cost of capital significant assumption.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nAugust 18, 2023\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2020.\nF-5\nTable of Contents\nTHE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 - \nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. manufactures, markets and sells skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products around the world.\u00a0Products are marketed under owned brand names, including:\u00a0Est\u00e9e Lauder, Aramis, Clinique, Lab Series, Origins, M\u00b7A\u00b7C, La Mer, Bobbi Brown Cosmetics\n,\n Aveda, Jo Malone London, Bumble and bumble, Darphin Paris, TOM FORD, Smashbox, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle, GLAMGLOW, Kilian Paris, Too Faced, Dr.Jart+, and The Ordinary.\u00a0The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. is also the global licensee of the AERIN and BALMAIN brand names for fragrances and cosmetics.\nNOTE 2 \u2013 \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d).\u00a0All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nCertain amounts in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\nManagement Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.\u00a0Certain significant accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, business combinations and asset acquisitions, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, income taxes, redeemable noncontrolling interest and Deciem Beauty Group Inc. (\u201cDECIEM\u201d) stock options.\u00a0Management evaluates the related estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate.\u00a0As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.\u00a0Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nCurrency Translation and Transactions\nAll assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at year-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at monthly average rates of exchange for the period.\u00a0Unrealized translation gains (losses), net of tax, reported as translation adjustments through other comprehensive income (loss) (\u201cOCI\u201d) attributable to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. were $(\n85\n) million, $(\n427\n) million and $\n147\n million, net of tax, in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the Company\u2019s subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Remeasurement adjustments in financial statements in a highly inflationary economy and other transactional gains and losses are reflected in earnings.\u00a0These subsidiaries are not material to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements or liquidity in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures. The Company also uses cross-currency swap contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency changes on certain intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. Additionally, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations, which are designated as net investment hedges. \nSee \nNote 12 \u2013 Derivative Financial Instruments\n for further discussion\n.\n The Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.\nThe accompanying consolidated statements of earnings include net exchange gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions of $\n57\n million, $(\n11\n) million and $(\n12\n) million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include $\n66\n million and $\n1,883\n million of short-term time deposits at June\u00a030, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\u00a0The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nInvestments\nInvestments in the common stock of privately-held companies in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but less than a controlling financial interest, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For those equity securities without readily determinable fair values where the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence, the Company records them at cost, less impairment, plus/minus subsequent observable price changes, and performs an assessment each quarter to determine whether or not a triggering event has occurred that results in changes in fair value.\u00a0Collectively, these investments were not material to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements as of June\u00a030, 2023 and 2022 and are included in Other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable, net is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions.\u00a0Payment terms are short-term in nature and are generally less than one year.\nThe Company is required to measure credit losses based on the Company\u2019s estimate of expected losses rather than incurred losses, which generally results in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. The Company evaluates certain criteria, including aging and historical write-offs, the current economic condition of specific customers and future economic conditions of countries utilizing a consumption index to determine the appropriate allowance for credit losses. The Company writes-off receivables once it is determined that the receivables are no longer collectible and as allowed by local laws. See \nNote 14 \u2013 Revenue Recognition\n for additional information.\nInventory and Promotional Merchandise\nInventory and promotional merchandise only includes inventory considered saleable or usable in future periods, and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method.\u00a0Cost components include raw materials, componentry, direct labor and overhead (e.g., indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and warehousing) as well as inbound freight.\u00a0Manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity.\u00a0Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred.\u00a0Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the merchandise is shipped to the Company\u2019s customers.\u00a0Included in inventory and promotional merchandise is an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value. This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age and historical results.\u00a0In addition, and as necessary, specific reserves for future known or anticipated events may be established.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company\u2019s derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value.\u00a0All derivatives are (i)\u00a0designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (\u201cfair value\u201d hedge), (ii)\u00a0designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (\u201ccash flow\u201d hedge), or (iii)\u00a0not designated as a hedging instrument.\u00a0Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments).\u00a0Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction are recorded in OCI.\u00a0Gains and losses deferred in OCI are then recognized in current-period earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged forecasted transaction (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings).\u00a0Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in current-period earnings. All derivative gains and losses relating to cash flow hedges and fair value hedges are recognized in the same income statement line as the hedged items. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations, which are designated as net investment hedges. See \nNote 12 \u2013 Derivative Financial Instruments\n for further discussion.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, including leasehold and other improvements that extend an asset\u2019s useful life or productive capabilities, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.\u00a0Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage and expensed as incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages.\u00a0Capital costs incurred while an asset is being built are classified as Construction in progress and are reclassified to its respective asset class when placed into service. For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from \n3\n to \n40\n years.\u00a0Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.\nBusiness Combinations and Asset Acquisitions\nThe Company evaluates whether a transaction meets the definition of a business. The Company first applies a screen test to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the screen test is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the screen test is not met, the Company further considers whether the set of assets or acquired entities have at a minimum, inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs in the form of revenue. If the assets or acquired entities meet this criteria, the transaction is accounted for as a business combination. \nThe Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, the Company's consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. \nThe Company recognizes assets acquired in an asset acquisition based on the cost to the Company on a relative fair value basis, which includes transaction costs in addition to consideration transferred and liabilities assumed or issued as part of the transaction. Neither goodwill nor bargain purchase gains are recognized in an asset acquisition; any excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired, or the opposite, is allocated to qualifying assets based on their relative fair values. \nThe determination of fair value, as well as the expected useful lives of certain assets acquired, requires management to make judgments and may involve the use of significant estimates, including assumptions with respect to estimated future cash flows, discount rates and valuation multiples from comparable publicly traded companies, among other things. See \nNote 5 \u2013 Business and Asset Acquisitions\n for further information.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.\u00a0Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.\u00a0Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.\nThe Company assesses goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.\u00a0The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the Company\u2019s operating segments.\u00a0The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components.\u00a0The Company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for its reporting units. When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company uses a single quantitative step when determining the subsequent measurement of goodwill by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recording an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\u00a0When testing other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company also has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative test.\u00a0The quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.\u00a0If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.\nSee \nNote 6 \u2013 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n for further information.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, primarily intangible assets subject to amortization, right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\u00a0When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value.\u00a0If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be measured and recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. Specifically for right-of-use assets, estimated fair value is based on discounting market rent using a real estate discount rate.\nLeases\nThe Company recognizes a lease liability and a related right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) asset at the commencement date for leases on its consolidated balance sheet, excluding short-term leases as noted below. The lease liability is equal to the present value of unpaid lease payments over the remaining lease term. The Company\u2019s lease term at the commencement date may reflect\u00a0options to extend\u00a0or\u00a0terminate\u00a0the lease when it is reasonably certain that such options will be exercised. To determine the present value of the lease liability, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate, which is defined as the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow (on a collateralized basis over a similar term) an amount equal to the lease payments in similar economic environments. The ROU asset is based on the corresponding lease liability adjusted for certain costs such as initial direct costs, prepaid lease payments and lease incentives received. Both operating and finance lease ROU assets are reviewed for impairment, consistent with other long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. After an ROU asset is impaired, any remaining balance of the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life.\nAfter the lease commencement date, the Company evaluates lease modifications, if any, that could result in a change in the accounting for leases. For a lease modification, an evaluation is performed to determine if it should be treated as either a separate lease or a change in the accounting of an existing lease. In addition, significant changes in events or circumstances within the Company\u2019s control are assessed to determine whether a change in the accounting for leases is required.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor lease modifications that result in partial termination of the lease, the Company has elected the proportional method whereby the carrying amount of the ROU asset is decreased in proportion with the full or partial termination of the lease based on the adjustment to the carrying value of the lease liability. The difference between those adjustments is recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings at the effective date of the termination.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s leases provide for variable lease payments for the right to use an underlying asset that vary due to changes in facts and circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time. Variable lease payments that are dependent on an index or rate (e.g., Consumer Price Index) are included in the initial measurement of the lease liability, the initial measurement of the ROU asset, and the lease classification test based on the index or rate as of the commencement date. Any changes from the commencement date estimation of the index- and rate-based variable payments are expensed as incurred in the period of the change. Variable lease payments that are not known at the commencement date and are determinable based on the performance or use of the underlying asset\n,\n are not included in the initial measurement of the lease liability or the ROU asset, but instead are expensed as incurred. The Company\u2019s variable lease payments primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels, common area maintenance based on the percentage of the total square footage leased by the Company, as well as costs relating to embedded leases, such as third-party manufacturing agreements. \nCertain of the Company\u2019s contracts contain lease components as well as non-lease components, such as an agreement to purchase services. For purposes of allocating contract consideration, the Company does not separate the lease components from non-lease components for all asset classes. \nShort-term leases (i.e. leases with a term of 12 months or less) are not recorded as ROU assets or lease liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets, and the related lease payments are recognized in net earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nFor certain leases relating to automobiles, information technology equipment and office equipment, the Company utilizes the portfolio approach. Under this approach, the Company combines and accounts for leases (as a portfolio) with similar characteristics (e.g., lease term, discount rates, etc.) as a single lease, provided its application is not materially different when compared to the application at the individual lease level.\nSee \nNote \n7\n \u2013 Leases\n for further information.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and seller of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.\u00a0The Company\u2019s sales subject to credit risk are made primarily to retailers in its travel retail business, department stores, specialty multi-brand retailers and perfumeries. The Company grants credit to qualified customers. While the Company does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk at this time, it continues to monitor its customers' abilities, individually and collectively, to make timely payments.\nRevenue Recognition\nPerformance Obligations \nThe Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product and other promised goods and services to a customer. \nThe Company sells wholesale to customers in distribution channels that include department stores, travel retail, specialty-multi retailers, perfumeries, salons/spas and through various online sites operated by authorized retailers, including pure-play sites. The primary performance obligation related to these channels of distribution is product sales where revenue is recognized as control of the product transfers to the customer. In the Americas region, revenue is generally recognized at the time the product is made available and provided to the customer\u2019s carrier at the Company\u2019s location, and in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, revenue is generally recognized based upon the customer\u2019s receipt. \nF-15\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company also sells direct to consumers at Company-operated freestanding stores and online through Company-owned and operated e-commerce and m-commerce sites and through third-party online malls. At Company-operated freestanding stores, revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred at the point of sale. Revenue from online sales is recognized when control of the product is transferred, generally based upon the consumer\u2019s receipt. \nIn connection with the sale of product, the Company may provide other promised goods and services that are deemed to be performance obligations. These are comprised of gift with purchase and purchase with purchase promotions, customer loyalty program obligations, gift cards and other promotional goods including samples and testers. \nThe Company offers a number of different loyalty programs to its customers across regions, brands and distribution channels including points-based programs, tier-based programs and other programs. Revenue is allocated between the saleable product revenue and the material right loyalty obligations based on relative standalone selling prices when the consumer purchases the products that are earning them the right to the future benefits. Deferred revenue related to the Company\u2019s loyalty programs is estimated based on the standalone selling price and is adjusted for an estimated breakage factor. Standalone selling price is determined primarily using the observable market price of the good or service benefit if it is sold by the Company or a cost plus margin approach for goods/services not directly sold by the Company. Breakage rates consider historical patterns of redemption and/or expiration. Revenue is recognized when the benefits are redeemed or expire. \nThe Company provides gift with purchase promotional products to certain customers generally without additional charge and also provides purchase with purchase promotional products to certain customers at a discount in relation to prices charged for saleable product. Revenue is allocated between saleable product, gift with purchase product and purchase with purchase product based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices. Revenue is deferred and ultimately recognized based on the timing differences, if any, between when control of promotional goods and control of the related saleable products transfer to the Company\u2019s customer (e.g., a third-party retailer), which is calculated based on the weighted-average number of days between promotional periods. The estimated standalone selling price allocated to promotional goods is based on a cost plus margin approach. \nIn situations where promotional products are provided by the Company to its customers at the same time as the related saleable product, such as shipments of samples and testers, the cost of these promotional products are recognized as a cost of sales at the same time as the related revenue is recognized and no deferral of revenue is required.\n \nThe Company also offers gift cards through Company-operated freestanding stores and Company-owned websites. The related deferred revenue is estimated based on expected breakage that considers historical patterns of redemption taking into consideration escheatment laws as applicable. \nProduct Returns, Sales Incentives and Other Forms of Variable Consideration \nIn measuring revenue and determining the consideration the Company is entitled to as part of a contract with a customer, the Company takes into account the related elements of variable consideration. Such elements of variable consideration include product returns and sales incentives, such as volume rebates and discounts, markdowns, margin adjustments and early-payment discounts. We also enter into arrangements containing other forms of variable consideration, including certain demonstration arrangements, for which the Company does not receive a distinct good or service or for which the Company cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service. For these types of arrangements, the adjustments to revenue are recorded at the later of when (i) the Company recognizes revenue for the transfer of the related goods or services to the customer, or (ii) the Company pays, or promises to pay, the consideration. \nFor the sale of goods with a right of return, the Company only recognizes revenue for the consideration it expects to be entitled to (considering the products to be returned) and records a sales return accrual within Other accrued liabilities for the amount it expects to credit back its customers. In addition, the Company recognizes an asset included in Inventory and promotional merchandise and a corresponding adjustment to Cost of sales for the right to recover goods from customers associated with the estimated returns. \nF-16\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe sales return accrual and corresponding asset include estimates that directly impact reported net sales. These estimates are calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels. Consideration of these factors results in an estimate for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations. In addition, as necessary, sales return accruals and the related assets may be established for significant future known or anticipated events. The types of known or anticipated events that are considered, and will continue to be considered, include the financial condition of the Company\u2019s customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and the Company\u2019s decision to continue to support new and existing products. \nThe Company estimates sales incentives and other variable consideration using the most likely amount method and records accruals within Other accrued liabilities when control of the related product is transferred to the customer. Under this method, certain forms of variable consideration are based on expected sell-through results, which requires subjective estimates. These estimates are supported by historical results as well as specific facts and circumstances related to the current period.\nThe Company also enters into transactions and makes payments to certain of its customers related to demonstration, advertising and counter construction, some of which involve cooperative relationships with customers. These activities may be arranged either with unrelated third parties or in conjunction with the customer. To the extent the Company receives a distinct good or service in exchange for consideration and the fair value of the benefit can be reasonably estimated, the Company\u2019s share of the counter depreciation and the other costs of these transactions (regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. \nSee \nNote 14 \u2013 Revenue Recognition \nfor further discussion\n.\n For revenue disaggregated by product category and geographic region, see \nNote 22 \u2013 Segment Data and Related Information\n.\nRoyalty Revenue - License Arrangements\nAs a result of the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand, the Company entered into license arrangements with the Marcolin Group (\u201cMarcolin\u201d) and Ermenegildo Zegna N.V. (\u201cZegna\u201d). As part of these arrangements, the Company licensed the TOM FORD trademark for eyewear (\u201cEyewear\u201d) to Marcolin and for fashionwear (\u201cFashion\u201d) to Zegna. Licensing the TOM FORD trademark to customers represents a new revenue-generating activity in the ordinary course of business for the Company. \nThe Company\u2019s performance obligation is to license the TOM FORD trademark to Marcolin and to Zegna, which grants them the right to access the symbolic intellectual property. The licensing arrangements stipulate that licensees must pay a sales-based royalty, with a guaranteed minimum, to the Company.  The Company satisfies its performance obligation over the license period, as the Company fulfills its promise to grant the licensees rights to use and benefit from the intellectual property as well as maintain the intellectual property. As such, revenue for both the Marcolin and Zegna arrangements is recognized over time. Royalty payments are collected on a quarterly basis. The Company expects the guaranteed minimum royalty amounts to be exceeded and, as a result, sales-based royalties will be recognized in the period in which the sales occur. The upfront payment received from Marcolin is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the license. See \nNote 5 \u2013 Business and Asset Acquisitions \nand \nNote 14 - Revenue Recognition\n for further information regarding the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand.\nAdvertising and Promotion\nGlobal net advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development expenses of $\n3,711\n million, $\n3,877\n million and $\n3,710\n million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and are expensed as incurred. The cost of certain promotional products, including samples and testers, are classified within Cost of sales.\n\u00a0\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs of $\n344\n million, $\n307\n million and $\n243\n million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and are expensed as incurred.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling expenses of $\n838\n million, $\n860\n million and $\n680\n million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and include distribution center costs, promotional shipping costs, third-party logistics costs and outbound freight.\nRoyalty Fees - License Arrangements\nThe Company\u2019s license agreements provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof) using the licensors\u2019 trademarks.\u00a0The current license arrangements have an initial term of approximately \n5\n years to \n10\n years, and are renewable subject to the Company\u2019s compliance with the license agreement provisions.\u00a0As of June\u00a030, 2023, the remaining terms considering available renewal periods range from \n7\n years to approximately \n27\n years.\u00a0Under each license, the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based on net sales to third parties.\nCertain license agreements may require minimum royalty payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending on advertising and promotional activities.\u00a0Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are recognized while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs are incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company records stock-based compensation, measured at the fair value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest, as an expense in the consolidated financial statements, net of estimated forfeitures.\u00a0All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based compensation awards are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which it operates.\u00a0As the application of various tax laws relevant to the Company\u2019s global business is often uncertain, significant judgment is required in determining the Company\u2019s annual tax expense and in evaluating the Company\u2019s tax positions.\u00a0The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, net operating losses, tax credit and other carryforwards.\u00a0Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled.\u00a0The Company regularly reviews deferred tax assets for realizability and establishes valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and appropriate tax planning strategies.\u00a0If the Company\u2019s assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time, while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.\u00a0\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company provides tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit.\u00a0The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.\u00a0The Company assesses its tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management\u2019s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.\u00a0For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.\u00a0For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\u00a0The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.\u00a0Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management\u2019s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.\u00a0If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated net earnings.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nOn May 18, 2021, the Company acquired additional shares in Deciem Beauty Group Inc. (\n\u201cDECIEM\u201d\n), a Toronto-based skin care company. The Company originally acquired a minority interest in DECIEM in June 2017. The acquisition of additional shares increased the Company's equity interest and was considered a step acquisition. As part of the increase in the Company's investment, the Company was granted the right to purchase (\u201cCall Option\u201d), and granted the remaining investors a right to sell to the Company (\u201cPut Option\u201d), the remaining interests after a \nthree-yea\nr\n period, with a purchase price based on the future performance of DECIEM (the \u201cnet Put (Call) Option\u201d).\nAs a result of this redemption feature, the Company recorded redeemable noncontrolling interest, at its acquisition\u2011date fair value, that is classified as mezzanine equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The noncontrolling interest is adjusted each reporting period for income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest. Each reporting period, a measurement period adjustment, if any, is then recorded to adjust the noncontrolling interest to the higher of either the redemption value, assuming it was redeemable at the reporting date, or its carrying value. If and when applicable, these adjustments are recorded in Paid-in capital and are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. In addition, based on the Company's policy election, if the redemption value exceeds the fair value of the noncontrolling interest on a cumulative basis, a measurement period adjustment is recorded in Retained earnings and the Company will adjust Net earnings (loss) attributable to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. as it uses the two-class method when calculating earnings per common share. The fair value of the noncontrolling interest per share is calculated by incorporating significant assumptions including the starting equity value, revenue growth rates and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) and the following key assumptions into the Monte Carlo method: risk-free rate, term to mid of last twelve-month period, operating leverage adjustment, net sales discount rate, EBITDA discount rate, EBITDA volatility and net sales volatility. See \nNote 5 \u2013 Business and Asset Acquisitions\n for additional information regarding the redeemable noncontrolling interest.\nGovernment Assistance\nThe Company recognizes amounts received from government assistance programs as a reduction to cost of sales or operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings when there is reasonable assurance the Company will receive the amount and has met the conditions, if any, required by the government assistance program. Beginning in the second half of fiscal 2020, many governments in locations where the Company operates announced programs to assist employers whose businesses were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including programs that provide rebates to incentivize employers to maintain employees on payroll who were unable to work for their usual number of hours.\n During fiscal 2022 and 2021, the Company qualified for and recorded $\n12\n\u00a0million and $\n84\n\u00a0million, respectively, in government assistance, which reduced Selling, general and administrative expenses by $\n9\n\u00a0million and $\n78\n\u00a0million, respectively, and Cost of sales by $\n3\n\u00a0million and $\n6\n\u00a0million, respectively. In fiscal 2023, the impact from government assistance programs was not material to the consolidated statement of earnings.\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFASB ASU No. 2022-04 \u2013 Liabilities\u2014Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which is intended to enhance the transparency surrounding the use of supplier finance programs. The guidance requires companies that use supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the program\u2019s key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated rollforward information. Only the amount outstanding at the end of the period must be disclosed in interim periods. The guidance does not affect the recognition, measurement or financial statement presentation of supplier finance program obligations.\nEffective for the Company\n \u2013 The guidance becomes effective for the Company\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2024 and is applied on a retrospective basis, except for the requirement to disclose rollforward information annually which is effective prospectively for the Company beginning in fiscal 2025. Early adoption is permitted. Annual disclosures, excluding the rollforward information, need to be provided in interim periods within the initial year of adoption.\nImpact on consolidated financial statements \u2013\n The Company has supplier financing arrangements and will apply the disclosure requirements as required by the amendments.\nReference Rate Reform (ASC Topic 848 \n\u201c\nASC 848\n\u201d\n)\nIn March 2020, t\nhe FAS\nB issued authoritative guidance to provide optional relief for companies preparing for the discontinuation of interest rates such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and applies to lease and other contracts, hedging instruments, held-to-maturity debt securities and debt arrangements that reference LIBOR or another rate that is \nexpected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform.\nIn Janua\nry 2021, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that makes amendments to the new rules on accounting for reference rate reform. The amendments clar\nify that for all derivative instruments affected by the changes to interest rates used for discounting, margining or contract price alignment, regardless of whether they reference LIBOR or another rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform, an entity may apply certain practical expedients in ASC 848.\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to defer the sunset date of ASC 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024.\nEffective for the Company\n \u2013 This guidance can only be applied for a limited time through December 31, 2024.\nImpact on consolidated financial statements \u2013 \nThe Company completed its comprehensive evaluation of applying this guidance, and will adopt certain practical expedients for its interest rate swap agreements in the fiscal 2024 first quarter which is not expected to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements, including business processes and internal controls over financial reporting. The practical expedients that will be adopted permit its hedging relationships to continue without de-designation upon changes due to reference rate reform. Foreign currency forward contracts do not reference LIBOR and no practical expedients will be elected, but will be discounted using the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). For existing lease, debt arrangements and other contracts, the Company will not adopt any ASC 848 practical expedients as it relates to these arrangements. \nNo other recently issued accounting pronouncements are expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nF-20\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 \u2013 \nINVENTORY AND PROMOTIONAL MERCHANDISE\n \nInventory and promotional merchandise consists of the following:\nJune 30\n(In millions)\n2023\n2022\nRaw materials\n$\n876\n\u00a0\n$\n791\n\u00a0\nWork in process\n362\n\u00a0\n366\n\u00a0\nFinished goods\n1,404\n\u00a0\n1,449\n\u00a0\nPromotional merchandise\n337\n\u00a0\n314\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n2,979\n\u00a0\n$\n2,920\n\u00a0\nNOTE 4 \u2013 \nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT \nProperty, plant and equipment consists of the following:\nJune 30\n(In millions)\n2023\n2022\nAssets (Useful Life)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLand\n$\n70\n\u00a0\n$\n53\n\u00a0\nBuildings and improvements (\n10\n to \n40\n years)\n843\n\u00a0\n491\n\u00a0\nMachinery and equipment (\n3\n to \n10\n years)\n1,071\n\u00a0\n994\n\u00a0\nComputer hardware and software (\n4\n to \n10\n years)\n1,651\n\u00a0\n1,468\n\u00a0\nFurniture and fixtures (\n5\n to \n10\n years)\n136\n\u00a0\n129\n\u00a0\nLeasehold improvements\n2,310\n\u00a0\n2,246\n\u00a0\nConstruction in progress\n827\n\u00a0\n759\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n6,908\n\u00a0\n6,140\n\u00a0\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization\n(\n3,729\n)\n(\n3,490\n)\n\u00a0\n$\n3,179\n\u00a0\n$\n2,650\n\u00a0\nDepreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment was $\n577\n million, $\n543\n million and $\n516\n million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\u00a0Depreciation and amortization related to the Company\u2019s manufacturing process is included in Cost of sales and all other depreciation and amortization is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.

The TOM FORD brand is a luxury brand created in 2005, and this acquisition is expected to further strengthen the Company\u2019s TOM FORD BEAUTY brand, which the Company has historically licensed, while simultaneously enabling the Company to create new licensing revenue streams. At the same time as the Company's transaction, affiliates of the Ermenegildo Zegna Group (\u201cZegna\u201d) separately purchased the interests in the TOM FORD fashion business that Zegna did not own (including the purchase of interests from the sellers of 001).\nThe TOM FORD Acquisition has been accounted for as an asset acquisition as the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in the value of the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset. The acquisition of 001 included existing license relationships for certain uses of the brand name, which were modified, terminated or otherwise renegotiated in connection with the transaction, and are discussed separately in \nNote 14 \u2013 Revenue Recognition\n. \nThe total cost of the asset acquisition is $\n2,578\n\u00a0million, inclusive of approximately $\n28\n\u00a0million of transaction related costs and $\n300\n\u00a0million of deferred consideration payable to the sellers included in Other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2023. Of the $\n300\n\u00a0million of deferred consideration payable to the sellers, $\n150\n\u00a0million is due in July 2025 and the remaining $\n150\n\u00a0million is due in July 2026.\nThe total cost of the asset acquisition was allocated to the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset. The Company determined that the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset has an indefinite life, and will not be amortized, but will be subject to impairment assessment at least annually, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.\nBusiness Combination\nFiscal 2021\nOn May 18, 2021, the Company acquired additional shares in DECIEM, a Toronto-based skin care company, for $\n1,092\n\u00a0million in cash, including proceeds from the issuance of debt. DECIEM is a multi-brand beauty company with a brand portfolio that includes The Ordinary and NIOD. This acquisition is expected to further strengthen the Company\u2019s leadership position in prestige skin care, expand its global consumer reach and complement its business in the online and specialty-multi channels. The Company originally acquired a minority interest in DECIEM in June 2017. The minority interest was accounted for as an equity method investment, which had a carrying value of $\n65\n\u00a0million at the acquisition date. The acquisition of additional shares increased the Company's fully diluted equity interest from approximately \n29\n% to approximately \n76\n% and was considered a step acquisition. On a fully diluted basis, the DECIEM stock options, discussed below, approximated \n4\n% of the total capital structure. Accordingly, for purposes of determining the consideration transferred, the Company excluded the DECIEM stock options, which resulted in an increase in the Company\u2019s post-acquisition undiluted equity interest from approximately \n30\n% to approximately \n78\n% and the post-acquisition undiluted equity interest of the remaining noncontrolling interest holders of approximately \n22\n%. The Company remeasured the previously held equity method investment to its fair value of $\n913\n\u00a0million, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $\n848\n\u00a0million. The gain on the Company\u2019s previously held equity method investment is included in Other income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2021. As part of the increase in the Company's investment, the Company was granted the right to purchase (\u201cCall Option\u201d), and granted the remaining investors a right to sell to the Company (\u201cPut Option\u201d), the remaining interests after a \nthree-year\n period, with a purchase price based on the future performance of DECIEM (the \u201cnet Put (Call) Option\u201d). As a result of this redemption feature, the Company recorded redeemable noncontrolling interest, at its acquisition\u2011date fair value, that is classified as mezzanine equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2021. The accounting for the DECIEM business combination was finalized during the fiscal 2022 third quarter.\nF-22\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA summary of the total consideration transferred, including immaterial measurement period adjustments was finalized during the fiscal 2022 third quarter and recorded as follows:\n(In millions)\nMarch 31, 2022\nCash paid\n$\n1,095\n\u00a0\nFair value of DECIEM stock options liability \n104\n\u00a0\nFair value of net Put (Call) Option\n233\n\u00a0\nTotal consideration for the acquired ownership interest (approximately \n47.9\n%)\n1,432\n\u00a0\nFair value of previously held equity method investment (approximately \n30.5\n%) \n913\n\u00a0\nFair value of redeemable noncontrolling interest (approximately \n21.6\n%)\n647\n\u00a0\nTotal consideration transferred (\n100\n%)\n$\n2,992\n\u00a0\nAs part of the acquisition of additional shares, DECIEM stock options were issued in replacement of and exchange for certain vested and unvested stock options previously issued by DECIEM. The total fair value of the DECIEM stock options of $\n295\n\u00a0million was recorded as part of the total consideration transferred, comprising of $\n191\n\u00a0million of Cash paid for vested options settled as of the acquisition date and $\n104\n\u00a0million reported as a stock options liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as it is not an assumed liability of DECIEM and is expected to be settled in cash upon completion of the exercise of the Put (Call). The acquisition-date fair value of the DECIEM stock options liability was calculated by multiplying the acquisition-date fair value by the number of DECIEM stock options replaced the day after the acquisition date. The stock options replaced consist of vested and partially vested stock options. See \nNote 18 \u2013 Stock Programs \nfor information relating to the DECIEM stock options.\nThe acquisition-date fair value of the previously held equity method investment was calculated by multiplying the gross-up of the total consideration for the acquired ownership interest of $\n2,992\n\u00a0million by the related effective previously held equity interest of approximately \n30.5\n%.\nThe acquisition-date fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest includes the acquisition-date fair value of the net Put (Call) Option of $\n233\n\u00a0million. The remaining acquisition-date fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest of $\n647\n\u00a0million was calculated by multiplying the gross-up of the total consideration for the acquired ownership interest of $\n2,992\n\u00a0million by the related noncontrolling interest of approximately \n21.6\n%. \nThe acquisition-date fair values of the DECIEM stock options and the net Put (Call) Option were calculated by incorporating significant assumptions including the starting equity value, revenue growth rates and EBITDA and the following key assumptions into the Monte Carlo Method:\nMay 18, 2021\nRisk-free rate\n0.50\n%\nTerm to mid of last twelve-month period\n2.54\n years\nOperating leverage adjustment\n0.45\nNet sales discount rate\n3.30\n%\nEBITDA discount rate\n6.80\n%\nEBITDA volatility\n38.30\n%\nNet sales volatility\n17.20\n%\nF-23\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company recorded an allocation of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value at the acquisition date. The total consideration transferred includes the cash paid at closing, the fair value of its previously held equity method investment, the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest, including the fair value of the net Put (Call) Option, and the fair value of the DECIEM stock options liability. The excess of the total consideration transferred over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. To determine the acquisition date estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired, the Company applied the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method for customer relationships and the relief-from-royalty method for trademarks. The significant assumptions used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, and a customer attrition rate for customer relationships and royalty rates for trademarks. \nThe allocation of the total consideration transferred, including immaterial measurement period adjustments was finalized during the fiscal 2022 third quarter and recorded as follows:\n(In millions)\nMarch 31, 2022\nCash\n$\n35\n\u00a0\nAccounts receivable\n64\n\u00a0\nInventory\n190\n\u00a0\nOther current assets\n33\n\u00a0\nProperty, plant and equipment\n40\n\u00a0\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n40\n\u00a0\nIntangible assets\n1,917\n\u00a0\nGoodwill\n1,296\n\u00a0\nDeferred income taxes\n8\n\u00a0\nTotal assets acquired\n3,623\n\u00a0\nAccounts payable\n21\n\u00a0\nOperating lease liabilities \n8\n\u00a0\nOther accrued liabilities\n78\n\u00a0\nDeferred income taxes\n479\n\u00a0\nLong-term operating lease liabilities \n45\n\u00a0\nTotal liabilities assumed\n631\n\u00a0\nTotal consideration transferred\n$\n2,992\n\u00a0\nThe results of operations for DECIEM and acquisition-related costs were not material to the Company's consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2021.

The fair value of the trademark was determined using an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value were revenue growth rates, terminal value, beauty royalty savings, the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates. The most significant unobservable input was the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.\nAlso as discussed in \nNote 5 - Business and Asset Acquisitions,\n in May 2021 the Company increased its investment in DECIEM, which resulted in the inclusion of additional goodwill of $\n1,296\n\u00a0million, amortizable intangible assets (customer lists) of $\n701\n\u00a0million with amortization periods of \n7\n years to \n14\n years, and non-amortizable intangible assets (trademarks) of $\n1,216\n\u00a0million. Goodwill associated with the acquisition is primarily attributable to the future revenue growth opportunities associated with sales growth in the skin care category, as well as the value associated with DECIEM's assembled workforce. As such, the goodwill has been allocated to the Company\u2019s skin care product category. The goodwill recorded in connection with this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. \nThe intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of DECIEM are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The estimate of the fair values of the acquired amortizable intangible assets were determined using a multi-period excess earnings income approach by discounting the incremental after-tax cash flows over multiple periods. Fair value was determined under this approach by estimating future cash flows over multiple periods, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows. The estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets not subject to amortization were determined using an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset.\nF-25\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGoodwill\nThe Company assigns goodwill of a reporting unit to the product categories in which that reporting unit operates at the time of acquisition.\u00a0\nThe following table presents goodwill by product category and the related change in the carrying amount:\n(In millions)\nSkin Care\nMakeup\nFragrance\nHair Care\nTotal\nBalance as of June 30, 2021\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGoodwill\n$\n1,786\n$\n1,214\n$\n262\n$\n355\n$\n3,617\nAccumulated impairments\n(\n141\n)\n(\n830\n)\n(\n30\n)\n\u2014\n(\n1,001\n)\n\u00a0\n1,645\n384\n232\n355\n2,616\nGoodwill measurement period adjustment\n13\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n13\nTranslation and other adjustments, goodwill\n(\n97\n)\n(\n98\n)\n(\n13\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n210\n)\nTranslation and other adjustments, accumulated impairments\n3\n98\n1\n\u2014\n102\n\u00a0\n(\n81\n)\n\u2014\n(\n12\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n95\n)\nBalance as of June 30, 2022\nGoodwill\n1,702\n1,116\n249\n353\n3,420\nAccumulated impairments\n(\n138\n)\n(\n732\n)\n(\n29\n)\n\u2014\n(\n899\n)\n\u00a0\n1,564\n384\n220\n353\n2,521\nTranslation and other adjustments, goodwill\n(\n38\n)\n\u2014\n5\n\u2014\n(\n33\n)\nTranslation and other adjustments, accumulated impairments\n(\n1\n)\n\u2014\n(\n1\n)\n\u2014\n(\n2\n)\n\u00a0\n(\n39\n)\n\u2014\n4\n\u2014\n(\n35\n)\nBalance as of June 30, 2023\nGoodwill\n1,664\n1,116\n254\n353\n3,387\nAccumulated impairments\n(\n139\n)\n(\n732\n)\n(\n30\n)\n\u2014\n(\n901\n)\n\u00a0\n$\n1,525\n$\n384\n$\n224\n$\n353\n$\n2,486\nOther Intangible Assets\nOther intangible assets primarily include trademarks and customer lists, as well as patents, and license arrangements resulting from or related to businesses and assets purchased by the Company.\u00a0Indefinite-lived intangible assets (e.g., trademarks) are not subject to amortization and are assessed at least annually for impairment during the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.\u00a0Other intangible assets (e.g., customer lists) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected period of benefit, approximately \n7\n years to \n18\n years.\u00a0Intangible assets related to license agreements were amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on the terms of the respective agreements.\u00a0The costs incurred and expensed by the Company to extend or renew the term of acquired intangible assets during fiscal 2023 and 2022 were not material to the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nF-26\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOther intangible assets consist of the following:\nJune 30, 2023\nJune 30, 2022\n(In millions)\nGross\nCarrying\nValue\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nTotal Net\nBook Value\nGross\nCarrying\nValue\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nTotal Net\nBook Value\nAmortizable intangible assets:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCustomer lists, license agreements and other\n$\n2,030\n\u00a0\n$\n766\n\u00a0\n$\n1,264\n\u00a0\n$\n2,064\n\u00a0\n$\n628\n\u00a0\n$\n1,436\n\u00a0\nNon-amortizable intangible assets:\nTrademarks\n4,338\n\u00a0\n1,992\n\u00a0\nTotal intangible assets\n$\n5,602\n\u00a0\n$\n3,428\n\u00a0\nThe aggregate amortization expense related to amortizable intangible assets for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n145\n million, $\n160\n million and $\n110\n million, respectively.\u00a0\nThe estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years is as follows:\n\u00a0\nFiscal\n(In millions)\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\nEstimated aggregate amortization expense\n$\n146\n\u00a0\n$\n146\n\u00a0\n$\n146\n\u00a0\n$\n129\n\u00a0\n$\n104\n\u00a0\nFiscal 2023 Impairment Analysis\nFor further policy information on the Company's policy relating to its impairment assessment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, see \nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\n within \nNote 2 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nDuring the fiscal 2023 second quarter, given the lower-than-expected results in the overall business, the Company revised the internal forecasts relating to its Smashbox reporting unit. The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark intangible asset.

In addition, due to macro-economic factors, Dr.Jart+ has experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions. The Too Faced reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected results in key geographic regions and channels coupled with delays in future international expansion to areas that continue to be impacted by COVID-19. As a result, the Company revised the internal forecasts relating to its Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced reporting units. Additionally, there were increases in the weighted average cost of capital for both reporting units as compared to the prior year annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2022. \nF-27\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting units, along with increases in the weighted average cost of capital, triggered the need for interim impairment reviews of their trademarks and goodwill. These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of Dr.Jart+\u2019s and Too Faced\u2019s long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed interim impairment tests for the trademarks and a recoverability test for the long-lived assets as of November 30, 2022. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of $\n100\n\u00a0million for Dr.Jart+ and $\n86\n\u00a0million for Too Faced. The Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets were recoverable. After adjusting the carrying values of the trademarks, the Company completed interim quantitative impairment tests for goodwill. As the estimated fair value of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced reporting units were in excess of their carrying values, the Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the goodwill were recoverable and did not record a goodwill impairment charge related to these reporting units. The fair values of these reporting units were based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting units. The significant assumptions used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, comparable market multiples and royalty rates for trademarks.

These changes were an indicator that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed a recoverability test by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value. For those freestanding stores that failed step one of this test, the Company then compared the assets carrying values to their estimated fair values. Specifically, for the related ROU assets, the fair value was based on discounting market rent using a real estate discount rate. As a result, the Company recognized $\n71\n\u00a0million of long-lived asset impairments, included in \nImpairments of other intangible and long-lived assets\n, in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2021.

The PCBA Program is designed to help improve efficiency and effectiveness by rebalancing resources to growth areas of prestige beauty. It is expected to further strengthen the Company by building upon the foundational capabilities in which the Company has invested.\nThe PCBA Program\u2019s main areas of focus include accelerating the shift to online with the realignment of the Company\u2019s distribution network reflecting freestanding store and certain department store closures, with a focus on North America and Europe, the Middle East & Africa; the reduction in brick-and-mortar point of sale employees and related support staff; and the redesign of the Company\u2019s regional branded marketing organizations, plus select opportunities in global brands and functions. This program is expected to position the Company to better execute its long-term strategy while strengthening its financial flexibility.\nF-34\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company estimated a net reduction over the duration of the PCBA Program in the range of \n2,800\n to \n3,200\n positions globally, including temporary and part-time employees. This reduction takes into account the elimination of some positions, retraining and redeployment of certain employees and investment in new positions in key areas. The Company also estimated the closure over the duration of the PCBA Program of approximately \n14\n% to \n17\n% of its freestanding stores globally, primarily in North America and Europe, the Middle East & Africa.\nThe Company approved specific initiatives under the PCBA Program through fiscal 2022 and has substantially completed those initiatives through fiscal 2023. Inclusive of approvals from inception through June 30, 2022, the Company estimates, as of June 30, 2023, that the PCBA Program will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $\n450\n\u00a0million and $\n480\n\u00a0million, before taxes. \nSpecific actions taken since the PCBA Program inception include:\n\u2022\nOptimize Digital Organization and Other Go-To-Market Organizations\n \u2013 The Company approved initiatives to enhance its go-to-market capabilities and shift more resources to support online growth. These actions are substantially complete and have resulted in a net reduction of the workforce, which includes position eliminations, the re-leveling of certain positions and an investment in new capabilities. \n\u2022\nOptimize Select Marketing, Brand and Global Functions\n \u2013 The Company has started to reduce its corporate and certain of its brand office footprints and is moving toward the future of work in a post-COVID-19 environment, by restructuring where and how its employees work and collaborate. In addition, the Company has approved initiatives to reduce organizational complexity and leverage scale across various Global functions. These actions are substantially complete and resulted in asset write-offs, employee severance, lease termination fees, and consulting and other professional services for the design and implementation of the future structures and processes. \n\u2022\nOptimize Distribution Network\n \u2013 To help restore profitability to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels in certain areas of its distribution network and, as part of a broader initiative to be completed in phases, the Company has approved initiatives to close a number of underperforming freestanding stores, counters and other retail locations, mainly in certain affiliates across all geographic regions, including the Company's travel retail network. These closures reflect changing consumer behaviors including higher demand for online and omnichannel capabilities. These activities are substantially complete and resulted in product returns, termination of contracts, a net reduction in workforce, and inventory and other asset write-offs.\n\u2022\nExit of the Global Distribution of BECCA Products\n \u2013 In reviewing the Company's brand portfolio to improve efficiency and the sustainability of long-term investments, the decision was made to exit the global distribution of BECCA products due to its limited distribution, the ongoing decline in product demand and the challenging environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These activities resulted in charges for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, product returns, termination of contracts, and employee severance. The Company completed these initiatives during fiscal 2022.\n\u2022\nExit of Certain Designer Fragrance Licenses\n \u2013 In reviewing the Company\u2019s brand portfolio of fragrances and to focus on investing its resources on alternative opportunities for long-term growth and value creation globally, the Company announced that it would not be renewing its existing license agreements for the Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Tommy Hilfiger and Ermenegildo Zegna product lines when their respective terms expire in June 2023. The Company negotiated early termination agreements with each of the licensors effective June 30, 2022 and continued to sell products under these licenses until such time. These actions resulted in asset write-offs, including charges for the impairment of goodwill, employee-related costs, and consulting and legal fees.\n\u2022\nBrand Transformation\n \u2013 In reviewing the Company\u2019s brand portfolio to accelerate growth within the makeup product category and to support long-term investments, the decision was made to strategically reposition Smashbox to capitalize on changing consumer preferences and to mitigate the impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the brand. These actions are substantially complete and have primarily resulted in product returns and inventory write-offs.\nPCBA Program Restructuring and Other Charges\nRestructuring charges are comprised of the following:\nEmployee-Related Costs \u2013\n Employee-related costs are primarily comprised of severance and other post-employment benefit costs, calculated based on salary levels, prior service and other statutory minimum benefits, if applicable.\nF-35\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAsset-Related Costs\n \u2013 Asset-related costs primarily consist of asset write-offs or accelerated depreciation related to long-lived assets in certain freestanding stores (including rights associated with commercial operating leases and operating lease right-of-use assets) that will be taken out of service prior to their existing useful life as a direct result of a restructuring initiative. These costs also include goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges relating to the exit of the global distribution of BECCA products.\nContract Terminations\n \u2013 Costs related to contract terminations include continuing payments to a third party after the Company has ceased benefiting from the rights conveyed in the contract, or a payment made to terminate a contract prior to its expiration. \nOther Exit Costs\n \u2013 Other exit costs related to restructuring activities generally include costs to relocate facilities or employees, recruiting to fill positions as a result of relocation of operations, and employee outplacement for separated employees. \nOther charges associated with restructuring activities are comprised of the following:\nSales Returns and Cost of Sales\n \u2013 Product returns (offset by the related cost of sales) and inventory write-offs or write-downs as a direct result of an approved restructuring initiative to exit certain businesses or locations will be recorded as a component of Net sales and/or Cost of sales when estimable and reasonably assured. \nOther Charges\n \u2013 The Company approved other charges related to the design and implementation of approved initiatives, which are charged to Operating expenses as incurred and primarily include the following:\n\u2022\nConsulting and other professional services for organizational design of the future structures and processes as well as the implementation thereof;\n\u2022\nTemporary labor backfill;\n\u2022\nCosts to establish and maintain a PMO for the duration of the PCBA Program, including internal costs for employees dedicated solely to project management activities, and other PMO-related expenses incremental to the Company\u2019s ongoing operations (e.g., rent and utilities);

The excise tax was effective beginning with the Company\u2019s third quarter of fiscal 2023 and did not have an impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial position.

The Company historically had not provided for deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as they were considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in connection with a planned change in the Company's legal entity structure that exempts foreign withholding tax on certain undistributed earnings, the Company changed its assertion regarding its ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and determined that $\n5,548\n\u00a0million of undistributed earnings of such foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested.

The treasury lock agreements were settled upon the issuance of the new debt, and the Company recognized a loss in OCI of $\n5\n\u00a0million that is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the May 2033 Senior Notes. As a result of the treasury lock agreements, as well as the debt discount and debt issuance costs, the effective interest rate on the May 2033 Senior Notes will be\u00a0\n4.83\n% over the life of the debt.\n(10)\nThe Senior Notes contain certain customary covenants, including limitations on indebtedness secured by liens.\nIn January 2023, the Company entered into a $\n2,000\n\u00a0million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \u201c364-Day Facility\u201d) to support the Company's commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes, including to finance the Company's fiscal 2023 fourth quarter TOM FORD Acquisition. In January 2023, in connection with the 364-Day Facility, the Company increased its commercial paper program under which it may issue commercial paper in the United States from $\n2,500\n\u00a0million to $\n4,500\n\u00a0million. \nIn May 2023, the Company completed a public offering of $\n2,000\n\u00a0million, consisting of $\n700\n\u00a0million aggregate principal amount of its 2028 Senior Notes, $\n700\n\u00a0million aggregate principal amount of its May 2033 Senior Notes and $\n600\n\u00a0million aggregate principal amount of its 2053 Senior Notes. The Company used proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including to repay outstanding commercial paper as it matured. \nIn June 2023, the Company decreased the size of its commercial paper program to $\n2,500\n\u00a0million and terminated the undrawn $\n2,000\n\u00a0million 364-Day Facility. \nAs of June 30, 2023 and August 11, 2023, the Company had $\n1,000\n\u00a0million and $\n785\n\u00a0million, respectively, outstanding under its commercial paper program, which may be refinanced on a periodic basis as it matures at the then-prevailing market interest rates. Proceeds from issuance of commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days were $\n765\n\u00a0million during fiscal 2023. On August 14, 2023, the Company issued an additional $\n215\n\u00a0million of commercial paper under its commercial paper program. \nOn August 15, 2022, the Company repaid the outstanding principal balance of its $\n250\n\u00a0million \n2.35\n% Senior Notes with cash from operations.\nIn October\u00a02021, the Company replaced its $\n1,500\n million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire in October\u00a02023 with a new $\n2,500\n million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \u201cNew Facility\u201d).\u00a0The New Facility expires on October\u00a022, 2026 unless extended for up to \ntwo\n additional years in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement.\u00a0Up to the equivalent of $\n750\n million of the New Facility is available for multi-currency loans.\u00a0Interest rates on borrowings under the New Facility will be based on prevailing market interest rates in accordance with the agreement.\u00a0The costs incurred to establish the New Facility were not material. The New Facility has an annual fee of approximately $\n1\n million, payable quarterly, based on the Company\u2019s current credit ratings.\u00a0The New Facility contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $\n175\n\u00a0million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility.\u00a0The New Facility may be increased, at the election of the Company, by up to $\n500\n\u00a0million in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement. At June\u00a030, 2023, \nno\n borrowings were outstanding under the New Facility.  \nThe Company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world.\u00a0Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings.\u00a0During fiscal 2023 and 2022, the average amount outstanding was approximately $\n1\n million and $\n8\n million, respectively, and the annualized weighted-average interest rate incurred was approximately \n5.4\n% and \n10.2\n%, respectively.\nRefer to \nNote 16 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\n for the Company\u2019s projected debt service payments, as of June\u00a030, 2023, over the next five fiscal years.\nF-45\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 12 \u2013 \nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.\u00a0The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts, and may enter into option contracts, to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses cross-currency swap contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency changes on certain intercompany foreign currency denominated debt.\u00a0In addition, the Company enters into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company\u2019s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances.\u00a0The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations, which are designated as net investment hedges. The Company enters into the net investment hedges to offset the risk of changes in the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s investment in these foreign operations due to fluctuating foreign exchange rates. Time value is excluded from the effectiveness assessment and is recognized under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The net gain or loss on net investment hedges is recorded within translation adjustments, as a component of AOCI on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets, until the sale or substantially complete liquidation of the underlying assets of the Company\u2019s investment. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts, and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\u00a0At June\u00a030, 2023, the notional amount of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments was $\n3,667\n million. The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\u00a0Costs associated with entering into derivative financial instruments have not been material to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial results.\nFor each derivative contract entered into, where the Company looks to obtain hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally and contemporaneously documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the hedging instruments\u2019 effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively.\u00a0This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.\u00a0At inception, the Company evaluates the effectiveness of hedge relationships quantitatively, and has elected to perform, after initial evaluation, qualitative effectiveness assessments of certain hedge relationships to support an ongoing expectation of high effectiveness, if effectiveness testing is required.\u00a0If based on the qualitative assessment, it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will perform a quantitative assessment to determine whether to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.\nF-46\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

At June\u00a030, 2023, the Company had cash flow hedges outstanding with a notional amount totaling $\n1,981\n million.\nThe Company may enter into interest rate forward contracts to hedge anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the Company\u2019s identified exposures.\u00a0The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of interest rate movements on the cost of debt issuance.\nFor foreign currency hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to Net sales when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.\u00a0If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in AOCI are reclassified to current-period Net sales.\u00a0As of June\u00a030, 2023, the Company\u2019s foreign currency cash flow hedges were highly effective.\nThe estimated net gain on the Company\u2019s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as of June\u00a030, 2023 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $\n25\n million.\u00a0The accumulated net gain on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in AOCI was $\n79\n million and $\n90\n million as of June\u00a030, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness.\u00a0At June 30, 2023, the Company has interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $\n700\n million and $\n300\n\u00a0million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its 2030 Senior Notes and 2031 Senior Notes, respectively, to variable interest rates based on \nthree-month\n LIBOR plus a margin.\u00a0These interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt, and the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.\nF-50\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company enters into cross-currency swap contracts to manage the exposure of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on its intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. At June 30, 2023, the Company has cross-currency swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $\n491\n\u00a0million, to hedge the impact of foreign currency changes on certain intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. The cross-currency swap contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the related intercompany debt, and the gains and losses representing hedge components included in the assessment of effectiveness are presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized over the life of the hedge on a systematic and rational basis. The earnings recognition of excluded components is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transaction. Any difference between the changes in the fair value of the excluded components and amounts recognized in earnings will be recognized in AOCI.\nThe estimated net gain on the Company\u2019s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges as of June 30, 2023 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $\n14\n\u00a0million. The accumulated net loss on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in AOCI was $\n20\n\u00a0million as of June 30, 2023.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts, designated as net investment hedges, to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations. The net gain or loss on these contracts is recorded within translation adjustments, as a component of AOCI on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the Company\u2019s net investment in these foreign operations. The net investment hedge contracts have varying maturities through the end of November 2023. Hedge effectiveness of the net investment hedge contracts is based on the spot method. At June\u00a030, 2023, the Company had net investment hedges outstanding with a notional amount totaling $\n1,082\n million.\nCredit Risk\nAs a matter of policy, the Company enters into derivative contracts only with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least \ntwo\n nationally recognized rating agencies.\u00a0The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.\u00a0Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $\n98\n million at June\u00a030, 2023. To manage this risk, the Company has strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.\u00a0Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.\nF-51\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 13 \u2013 \nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company records certain of its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\u00a0The accounting for fair value measurements must be applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that require initial measurement or remeasurement at fair value, which principally consist of assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations and goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for the purposes of calculating potential impairment.\u00a0The Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\u00a0The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel\u00a01:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.\nLevel\u00a02:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel\u00a03:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inputs reflect management\u2019s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.

To determine the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted using LIBOR for contracts with maturities up to \n12\n months, and swap yield curves for contracts with maturities greater than \n12\n months.\nF-54\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCross-currency swap contracts -\n The fair value of the Company\u2019s cross-currency swap contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on the income approach. The significant observable inputs to the model, such as yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from independent pricing services.\nInterest rate-related derivatives \u2013\n The fair values of the Company\u2019s interest rate contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on the income approach.\u00a0The significant observable inputs to the model, such as treasury yield curves, swap yield curves and LIBOR forward rates, were obtained from independent pricing services.\nCurrent and long-term debt\n \u2013 The fair value of the Company\u2019s debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities.\u00a0To a lesser extent, debt also includes finance lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value.\u00a0The Company\u2019s debt is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\nDeferred consideration payable \n\u2013\n The deferred consideration payable as of June 30, 2023 consists primarily of deferred payments associated with the TOM FORD Acquisition. The fair value of the payments treated as deferred consideration payable are calculated based on the net present value of cash payments using an estimated borrowing rate based on quoted prices for a similar liability. The Company\u2019s deferred consideration payable is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to \nNote 5 \u2013 Business and Asset Acquisitions\n for additional information associated with the TOM FORD Acquisition.\nDECIEM stock options\n \u2013 The stock option liability represents the employee stock options issued by DECIEM in replacement and exchange for certain vested and unvested DECIEM employee stock options previously issued by DECIEM, in connection with the Company's acquisition of DECIEM. The DECIEM stock options are subject to the terms and conditions of DECIEM's 2021 Stock Option Plan. The DECIEM stock option liability is measured using the Monte Carlo Method, which requires certain assumptions. Significant changes in the projected future operating results would result in a higher or lower fair value measurement. Changes to the discount rates or volatilities would have a lesser effect. These inputs are categorized as Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The DECIEM stock options are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date through the period when the options are exercised or repurchased (i.e., when they are settled), with an offsetting entry to compensation expense.

Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.\u00a0The discount rate for the Company\u2019s Domestic Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.\u00a0The Company used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of the Company\u2019s Domestic Plans.\u00a0For the Company\u2019s international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.\u00a0In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, the Company considers the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan\u2019s investments and an expectation for the plan\u2019s investment strategies.\nThe weighted-average interest crediting rate used to determine the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost relating to the Company\u2019s U.S. Retirement Growth Account Plan was \n4.00\n% and \n4.02\n% as of and for the years ended June\u00a030, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nAssumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.\u00a0The assumed weighted-average health care cost trend rate for the coming year is \n5.54\n% while the weighted-average ultimate trend rate of \n4.02\n% is expected to be reached in approximately \n17\n years to \n23\n years.\u00a0\nAmounts recognized in AOCI (before tax) as of June\u00a030, 2023 are as

valuation methodologies used for plan assets measured at fair value:\nCash and Cash Equivalents \u2013\n Cash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash deposits in interest bearing accounts, time deposits and money market funds.\u00a0These assets are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\nShort-term investment funds \u2013\n The fair values are determined using the Net Asset Value (\u201cNAV\u201d) provided by the administrator of the fund when the Company has the ability to redeem the assets at the measurement date.\u00a0These assets are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\u00a0For some assets the Company is utilizing the NAV as a practical expedient and those investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy.\nGovernment and agency securities \u2013\n The fair values are determined using third-party pricing services using market prices or prices derived from observable market inputs such as benchmark curves, broker/dealer quotes, and other industry and economic factors.\u00a0These investments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\nF-61\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCommingled funds \u2013\n The fair values of publicly traded funds are based upon market quotes and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\u00a0The fair values for non-publicly traded funds are determined using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund when the Company has the ability to redeem the assets at the measurement date.\u00a0These assets are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\u00a0When the Company is utilizing the NAV as a practical expedient those investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy.\u00a0These investments have monthly redemption frequencies with redemption notice periods ranging from \n10\n to \n30\n days.\u00a0There are no unfunded commitments related to these investments.\nInsurance contracts \u2013\n The fair values are based on negotiated value and the underlying investments held in separate account portfolios, as well as the consideration of the creditworthiness of the issuer.\u00a0The underlying investments are primarily government, asset-backed and fixed income securities.\u00a0Insurance contracts are generally classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices or other observable inputs for pricing.\nInterests in limited partnerships and hedge fund investments\n \u2013 The fair values are determined using the NAV provided by the administrator as a practical expedient, and therefore these investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy.\u00a0These investments have monthly and quarterly redemption frequencies with redemption notice periods ranging from \n30\n to \n90\n days.\u00a0Unfunded commitments related to these investments are de minimis.\nThe following table presents the fair values of the Company\u2019s pension and post-retirement plan assets by asset category as of

yield\n0.8\n%\n0.7\n%\n1.0\n%\nThe Company uses a weighted-average expected stock-price volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock.\u00a0The implied volatilities were obtained from publicly available data sources.\u00a0For the weighted-average expected option life assumption, the Company considers the exercise behavior for past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises.\u00a0The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rate for the expected term of the options and the average dividend yield is based on historical experience. \nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Company granted RSUs in respect of approximately \n1.1\n million shares of Class A Common Stock during fiscal 2023 with a weighted-average grant date fair value per share of $\n246.20\n that, at the time of grant, are scheduled to vest as follows: \n0.4\n million in fiscal 2024, \n0.3\n million in fiscal 2025

INFORMATION\nReportable operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the \u201cChief Executive\u201d) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\u00a0As a result of the similarities in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for all of the Company\u2019s products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Chief Executive.\u00a0Although the Company operates in \none\n business segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product category basis. While the Company\u2019s results of operations are also reviewed on a consolidated basis, the Chief Executive reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to industry statistics.\u00a0Accordingly, net sales, depreciation and amortization, and operating income are available with respect to the manufacture and distribution of skin care, makeup, fragrance, hair care and other products.\u00a0These product categories meet the definition of operating segments and, accordingly, additional financial data are provided below.\u00a0The other segment includes the sales and related results of ancillary products and services that do not fit the definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care, including royalty revenue associated with the license of the TOM FORD trademark as discussed in \nNote 14 - Revenue Recognition\n. Product category performance is measured based upon net sales before returns associated with restructuring and other activities, and earnings before income taxes, other components of net periodic benefit cost, interest expense, interest income and investment income, net, other income, net and charges associated with restructuring and other activities.\u00a0Returns and charges associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to the Company's product categories or geographic regions because they are centrally directed and controlled, are not included in internal measures of product category or geographic region performance and result from activities that are deemed Company-wide initiatives to redesign, resize and reorganize select areas of the business.\n\u00a0 \nThe accounting policies for the Company\u2019s reportable segments are substantially the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, except for depreciation and amortization charges, which are allocated, primarily, based upon net sales.\u00a0The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced for the Chief Executive or included herein.\nF-75\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\u00a0\nYear Ended June 30\n(In\u00a0millions)\n2023\n2022\n2021\nPRODUCT CATEGORY DATA\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNet sales:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSkin Care\n$\n8,202\n\u00a0\n$\n9,886\n\u00a0\n$\n9,484\n\u00a0\nMakeup\n4,516\n\u00a0\n4,667\n\u00a0\n4,203\n\u00a0\nFragrance\n2,512\n\u00a0\n2,508\n\u00a0\n1,926\n\u00a0\nHair Care\n653\n\u00a0\n631\n\u00a0\n571\n\u00a0\nOther\n54\n\u00a0\n49\n\u00a0\n45\n\u00a0\n15,937\n\u00a0\n17,741\n\u00a0\n16,229\n\u00a0\nReturns associated with restructuring and other activities\n(\n27\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n14\n)\nNet sales\n$\n15,910\n\u00a0\n$\n17,737\n\u00a0\n$\n16,215\n\u00a0\nDepreciation and amortization:\nSkin Care\n$\n383\n\u00a0\n$\n404\n\u00a0\n$\n330\n\u00a0\nMakeup\n211\n\u00a0\n213\n\u00a0\n210\n\u00a0\nFragrance\n117\n\u00a0\n89\n\u00a0\n78\n\u00a0\nHair Care\n31\n\u00a0\n20\n\u00a0\n31\n\u00a0\nOther\n2\n\u00a0\n1\n\u00a0\n2\n\u00a0\n$\n744\n\u00a0\n$\n727\n\u00a0\n$\n651\n\u00a0\nOperating income (loss) before charges associated with restructuring and other activities:\nSkin Care\n$\n1,204\n\u00a0\n$\n2,753\n\u00a0\n$\n3,036\n\u00a0\nMakeup\n(\n22\n)\n133\n\u00a0\n(\n384\n)\nFragrance\n440\n\u00a0\n456\n\u00a0\n215\n\u00a0\nHair Care\n(\n34\n)\n(\n28\n)\n(\n19\n)\nOther\n6\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n(\n2\n)\n1,594\n\u00a0\n3,314\n\u00a0\n2,846\n\u00a0\nReconciliation:\nCharges associated with restructuring and other activities\n(\n85\n)\n(\n144\n)\n(\n228\n)\nInterest expense\n(\n255\n)\n(\n167\n)\n(\n173\n)\nInterest income and investment income, net\n131\n\u00a0\n30\n\u00a0\n51\n\u00a0\nOther components of net periodic benefit cost\n12\n\u00a0\n2\n\u00a0\n(\n12\n)\nOther income, net\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n1\n\u00a0\n847\n\u00a0\nEarnings before income taxes\n$\n1,397\n\u00a0\n$\n3,036\n\u00a0\n$\n3,331\n\u00a0\nF-76\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\u00a0\nYear Ended June 30\n(In\u00a0millions)\n2023\n2022\n2021\nGEOGRAPHIC DATA\n(1)\nNet sales:\nThe Americas\n$\n4,518\n\u00a0\n$\n4,623\n\u00a0\n$\n3,797\n\u00a0\nEurope, the Middle East\u00a0& Africa\n6,225\n\u00a0\n7,681\n\u00a0\n6,946\n\u00a0\nAsia/Pacific\n5,194\n\u00a0\n5,437\n\u00a0\n5,486\n\u00a0\n15,937\n\u00a0\n17,741\n\u00a0\n16,229\n\u00a0\nReturns associated with restructuring and other activities\n(\n27\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n14\n)\nNet sales\n$\n15,910\n\u00a0\n$\n17,737\n\u00a0\n$\n16,215\n\u00a0\nOperating income (loss):\nThe Americas\n$\n(\n73\n)\n$\n1,159\n\u00a0\n$\n518\n\u00a0\nEurope, the Middle East\u00a0& Africa\n843\n\u00a0\n1,360\n\u00a0\n1,335\n\u00a0\nAsia/Pacific\n824\n\u00a0\n795\n\u00a0\n993\n\u00a0\n1,594\n\u00a0\n3,314\n\u00a0\n2,846\n\u00a0\nCharges associated with restructuring and other activities\n(\n85\n)\n(\n144\n)\n(\n228\n)\nOperating income\n$\n1,509\n\u00a0\n$\n3,170\n\u00a0\n$\n2,618\n\u00a0\nTotal assets:\nThe Americas\n$\n13,292\n\u00a0\n$\n10,989\n\u00a0\n$\n11,387\n\u00a0\nEurope, the Middle East\u00a0& Africa\n5,985\n\u00a0\n5,781\n\u00a0\n5,907\n\u00a0\nAsia/Pacific\n4,138\n\u00a0\n4,140\n\u00a0\n4,677\n\u00a0\n$\n23,415\n\u00a0\n$\n20,910\n\u00a0\n$\n21,971\n\u00a0\nLong-lived assets\n(2)\n:\nThe Americas\n$\n2,593\n\u00a0\n$\n2,609\n\u00a0\n$\n2,521\n\u00a0\nEurope, the Middle East\u00a0& Africa\n1,202\n\u00a0\n1,133\n\u00a0\n1,314\n\u00a0\nAsia/Pacific\n1,181\n\u00a0\n857\n\u00a0\n635\n\u00a0\n$\n4,976\n\u00a0\n$\n4,599\n\u00a0\n$\n4,470\n\u00a0\n(1)\nThe net sales from the Company\u2019s travel retail business are included in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa region, with the exception of net sales of Dr.Jart+ in the travel retail channel that are reflected in Korea in the Asia/Pacific region.

    "item1a": ">Item 1A.\u00a0 \nRisk Factors.\nThere are risks associated with an investment in our securities.\u00a0Please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on Form\u00a010-K and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).\u00a0Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial.\u00a0If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop, our business, which includes our prospects, financial condition and results of operations, the trading prices of our securities and our reputation, may be adversely affected.\nRisks related to our Business and our Industry\nThe beauty business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.\nWe face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multinational consumer product companies.\u00a0Some competitors have greater resources than we do, others are newer companies (some backed by private-equity investors), and some are competing in distribution channels where we are less represented.\u00a0In some cases, we may not be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions as quickly as our competitors.\u00a0Competition in the beauty business is based on a variety of factors including pricing of products, innovation, perceived value, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce and m-commerce initiatives and other activities.\u00a0It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors\u2019 actions in these areas.\nOur ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business.\u00a0Our Company has a well-recognized and strong reputation that could be negatively impacted by social media and many other factors.\u00a0If our reputation is adversely affected, our ability to attract and retain customers, consumers and employees could be impacted.\u00a0In addition, certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands.\u00a0Our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world (e.g., China) could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and cost-effective manner to changes in consumer preferences for skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, attitudes toward our industry and brands, as well as to where and how consumers shop.\u00a0We must continually work to develop, manufacture and market new products, maintain and adapt our \u201cHigh-Touch\u201d services to existing and emerging distribution channels, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, successfully manage our inventories, and modernize and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products.\u00a0We recognize that consumer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly, driven by the use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared.\u00a0If we are unable to anticipate and respond to challenges that we may face in the marketplace, trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment, our financial results will suffer.\u00a0In addition, from time to time, sales growth or profitability may be concentrated in a relatively small number of our brands, channels or countries (e.g., China).\u00a0If such a situation persists or one or more brands, channels or countries fails to perform as expected, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn certain key markets, such as the United States, we have seen a longer-term decline in retail traffic in our department store customers.\u00a0Consolidation or liquidation in the retail trade, from these or other factors, may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers and could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers.\u00a0A severe, adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us.\u00a0If one or more of our largest customers change their strategies (including pricing or promotional activities), enter bankruptcy (or similar proceedings) or if our relationship with any large customer is changed or terminated for any reason, there could be a material adverse effect on our business. \n18\nTable of Contents\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to achieve our long-term strategy.\nAchieving our long-term strategy will require investment in new capabilities, brands, categories, distribution channels, supply chain facilities, technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets (e.g., China).\u00a0These investments may result in short-term costs without any current sales and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings.\u00a0In addition, we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so.\u00a0Although we believe that our strategy will lead to long-term growth in sales and profitability, we may not realize the anticipated benefits.\u00a0The failure to realize benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute plans, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAcquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional risks.\nWe continuously review acquisition and strategic investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings, our distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities.\u00a0In addition, we periodically review our brand portfolio, and our strategy includes potential divestitures of certain brands as we rationalize product offerings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify these strategic actions and consummate such transactions on favorable terms.\u00a0\nAcquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks, which may include: (i) difficulties in integrating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from, or customers, consumers or suppliers of, acquired businesses; (ii) diversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing businesses; (iii) adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, customers and consumers of ours or the companies in which we invest; (iv) adverse impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business; (v) reputational risks associated with the activities of the businesses that we acquire or in which we invest; and (vi) risks of entering distribution channels, categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.\nIf required, the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our stockholders or both.\u00a0The purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future, a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business.\u00a0If the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results, then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts.\nCompleted acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet. We are required at least annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred.\u00a0We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets.\u00a0Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to achieve the long-term plan for acquired businesses, as well as any other adverse consequences associated with our acquisition, divestiture and investment activities, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by social impact and sustainability matters.\nThere is an increased focus from certain investors, customers, consumers, regulators, employees, and other stakeholders concerning social impact and sustainability and other ESG matters.\u00a0From time to time, we announce certain initiatives, including goals and commitments, regarding our focus areas, which include environmental and climate matters; packaging; sourcing; product formulation; social investments; and inclusion, diversity and equity.\u00a0We could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives, or in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives.\u00a0Such failures could be due to changes in our business (e.g., shifts in business among distribution channels or acquisitions). Moreover, the standards by which ESG efforts and related matters are measured are developing and evolving, and certain areas are subject to assumptions that could change over time. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of our initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. Any such matters, or related ESG matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n19\nTable of Contents\nA general economic downturn, or disruption in business conditions may affect our business including consumer purchases of discretionary items and/or the financial strength of our customers that are retailers, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control.\u00a0Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products.\u00a0A decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers.\u00a0We generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.\u00a0However, the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer.\u00a0We may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer.\u00a0In the event of a retailer liquidation, we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer\u2019s inventory of our products to protect brand equity. Our inability to collect receivables from our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\u00a0\nIn addition, disruptions in local or global business conditions, for example, from events such as a pandemic or other health issues, geo-political or local conflicts, civil unrest, terrorist attacks, adverse weather conditions, climate changes or seismic events, can have a short-term and, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending.\nEvents that impact consumers\u2019 willingness or ability to travel or purchase our products while traveling may impact our business, including travel retail, a significant contributor to our overall results, and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations.\nA downturn in the economies of, or continuing recessions in, the countries where we sell our products or a disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence, the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability.\u00a0We are also cautious of foreign currency movements, including their impact on tourism.\u00a0Additionally, we continue to monitor the effects of the global macroeconomic environment; social, political and human rights issues; regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs or sanctions; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues.\nVolatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business.\u00a0While we typically generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, credit markets may experience significant disruptions.\u00a0Deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive.\u00a0If any financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements, such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us.\u00a0This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products. If our products are found to be defective or unsafe, our product claims are found to be deceptive, or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers\u2019 expectations, our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose sales and become subject to liability or claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, counterfeit versions of some of our products may be sold by third parties, which may pose safety risks, may fail to meet consumers\u2019 expectations, and may have a negative impact on our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our key personnel.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel, including our executive officers and senior management team. The unexpected loss of, or misconduct by, one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business. Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain personnel across all levels of our business. Competition for employees can be intense. We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain necessary personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. This risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives, as well as by market conditions.\n20\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to risks related to the global scope of our operations. \nWe operate on a global basis, with a substantial majority of our fiscal 2023 net sales and operating income generated outside the United States. We maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located inside and outside the United States that manufacture, warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world. Our global operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including: (i) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the relative costs of operating in different places, which can affect our results of operations, the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and competitors sell products in the same markets, the cost of certain inventory and non-inventory items required in our operations, and the relative prices at which we sell our products in different markets; (ii) foreign or U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including restrictions on trade, immigration and travel, operations, and investments; currency exchange controls; restrictions on imports and exports, including license requirements; tariffs; sanctions; and taxes; (iii) lack of well-established or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate; (iv) adverse weather conditions and natural disasters; (v) concentration of sales growth or profitability in one or more countries (e.g., China); and (vi) social, economic and geopolitical conditions, such as a pandemic, terrorist attack, war or other military action. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA disruption in our operations, including supply chain, could adversely affect our business.\nAs a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities. Such risks include industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, capacity constraints, disruptions in ingredient, material or packaging supply, as well as global shortages, disruptions in supply chain or information technology, loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites or suppliers, product quality control, safety, increase in commodity prices and energy costs, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters, outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and other events or external factors over which we have no control. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world. Some of our products rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers. Changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities, in compliance with applicable standards, and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business. In addition, any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations.\n As we outsource functions, we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions.\nAs part of our long-term strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner. In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers. These include certain information technology, supply chain, finance and human resource functions. The failure of one or more such providers to deliver the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, when we transition external service providers, we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nChanges in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies around the world.\u00a0Changes in these laws, regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof, that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results.\u00a0These changes include accounting standards, as well as laws and regulations relating to tax matters, trade (including sanctions), data privacy (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)), cybersecurity, anti-corruption, advertising, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, customs matters, product registration, ingredients, chemicals, packaging, selective distribution, and environmental or climate change matters.\n21\nTable of Contents\nDisputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are, and may in the future become, party to litigation, other disputes or regulatory proceedings across a wide range of matters, including ones relating to product liability matters (including asbestos-related claims), advertising, regulatory, employment, intellectual property, real estate, environmental, trade relations, tax and privacy. In general, claims made by us or against us in litigation, disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business.\u00a0It is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation, disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to, and the impact of certain of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business\n.\nGovernment reviews, inquiries, investigations and actions could harm our business.\nAs we operate in various locations around the world, our operations are subject to governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny.\u00a0The regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving, and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations.\u00a0From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities, as well as self-regulatory organizations, about our business and compliance with local laws, regulations or standards.\u00a0Any determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our employees, are not in compliance with existing laws, regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways, including the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, or similar results, all of which could potentially harm our business.\u00a0Regardless of the outcomes, these reviews, inquiries, investigations and actions could create negative publicity which could harm our business.\nRisks related to Technology and Cybersecurity Matters\nThe compromise or interruption of, or damage to, our information technology (including our operational technology and websites) by cybersecurity incidents, data security breaches, other security problems, design defects or system failures could have a material negative impact on our business.\nWe rely on information technology that supports our business processes, including research and development, product development, production, distribution, marketing, sales, order processing, consumer experiences, human resource management, finance and internal and external communications throughout the world. We have e-commerce, m-commerce and other Internet websites in the United States and many other countries. \nWe experience cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees on our information technology and, as a result, unauthorized parties have obtained in the past, and may obtain in the future, access to our systems and data (including unauthorized acquisition of such data). As we disclosed on July 18, 2023, and as noted in Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, an unauthorized third party gained access to some of our systems and data (including unauthorized acquisition of such data), which caused disruption to parts of our business operations and resulted in various expenses for investigation, remediation and other related matters.\nCybersecurity incidents at our Company have in the past resulted from, and may in the future result from, social engineering or impersonation of authorized users, and may also result from efforts to discover and exploit design flaws, bugs, security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses, intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges, intentional acts of vandalism or fraud by third parties and sabotage. In some instances, efforts to correct vulnerabilities or prevent incidents have in the past and may in the future reduce the functionality or performance of our information technology, which could negatively impact our business.  Cybersecurity incidents can be caused by ransomware, distributed denial-of-service attacks, worms, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, including the covert introduction of malware to our information technology, and the use of techniques or processes that change frequently, may be disguised or difficult to detect, or are designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, and may continue undetected for an extended period of time.  In addition, some of our suppliers, vendors, service providers, cloud solution providers and customers have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, such incidents, which could in turn disrupt our business.  Insurance policies that may provide coverage with regard to such events may not cover any or all of the resulting financial losses.\n22\nTable of Contents\nAs part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain information that is confidential, proprietary or otherwise sensitive, including personal information of consumers, customers, suppliers, service providers and employees. We share some of this information with certain third parties who assist us with business matters. Moreover, the success of our operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential, proprietary or otherwise sensitive data, including personal information, over networks. Any unauthorized access or data acquisition, despite security measures in place to protect such data, or other failure on the part of us or third parties to maintain the security of such data could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, legal obligations, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also could result in deterioration in confidence in our Company and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business. \nIn addition, a cybersecurity incident could require that we expend significant additional resources on remediation, restoration and enhancement of our information technology.\nRisks related to our Securities and our Ownership Structure\nThe trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our financial performance.\nOur business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter.\u00a0We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.\u00a0At the same time, however, we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our expectations regarding certain aspects of our business.\u00a0This could include forecasts of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections.\u00a0We assume no responsibility to provide or update guidance, and any longer-term guidance we may provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years.\u00a0We historically have paid dividends on our common stock and repurchased shares of our Class\u00a0A Common Stock; however, at times we have suspended the declaration of dividends and/or the repurchase of our Class A Common Stock. Going forward, at any time, we could stop, suspend or change the amounts of dividends or stop or suspend our stock repurchase program, and any such action could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nIn all of our public statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our business, whether it be about net sales or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives, or otherwise, we accompany such statements directly, or by reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect.\u00a0Such a list is included, among other places, in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC (e.g., in our reports on Form\u00a010-K and Form\u00a010-Q).\u00a0These and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our earnings or other financial metrics, or business outcomes, will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.\nOutside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our business for any future period.\u00a0Outside analysts, however, have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor, and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance.\u00a0Nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations.\u00a0If our actual results differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting, the market price of our securities could be affected.\u00a0Investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk.\u00a0We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.\nWe are controlled by the Lauder family.\u00a0As a result, the Lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by us.\nAs of August\u00a011, 2023, members of the Lauder family beneficially own, directly or indirectly, shares of the Company\u2019s Class\u00a0A Common Stock (with one vote per share) and Class\u00a0B Common Stock (with 10 votes per share) having approximately 84% of the outstanding voting power of the Common Stock.\u00a0In addition, there are four members of the Lauder family who are Company employees and members of our Board of Directors.\nAs a result of their stock ownership and positions at the Company, as well as our dual-class structure, the Lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business, including all matters requiring stockholder approval (e.g., the election of directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation, and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets) for the foreseeable future.\u00a0In addition, if significant stock indices decide to prohibit the inclusion of companies with dual-class stock structures, the price of our Class\u00a0A Common Stock could be negatively impacted and could become more volatile.\n23\nTable of Contents\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules\u00a0and, as a result, are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not \u201ccontrolled companies.\u201d\nThe Lauder family and their related entities own more than 50% of the total voting power of our common shares and, as a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards.\u00a0As a controlled company, we are exempt under the New York Stock Exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that (1)\u00a0a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors; (2)\u00a0we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and (3)\u00a0we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nWhile we have voluntarily caused our Board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our Nominating and ESG Committee and Compensation Committee to have the required provisions, we are not requiring our Nominating and ESG Committee and Compensation Committee to be comprised solely of independent directors.\u00a0As a result of our use of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemptions, investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements.",

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2013 Note 17 \u2013 Common Stock\n. \nPension and Post-retirement Plan Funding\nSeveral factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans.\u00a0For our domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (\u201cU.S. Qualified Plan\u201d), we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages.\u00a0For any future contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan, we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (\u201cERISA\u201d) and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.\u00a0For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations.\u00a0In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions\n.\n\u00a0The effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.\nFor the U.S. Qualified Plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities.\u00a0This strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio.\u00a0For fiscal 2023 and 2022, we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under ERISA regulations for the U.S. Qualified Plan.\u00a0We expect to make a $50 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. Qualified Plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. As we continue to monitor the funded status, we may decide to make additional cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan or our post-retirement medical plan in the United States during fiscal 2024.\nThe following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and post-retirement plans:\n\u00a0\nYear Ended June\u00a030\n(In millions)\nExpected 2024\n2023\n2022\nNon-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan benefit payments\n$\n22\u00a0\n$\n14\u00a0\n$\n18\u00a0\nInternational defined benefit pension plan contributions\n$\n28\u00a0\n$\n35\u00a0\n$\n38\u00a0\nPost-retirement plan benefit payments\n$\n11\u00a0\n$\n13\u00a0\n$\n11\u00a0\nCommitments and Contingencies\nFor a discussion of our contingencies, see to \nItem 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2013 Note 12 \u2013 Derivative Financial Instruments (Credit Risk)\n.\nMarket Risk\nWe address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.\u00a0To perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts, we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\u00a0A hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately $265 million and $259 million as of June\u00a030, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\u00a0This potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures.\nWe also enter into cross-currency swap contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency changes on certain intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. A hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our cross-currency swap contracts would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $49\u00a0million as of June 30, 2023.\nIn addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio, including future debt issuances. Based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by approximately $55 million and $41 million as of June\u00a030, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nOur sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.\u00a0It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.\u00a0We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nRefer to \nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2013 Note 2 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective, on our consolidated financial statements.\n52\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June\u00a030, 2023 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June\u00a030, 2023 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).\u00a0The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.\u00a0These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.\u00a0We consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i)\u00a0the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii)\u00a0the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the Company\u2019s financial condition.\u00a0Our critical accounting policies relate to Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets - Impairment Assessment, Income Taxes, and Asset Acquisition.\nManagement of the Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets \u2013 Impairment Assessment\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.\u00a0Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.\u00a0Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.\nWhen testing goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.\u00a0If necessary, we can perform a single step quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. \nFor fiscal 2023, we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for the goodwill in certain of our reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of its reporting units were below carrying value.\u00a0We considered macroeconomic factors including the global economic growth, general macroeconomic trends for the markets in which the reporting units operate and the intangible assets are employed, and the growth of the global prestige beauty industry.\u00a0In addition to these macroeconomic factors, among other things, we considered the reporting units\u2019 current results and forecasts, any changes in the nature of the business, any significant legal, regulatory, contractual, political or other business climate factors, changes in the industry/competitive environment, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets and its intention to sell or dispose of a reporting unit or cease the use of a trademark.\nFor fiscal 2023, a quantitative assessment was performed for the goodwill in certain of our reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. We engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management. To determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units, we used an equal weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we determined fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflected the relative risk of the cash flows. Under the market approach, we utilized market multiples from publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. The significant assumptions used in these two approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal value, the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples. To determine the estimated fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we used an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. The significant assumptions used in this approach include revenue growth rates, terminal value, the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rate. \n53\nTable of Contents\nFor fiscal 2022, we elected to perform the quantitative assessment for the goodwill in each of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

The significant assumptions used in this approach include revenue growth rates, terminal value, the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rate.\nFor further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets, see \nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2013 Note 2 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, \nNote 6 \u2013 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n.\nIncome Taxes\nWe calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate.\u00a0As the application of various tax laws relevant to our global business is often uncertain, significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.\u00a0The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, net operating losses, tax credit and other carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled.\u00a0We regularly review deferred tax assets for realizability and establish valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and appropriate tax planning strategies.\u00a0If our assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time, while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.\nWe provide tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit.\u00a0The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. We assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management\u2019s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.\u00a0For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.\u00a0For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\u00a0We classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.\u00a0Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.\u00a0If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings.\nFor further discussion of Income Taxes, see \nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2013 Note 2 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n and \nNote 9 \u2013 Income Taxes\n.\nAsset Acquisition\nWe recognize assets acquired in an asset acquisition based on the cost to the Company on a relative fair value basis, which includes transaction costs in addition to consideration transferred and liabilities assumed or issued as part of the transaction. Neither goodwill nor bargain purchase gains are recognized in an asset acquisition; any excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired, or the opposite, is allocated to qualifying assets based on their relative fair values. The determination of fair value, as well as the expected useful lives of certain assets acquired, requires management to make judgments and may involve the use of significant estimates, including assumptions with respect to estimated future cash flows and discount rates, among other things. Management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.\n54\nTable of Contents\nDuring fiscal 2023, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in 001 Del LLC (\u201c001\u201d) in exchange for $2,550 million in consideration (the \u201cTOM FORD Acquisition\u201d). The TOM FORD Acquisition has been accounted for as an asset acquisition as the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in the value of the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset. The acquisition of 001 included existing license relationships for certain uses of the brand name, which were modified, terminated or otherwise renegotiated in connection with the transaction.\nThe total cost of the asset acquisition is $2,578 million and was allocated to the TOM FORD trademark.  We engaged a third-party valuation specialist and used an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method, to determine the fair value of the TOM FORD trademark. This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value were revenue growth rates, terminal value, beauty royalty savings, the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates. \nFor further discussion of Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions, see \nItem 8.
