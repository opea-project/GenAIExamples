Health\nOur Animal Health business develops, manufactures and markets about 270 product lines, including:\n\u25cf\nantibacterials, which inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria that cause infections in animals; anticoccidials, which inhibit the growth of coccidia (parasites) that damage the intestinal tract of animals; and related products (MFAs and other);\n\u25cf\nnutritional specialty products, which support nutrition to help improve health and performance (nutritional specialties); and\n\u25cf\nvaccines, which induce an increase in antibody levels against a specific virus or bacterium, thus preventing disease due to infection with wild strains of that virus or bacterium (vaccines).\nOur animal health products help our customers prevent, control and treat diseases and support nutrition to help improve health and well-being, enabling our customers to more efficiently produce high-quality, wholesome and affordable animal protein products for human consumption. We develop, manufacture and market a broad range of animal health products for food animals including poultry, swine, beef and dairy cattle and aquaculture. We provide technical and product support directly to our customers to ensure the optimal use of our products. The animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by changing disease pressures and by weather conditions, as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and seasons. As a result, we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our animal health segment.\nWe continue to build our companion animal business and pipeline. Our Rejensa\n\u00ae\n joint supplement for dogs continues to gain customer acceptance. Our companion animal development pipeline includes an early-stage atopic dermatitis compound, a novel Lyme vaccine delivery system product, a potential treatment for mitral heart valve disease in dogs, a pain product and two early-stage oral care compounds. \nAnimal Health net sales by product group and regions were:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nProduct Groups\n\u200b\nChange\n\u200b\nPercentage\u00a0of\u00a0total\n\u00a0\nFor the Year Ended June\u00a030\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2023\u00a0/\u00a02022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\u00a0/\u00a02021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n($ in millions)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nMFAs and other\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 387\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 362\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 330\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 26\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n 7\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 32\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n 10\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 59\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 60\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 60\n%\nNutritional specialties\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 173\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 157\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 143\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 15\n\u00a0\n 10\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 14\n\u00a0\n 10\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 26\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 26\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 26\n%\nVaccines\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 100\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 88\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 73\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 12\n\u00a0\n 13\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 15\n\u00a0\n 21\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 15\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 15\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 13\n%\nAnimal Health\n\u200b\n$\n 660\n\u200b\n$\n 607\n\u200b\n$\n 546\n\u200b\n$\n 53\n\u00a0\n 9\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 61\n\u00a0\n 11\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nRegions\n(1)\n\u200b\nChange\n\u200b\nPercentage\u00a0of\u00a0total\n\u00a0\nFor the Year Ended June\u00a030\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2023\u00a0/\u00a02022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\u00a0/\u00a02021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n($ in millions)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nUnited States\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 277\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 248\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 227\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 29\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n 12\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 21\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n 9\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 42\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 41\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 42\n%\nLatin America and Canada\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 207\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 175\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 151\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 32\n\u200b\n 18\n%\n\u200b\n 24\n\u200b\n 16\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 31\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 29\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 28\n%\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 116\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 120\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 110\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (4)\n\u200b\n (3)\n%\n\u200b\n 10\n\u200b\n 9\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 18\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 20\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 20\n%\nAsia Pacific\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 60\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 64\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 58\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (4)\n\u00a0\n (6)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 6\n\u00a0\n 10\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 9\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 11\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n 11\n%\nTotal\n\u200b\n$\n 660\n\u200b\n$\n 607\n\u200b\n$\n 546\n\u200b\n$\n 53\n\u00a0\n 9\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 61\n\u00a0\n 11\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n(1)\nNet sales by region are based on country of destination.\nCertain amounts and\u00a0percentages may reflect rounding adjustments.\n8\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMFAs and Other\nOur MFAs and other products primarily consist of concentrated medicated products administered through animal feeds, commonly referred to as Medicated Feed Additives (\u201cMFAs\u201d).

We market our nutritional specialty products in all regions in which we operate.\nVaccines\nOur vaccine products are primarily focused on preventing diseases in poultry, swine, beef and dairy cattle and aquaculture. We market our vaccine products to protect animals from either viral or bacterial disease challenges in all regions in which we operate.\nWe have developed and market approximately 345 licensed vaccine presentations for the prevention of diseases in poultry, including vaccines to protect against Infectious Bursal Disease, Infectious Bronchitis, Newcastle Disease, Reovirus, Salmonella and Coryza.\nWe develop, manufacture and market autogenous vaccines against animal diseases for swine, poultry and beef and dairy cattle in the United States and Brazil. Our autogenous bacterial and viral vaccines enable us to produce custom vaccines for veterinarians that contain antigens specific to each farm, allowing Phibro to provide comprehensive and customized health management solutions to our customers. Our autogenous vaccine products include the Tailor-Made\n\u00ae\n and Phi-Shield\n\u00ae\n lines of vaccines and the MJPRRS\n\u00ae \nvaccine. We also develop, manufacture and market adjuvants to animal vaccine manufacturers globally.\nWe have developed TAbic\n\u00ae\n, an innovative and proprietary delivery platform for vaccines. TAbic is a patented technology for formulation and delivery of vaccine antigens in effervescent tablets, packaged in sealed aluminum blister packages. The technology replaces the glass bottles that are in common use today, and offers significant sustainability advantages including reduced storage requirements, customer handling and disposal. Several of our vaccine products are available in the patented TAbic format.\nWe also focus on innovation to produce new antigens or new presentations of antigens, and have developed new vaccines and related technologies, such as:\n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nMB-1\n\u00ae\n, a live attenuated vaccine for Infectious Bursal disease, developed from the M.B. strain, adapted for in-ovo or subcutaneous injection at the hatchery;\n\u25cf\nTAbic\n\u00ae\n IB VAR206, a live attenuated virus vaccine for Infectious Bronchitis developed from a unique genotype 2 variant strain;\n\u25cf\nThe inactivated subunit Infectious Bursal Disease Virus;\n\u25cf\nSalmin Plus\n\u00ae\n, the first multi-variant inactivated vaccine containing Salmonella Enteritis, Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Infantis;\n\u25cf\nEASE\n\u00ae\n (Enhanced Antigen Surface Expression), a new bacterial growth procedure to improve the performance of our vaccines; and\n\u25cf\npHi-Tech\n\u00ae\n, a portable electronic vaccination device and software that ensures proper delivery of vaccines and provides health management information.\nWe continue to invest in a vaccine production facility in Sligo, Ireland to manufacture poultry vaccines, with our first commercial sale of product from this facility having occurred in fiscal year 2022, and longer-term expectations to add swine and cattle vaccines production at this facility. Installation of additional machinery and equipment is planned while we continue to submit necessary registrations on a country-by-country basis in order to obtain regulatory approvals needed to sell these products to a broader geographic market.\n\u200b\nWe recently completed construction of and received regulatory approval for a new vaccine production facility in Guarulhos, Brazil to manufacture and market autogenous vaccines that combat disease in swine, poultry and aquaculture.\n\u200b\nMineral Nutrition\nOur Mineral Nutrition business manufactures and markets approximately 420 formulations and concentrations of trace minerals such as zinc, manganese, copper, iron and other compounds, with a focus on customers in North America. Our customers use these products to fortify the daily feed requirements of their animals\u2019 diets and maintain an optimal balance of trace elements in each animal. We manufacture and market a broad range of mineral nutrition products for food animals including poultry, swine and beef and dairy cattle. Volume growth in the mineral nutrition sector is primarily driven by livestock production and customer inventory levels, while pricing is largely based on costs of the underlying commodity metals. Demand for our mineral nutrition products can vary due to changes in customer buying patterns, seasonal variability and weather conditions in a particular region, which may cause animal feed consumption to fluctuate. \nPerformance Products\nOur Performance Products business manufactures and markets specialty ingredients for use in the personal care, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries, predominantly in the United States.\nOur Products\nAnimal Health\nMFAs and Other\nOur MFAs and other products primarily consist of the production and sale of antibacterials (Stafac, Terramycin, Neo-Terramycin and Mecadox) and anticoccidials (Nicarb, Aviax, Aviax Plus, Coxistac and amprolium).

These organic trace minerals are available in a highly concentrated, easy-flowing granule.\nOur mineral nutrition products also include the Vistore\n\u00ae\n portfolio of products, our chloride mineral option of value-driven trace mineral offerings. Our formulas feature high metal content to ensure optimal mineral presence and preserve critical ration space. High bioavailability also promotes maximized absorption for enhanced results and minimized waste.\nOur major mineral nutrition customers are U.S. regional and national feed companies, distributors, co-ops, pre-mixers, integrated swine, beef and poultry producers and pet food manufacturers. The majority of our customers have nutrition staffs who determine their specific formulas for custom trace mineral premixes. Trace mineral costs and our selling prices fluctuate with commodity markets, and therefore, these products are price sensitive. Their sale requires a focused effort on cost and inventory management, quality control, customer service, pricing and logistics execution to be profitable.\nPerformance Products\nOur Performance Products business manufactures and markets specialty ingredients for use in the personal care, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. We operate the business through our PhibroChem (a division of PAHC), Ferro Metal and Chemical Corporation Limited and Phibro-Tech, Inc. (\u201cPhibro-Tech\u201d) business\u00a0units.\n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales organization includes sales, marketing and technical support employees. In markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence, we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products. Together, our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition businesses have a sales, marketing and technical support organization of more than 400 employees and approximately 195 distributors who market our portfolio of approximately 690 product lines to livestock producers, veterinarians, nutritionists, animal feed companies and distributors in over 80 countries.\nIn markets where we have a direct commercial presence, we sell our animal health and mineral nutrition products through our local sales offices, either directly to integrated poultry, swine and beef and dairy cattle producers or through commercial animal feed manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors. Our sales representatives visit our customers, including livestock producers, veterinarians, nutritionists, animal feed companies and distributors, to inform, promote and sell our products and services. In direct service markets, our technical operations specialists provide scientific consulting focused on disease management and herd management, and training and education on diverse topics, including responsible product use.\nWe sell our Performance Products through our local sales offices to the personal care, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. We market these products predominately in the United States.\nCustomers\nWe have approximately 4,000 customers, of which approximately 3,800 customers are served by our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition businesses. We consider a diverse set of livestock producers, including poultry and swine operations and beef and dairy cattle farmers, to be the primary customers of our livestock products. We sell our animal health and mineral nutrition products directly to livestock and aquaculture producers and to distributors that typically re-sell the products to livestock producers. We sell our companion animal product using a distributor calling on veterinary clinics.  We do not consider the business to be dependent on a single customer or a few customers, and we believe the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results.\nWe typically sell pursuant to purchase orders from customers and generally do not enter into long-term delivery contracts.\nProduct Registrations, Patents and Trademarks\nWe own certain product registrations, patents, trade names and trademarks, and use know-how, trade secrets, formulae and manufacturing techniques, which assist in maintaining the competitive positions of certain of our products. We believe that technology is an important component of our competitive position, and it provides us with low-cost positions enabling us to produce high quality products. Patents protect some of our technology, but a significant portion of our competitive advantage is based on know-how built up over many\u00a0years of commercial operation, which is protected as trade secrets. We own, or have exclusive rights to use under license, approximately 282 patents or pending applications in more than 30 countries but we believe that no single patent is of material importance to our business and, accordingly, that the expiration or termination thereof would not materially affect our business.\nWe market our animal health products under hundreds of governmental product registrations approving many of our products with respect to animal drug safety and efficacy. The use of many of our medicated products is regulated by authorities that are specific to each country, e.g., the FDA in the United States, Health Canada in Canada and European Food Safety Authority (\u201cEFSA\u201d) and the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d) in Europe. Medicated product registrations and requirements are country- and product-specific for each country in which they are sold. We continuously monitor, maintain and update the appropriate registration files pertaining to such regulations and approvals. In certain countries where we work with a third-party distributor, local regulatory requirements may require registration in the name of such distributor. As of June\u00a030,\u00a02023, we had approximately 1,055 Animal Health product registrations globally, including approximately 390 MFA registrations, 345 vaccine registrations (including autogenous vaccines) and 320 registrations for nutritional specialty products. Our MFA global registrations included approximately 90 registrations for virginiamycin.\nAdditionally, many of our vaccine products are based on proprietary master seeds, proprietary adjuvant formulations or patented virus grouping technology. We actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade \n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\nsecrets and proprietary know-how, by seeking to require our employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement.\nWe seek to file and maintain trademark registrations around the world based on commercial activities in most regions where we have, or desire to have, a business presence for a particular product or service. We currently maintain, or have rights to use under license, approximately 3,700 trademark registrations or pending applications globally, identifying goods and services related to our business.\nOur technology, brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. Our policy is to vigorously protect, enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property, as appropriate.\nCompliance with Government Regulation\nMany of our animal health and mineral nutrition products require licensing by a governmental agency before marketing. To maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements, we have established processes, systems and dedicated resources with end-to-end involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market. Our regulatory function seeks to engage in dialogue with various global agencies regarding their policies that relate to animal health products. For products that are currently subject to formal licensing by government agencies, our business relies on the ongoing approval and/or periodic re-approval of those licenses. Failure to maintain and, where applicable, renew those licenses for any reason including, but not limited to, changing regulations, more stringent technical, legal or regulatory requirements, or failure of the company or its agents to make timely, complete or accurate submissions, could result in suspension or loss of the company\u2019s rights to market its products in one or more countries.\nUnited States\nIn the United States, governmental oversight of animal nutrition and health products is conducted primarily by the FDA and/or the United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d). The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) has jurisdiction over certain products applied topically to animals or to premises to control external parasites and shares regulatory jurisdiction of ethanol manufactured in biofuel manufacturing facilities with the FDA.\nThe FDA regulates foods intended for human consumption and, through the Center for Veterinary Medicine (\u201cCVM\u201d), regulates the manufacture and distribution of animal drugs marketed in the U.S. including those administered to animals from which human foods are derived. All manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals marketed in the United States, must show their products to be safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. To protect the food and drug supply, the FDA develops technical standards for human and animal drug safety, effectiveness, labeling and Good Manufacturing Practice. The CVM evaluates data necessary to support approvals of veterinary drugs. Drug sponsors are required to file reports of certain product quality defects and adverse events in accordance with agency requirements.\nFDA approval of Type A/B/C Medicated Feed Articles and drugs is based on satisfactory demonstration of safety, efficacy, manufacturing quality standards and appropriate labeling. Efficacy requirements are based on the desired label claim and encompass all species for which label indication is desired. Safety requirements include target animal safety and, in the case of food animals, human food safety (\u201cHFS\u201d). HFS reviews include drug residue levels and the safety of those residue levels. In addition to the safety and efficacy requirements for animal drugs used in food-producing animals, environmental safety must be demonstrated. Depending on the compound, the environmental studies may be quite extensive and expensive. In many instances, the regulatory hurdles for a drug that will be used in food-producing animals are at least as stringent as, if not more so than, those required for a drug used in humans. In addition, certain safety requirements relating to antimicrobial resistance must be met for antimicrobial products.\nThe CVM Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation is responsible for reviewing information submitted by drug sponsors who wish to obtain approval to manufacture and sell animal drugs. A new animal drug is deemed unsafe unless there is an approved New Animal Drug Application (\u201cNADA\u201d). Virtually all animal drugs are \u201cnew animal drugs\u201d within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. An approved Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (\u201cANADA\u201d) is a generic equivalent of an NADA previously approved by the FDA. Both are regulated by the FDA. The drug development process for human therapeutics is generally more involved than that for animal drugs. However, because human food safety and environmental safety are issues for food-producing animals, the animal drug approval process for food-producing animals typically takes longer than for companion animals.\n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe FDA may deny an NADA or ANADA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. There can be no assurances that FDA approval of any NADA or ANADA will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed. Finally, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing. Among the conditions for NADA or ANADA approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer\u2019s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) regulations. A manufacturing facility is periodically inspected by the FDA for determination of compliance with cGMP after an initial pre-approval inspection. Certain subsequent manufacturing changes must be approved by the FDA prior to implementation. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, monies and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure compliance. The process of seeking FDA approvals can be costly, time consuming and subject to unanticipated and significant delays. There can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. Any delay in obtaining or any failure to obtain FDA or foreign government approvals, or the suspension or revocation of such approvals, would adversely affect our ability to introduce and market our products and to generate revenue.\nThe issue of the potential for increased bacterial resistance to certain antibiotics used in certain food-producing animals is the subject of discussions on a worldwide basis and, in certain instances, has led to government restrictions on the use of antibiotics in these food-producing animals. The sale of antibiotics is a material portion of our business. Legislative bills are introduced in the United States Congress from time to time that, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on our business. One of these initiatives is a proposed bill called the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which has been introduced in almost every Congress since the mid 2000\u2019s. To date, such bills have not had sufficient support to become law. Should statutory, regulatory or other developments result in restrictions on the sale of our products, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe USDA regulates the U.S. veterinary vaccines through the Center for Veterinary Biologics (\u201cCVB\u201d), which implements the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act to assure that pure, safe, potent and effective veterinary biologics are available for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of animal diseases. The CVB monitors and inspects vaccine products and the manufacturing facilities.\nThe EPA has established and monitors the Renewable Fuel Standard program, for which some of our biofuel manufacturing facilities must comply. Compliance includes generating and tracking renewable identification numbers documentation over transfer, blending and exporting, and quarterly reporting.\nVirginiamycin.\n In November\u00a02004, the CVM released a draft for comment of its risk assessment of streptogramin resistance for treatment of certain infections in humans attributable to the use of streptogramins in animals (the \u201crisk assessment\u201d). The risk assessment was initiated after approval of a human drug called Synercid\n\u00ae\n \n(quinupristin/dalfopristin) for treating vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (\u201cVREf\u201d), which led to increased attention regarding the use of streptogramins in animals. Synercid and virginiamycin (the active ingredient in our Stafac product) are both members of the streptogramin class of antimicrobial drugs. The risk assessment was unable to produce any firm conclusions as to whether, and, if so, how much, the use of virginiamycin in food animals contributes to the occurrence of streptogramin-resistant infections in humans via a foodborne pathway.\nIn classifying streptogramins in 2003 as a \u201cmedically important antimicrobial\u201d (\u201cMIA\u201d) on the CVM\u2019s Guidance for Industry (\u201cGFI\u201d) 152 list, a guidance document for evaluating the microbial safety of antimicrobial new animal drugs on food for human consumption, the FDA\u2019s stated concern was the potential impact on use of Synercid for treating VREf in humans. In 2010, the U.S. label for Synercid was changed and the VREf indication was removed. The FDA determined that data submitted by the sponsor of Synercid failed to verify clinical benefit of the product for the treatment of VREf infections in humans. We requested that the FDA remove the streptogramin class of antimicrobials from GFI 152 to reflect that they are not \u201cmedically important\u201d for human therapy, however, the FDA declined our request. The FDA has recently issued a draft of GFI 152 and the streptogram class of antimicrobials was still included as medically important. Phibro submitted comments again to the open docket recommending that streptogramins be listed as not medically important, particularly in light of the recent withdrawal of Synercid from the U.S. market by the sponsor. There is no certainty surrounding the outcome of the current review of the GFI 152 list and actions that may be taken by the FDA.\n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMIAs.\n Effective January\u00a02017, the CVM\u2019s revised Veterinary Feed Directive (\u201cVFD\u201d) regulations, which included changes to the control and use of antimicrobial products for use in animal feed, require that affected antimicrobial products may only be used if authorized by a veterinarian in accordance with the regulations. Prior to implementation of the revised VFD regulations, many approved antimicrobial products could be obtained and used without formal veterinary authorization.\nIn January\u00a02017, the FDA and industry, including us, completed the process of label changes for MIA products to remove production claims and to limit the use of MIAs to those uses that are considered necessary for assuring animal health, namely for the prevention, control and/or treatment of disease, and that MIA use in food-producing animals should include veterinary oversight or consultation. The label changes were the result of recommendations from the CVM, as described in GFI 213 (\u201cNew Animal Drugs and New Animal Drug Combination Products Administered in or on Medicated Feed or Drinking Water of Food-Producing Animals: Recommendations for Drug Sponsors for Voluntarily Aligning Product Use Conditions with GFI 209\u201d) and GFI 209 (\u201cThe Judicious Use of Medically Important Antimicrobial Drugs in Food-Producing Animals\u201d).\nCarbadox.\n In April 2016, the FDA began initial steps to withdraw approval of carbadox (the active ingredient in our Mecadox product) via a regulatory process known as a Notice of Opportunity for Hearing (\u201cNOOH\u201d), due to concerns that certain residues from the product may persist in animal tissues for longer than previously determined. Carbadox has been approved and sold in the United States for 50 years and is a widely used treatment for controlling bacterial diseases in swine, including Salmonella and swine dysentery. In the years following, Phibro has continued an ongoing process of responding collaboratively and transparently to the FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine (\u201cCVM\u201d) inquiries and has provided extensive and meticulous research and data that confirmed the safety of carbadox. In July 2020, the FDA announced it would not proceed to a hearing on the scientific concerns raised in the 2016 NOOH, consistent with the normal regulatory procedure, but instead announced that it was withdrawing the 2016 NOOH and issuing a proposed order to review the regulatory method for carbadox. Phibro reiterated the safety of carbadox and the appropriateness of the regulatory method and offered to work with the CVM to generate additional data to support the existing regulatory method or select a suitable alternative regulatory method. \nIn March 2022, the FDA held a Part 15 virtual public hearing seeking data and information related to the safety of carbadox in which Phibro participated and again detailed the extensive research and data that confirm the safety of carbadox. In the event the FDA continues to assert that carbadox should be removed from the market, we will argue that we are entitled to and expect to have a full evidentiary hearing on the merits before an administrative law judge. Should we be unable to successfully defend the safety of the product, the loss of carbadox sales will have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Sales of Mecadox (carbadox) for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023 were approximately $20 million. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Mecadox continues to be available for use by swine producers.\nManufacturing.\n The FDA routinely carries out audits related to cGMP standards for manufacturing facilities that make veterinary drug products and active pharmaceutical ingredients approved for sale in the U.S. The FDA inspectors may make observations during these inspections, which may require corrective action in order for the manufacturing facility to remain in compliance with cGMP standards. Failure to take such corrective actions could result in the manufacturing facility being ineligible to receive future FDA approvals. In very serious cases of noncompliance with cGMP standards, the FDA may issue a warning letter which could result in products produced in such manufacturing facilities to be ineligible for sale in the U.S. Although it is our objective to remain in full conformance with U.S. cGMP standards, we have in the past received adverse observations and may in the future receive adverse observations or warning letters. Failure to comply with cGMP standards could have a material impact on our business and financial results.\nEuropean Union\nEuropean Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) legislation requires that veterinary medicinal products must have a marketing authorization before they are placed on the market in the European Union. A veterinary medicinal product must meet certain quality, safety, efficacy and environmental criteria to receive a marketing authorization. The European Medicines Agency (and its main veterinary scientific committee, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use) and the national authorities in the various E.U. Member States, are responsible for administering this regime.\n18\n\n\nTable of Contents\nA separate E.U. regime applies to feed additives. It provides for a re-registration process for existing additives and this process is ongoing. For certain types of additives, the authorizations are not generic in nature (so that they can be relied upon by any operator) but are limited to the company that obtained the marketing authorization. They are known as Brand Specific Approvals (\u201cBSA\u201d). The system is similar to the U.S. system, where regulatory approval is for the formulated product or \u201cbrand.\u201d\nThe EFSA is responsible for the E.U. risk assessment regarding food and feed safety. Operating under the European Commission, in close collaboration with national authorities and in open consultation with its stakeholders, the EFSA provides independent scientific advice and communication on existing and emerging risks. The EFSA may issue advice regarding the process of adopting or revising European legislation on food or feed safety, deciding whether to approve regulated substances such as pesticides and food additives, or developing new regulatory frameworks and policies, for instance, in the field of nutrition. The EFSA aims to provide appropriate, consistent, accurate and timely communications on food safety issues to all stakeholders and the public at large, based on the Authority\u2019s risk assessments and scientific expertise. The containment of antimicrobial resistance is one of the key areas of concern for the EFSA, EMA, the European Commission and its Directorates, the European Parliament and European Member State Governments.\nA number of manufacturers, including us, submitted dossiers in order to re-register various anticoccidials for the purpose of obtaining regulatory approval from the European Commission. The BSA for our nicarbazin product was published in October 2010. Our reauthorization submission was made on time and is pending. We sell nicarbazin under our own BSA and as an active ingredient for another marketer\u2019s product that has obtained a BSA and is sold in the European Union. Similarly, a BSA for our semduramicin product, Aviax, was published in 2006 and our reauthorization submission was made on time and is pending. We have submitted a dossier for reauthorization in accordance with the requirements of the EFSA and responded to requests for additional information from the EFSA by submitting additional data for each product. The current BSAs remain valid while the EFSA reviews the additional data we have submitted. There can be no guarantee that these submissions will be reviewed favorably or in a timely manner. Failure to gain reauthorization in a timely manner could have an adverse financial impact on our business.\nThe Delegating and Implementing Acts under E.U. Regulation\u00a02019/6 includes provisions that could require animals or animal origin products imported into the E.U. from other countries to be produced under the same conditions as are required in the E.U. This may preclude the use of veterinary products not approved in the E.U. or require animal health products to be used in the manner approved in the E.U. If such restrictions are implemented, they could result in a reduction or elimination of the use of our products, especially our antibacterial products, in countries that export animals or animal origin products to the E.U. and other countries that align their regulations with E.U. regulations.\nBrazil\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Production and Supply (\u201cMAPA\u201d) is the regulatory body in Brazil responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medicinal feed additives for animal use. MAPA\u2019s regulatory activities are conducted through the Secretary of Agricultural Defense and its Livestock Products Inspection Department. These activities include the inspection and licensing of both manufacturing and commercial establishments for veterinary products, as well as the submission, review and approval of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medicinal feed additives.\nOther Countries\nWe are subject to regulatory requirements governing investigation, clinical trials and marketing approval for animal drugs in many other countries in which our products are sold. The regulatory approval process includes similar risks to those associated with the FDA and European Commission approvals set forth above.\nGlobal Policy and Guidance\nCountry-specific regulatory laws have provisions that include requirements for certain labeling, safety, efficacy and manufacturers\u2019 quality procedures (to assure the consistency of the products), as well as company records and reports. With the exception of Australia, Canada, Japan and New Zealand, most other countries\u2019 regulatory agencies will generally refer to the FDA, USDA, European Union and other international animal health entities, including the World \n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOrganization for Animal Health, Codex Alimentarius Commission, the recognized international standard-setting body for food (\u201cCodex\u201d), before establishing their own standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines.\nThe Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives is an international expert scientific committee that is administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization. It provides risk assessments and safety evaluations of residues of veterinary drugs in animal products as well as exposure and residue definition and maximum residue limit proposals for veterinary drugs in traded food commodities. These internationally published references may also be used by national authorities when setting domestic standards. We work with the national authorities to establish acceptable safe levels of residual product in food-producing animals after treatment. This in turn enables the calculation of appropriate withdrawal times for our products prior to an animal entering the food chain.\nIn July\u00a02014, the Codex adopted risk management advice language for a number of compounds including carbadox. The advice language states \u201cauthorities should prevent residues of carbadox in food. This can be accomplished by not using carbadox in food producing animals.\u201d The advice language is to provide advice only and is not binding on individual national authorities, and almost all national authorities already have long-established regulatory standards for carbadox, including prohibiting the use of carbadox in swine production within their territory, prohibiting the importation of pork from swine that are fed carbadox, or permitting the importation of pork from swine that are fed carbadox provided there is no detection of carbadox residues in the meat. The advice language may be considered by national authorities in making future risk management determinations. To the extent additional national authorities elect to follow the advice and prohibit the use of carbadox in food-producing animals and/or the importation of pork from swine that are fed carbadox, such decisions could have an adverse effect on our sales of carbadox in those countries or in countries that produce meat for export to those countries.\nAdvertising and Promotion Review\nPromotion of animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those approved claims and uses that have been reviewed and endorsed by the applicable agency. We conduct a review of promotion material for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell animal health products.\nFood Safety Inspection Service/Generally Recognized As Safe\nThe FDA is authorized to determine the safety of substances (including \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d or \u201cGRAS\u201d substances, and food and feed additives), as well as prescribing safe conditions of use. The FDA, which has the responsibility for determining the safety of substances, together with the Food Safety and Inspection Service, the food safety branch within the USDA, maintain the authority in the United States to determine that new substances and new uses of previously approved substances are suitable for use in meat, milk and poultry products.\nCompetition\nWe are engaged in highly competitive industries and, with respect to all our major products, face competition from a substantial and continually evolving number of global and regional competitors. Some competitors have greater financial, R&D, manufacturing and other resources than we have. Our competitive position is based principally on our product registrations, customer service and support, breadth of product line, product quality, manufacturing technology, facility locations and product prices. We face competition in every market in which we participate. Many of our products face competition from products that may be used as an alternative or substitute.\nThere has been, and there may continue to be, consolidation in the animal health market, which could strengthen our competitors. Our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to maintain our current competitive position, however, we believe the following strengths create sustainable competitive advantages that will enable us to continue our growth as a leader in our industry.\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\nProducts Aligned with Need for Increased Protein Production\nIncreased scarcity of natural resources is increasing the need for efficient production of food animals such as poultry, swine and cattle. Our animal health products, including our MFAs, vaccines and nutritional specialty products, help prevent and manage disease outbreaks and enhance nutrition to help support natural defenses against diseases. These products are often critical to our customers\u2019 efficient production of healthy animals. Our leading MFAs product franchise, Stafac/V-Max/Eskalin, is approved in over 30 countries for use in poultry, swine and beef and dairy cattle and is regarded as one of the leading MFA products for production animals. Our nicarbazin and amprolium MFAs are globally recognized anticoccidials. Our nutritional specialty product offerings such as OmniGen-AF and Animate are used increasingly in the global dairy industry, and Magni-Phi and Provia Prime/MicroLife Prime are rapidly becoming important products for poultry producers. Our vaccine products are effective against critical diseases in poultry, swine and beef and dairy cattle.\nGlobal Presence with Existing Infrastructure in Key High-Growth Markets\nWe have an established direct presence in many important emerging markets, and we believe we are a leader in many of the emerging markets in which we operate. Our existing operations and established sales, marketing and distribution network in over 80 countries provide us with opportunities to take advantage of global growth opportunities. Outside of the United States, our global footprint reaches to key high growth regions (countries where the livestock production growth rate is expected to be higher than the average growth rate) including Brazil and other countries in South America, China, India and Southeast Asia, Mexico, Turkey, Australia, Canada, Poland and other Eastern European countries and South Africa and other countries in Africa. Our operations in countries outside of the United States contributed approximately 58% of our Animal Health segment revenues for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023.\nLeading Positions in High Growth Sub-sectors of the Animal Health Market\nWe are a global leader in the development, manufacture and commercialization of MFAs and nutritional specialty products for the animal health market. We believe we are well positioned in the fastest growing food animal species segments of the animal health market with significant presence in poultry and swine. We believe our sales of MFA products were third largest in the animal health market.\nDiversified and Complementary Product Portfolio with Strong Brand Name Recognition\nWe market products across the three largest livestock species (poultry, swine, and beef and dairy cattle) and aquaculture and in the major product categories (MFAs, vaccines and nutritional specialty products). We believe our diversity of species and product categories enhances our sales mix and lowers our sales concentration risk. The complementary nature of our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition portfolio provides us with unique cross-selling opportunities that can be used to gain access to new customers or deepen our relationships with existing customers. We believe we have strong brand name recognition for the Phibro name and for many of our animal health and mineral nutrition products, and we believe Phibro vaccines are recognized as an industry standard in efficacy against highly virulent disease challenges. Our diverse portfolio of products also allows us to address the distinct growing conditions of livestock in different regions.\nExperienced Sales Force and Technical Support Staff with Strong, Consultative Customer Relationships\nWithin our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition segments, utilizing both our sales, marketing and technical support organization of approximately 400 employees and a broad distribution network, we market our portfolio of more than 690 product lines to livestock producers and veterinarians in over 80 countries. We interact with customers at both their corporate and operating level, which we believe allows us to develop an in-depth understanding of their needs. Our technical support and research personnel are also important contributors to our overall sales effort. We have a total of approximately 120 technical, field service and quality control/quality assurance personnel throughout the world. These professionals interface directly with our key customers to provide practical solutions to derive optimum benefits from our products.\n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\nExperienced, Committed Employees and Management Team\nWe have a diverse and highly skilled team of animal health professionals, including technical and field service personnel located in key countries throughout the world. These individuals have extensive field experience and are vital to helping us maintain and grow our business. Many of our field team have more than 20\u00a0years of experience in the animal health industry and many have been with us for more than 10\u00a0years.\nWe have a strong management team with a proven track record of success at both the corporate and operating levels. The executive management team has diverse backgrounds and on average more than 30 years of experience the animal health or related industry.\nHuman Capital\nAs of June\u00a030,\u00a02023, we had 1,920 employees in 52 locations spanning 33 countries. Certain of our Brazilian employees are covered by multi-employer regional industry-specific unions. Certain of our Israeli employees are covered by site-specific collective bargaining agreements. Certain employees globally are covered by individual employment agreements. \nWe strive to nurture a strong culture that empowers team members and provides opportunities for growth and development. The Denison Organization Culture survey was administered to all employees globally in 2021 and 2017, with at least a 75 percent response rate each time. Phibro employee engagement and commitment scores remained consistent at 82 percent favorable for engagement and 76 percent favorable for commitment. We are intently focused on maintaining these results across the organization.\nAt Phibro we view the strength of our team as a critical component of our success. The following principles, which guide our decisions and actions, provide an overview of how we approach management of human capital resources.\nOur Most Valuable Asset \u2013 The Company and its Employees\nWe recognize that our employees provide the competitive edge needed to compete successfully in world markets.  We adhere to human resources policies and practices that meet the needs of the business and the individual, so that we can attract and retain the highest caliber employees. Talent development is a strategic priority at Phibro, and we offer opportunities for growth at all levels of the company. Our goal is to ensure we have the right colleagues with the right skills in the right roles and with the appropriate support to build leadership capabilities and drive organizational results. As business priorities evolve and we seek to innovate, we work to nurture and develop current talent to best serve future needs. We take a programmatic and focused approach to developing our people. \nAchievement of business objectives and the fulfillment of individual career aspirations are reinforced by our competitive compensation and benefit programs, comprehensive training and development programs, health and safety programs that promote and safeguard employees\u2019 well-being, and work environments that are conducive to the successful application of skills and knowledge. In addition to traditional professional development, we offer a robust, cloud-based online training curriculum from one of the leading providers of development material for learning-focused organizations. \nEmployee safety is paramount. We have implemented our Road to Zero initiative, which utilizes teaming concepts to elevate employee involvement in project-based improvement activities. Participation drives a strong culture of safety and quality. Road to Zero provides a formal system for engagement, shared responsibility, leadership opportunities, meaningful contributions and accountability. We have and will continue to take the necessary daily precautions as recommended by local government authorities to keep our employees safe.\nStrength Through Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)\nWe create a positive and supportive work environment for our employees. Our approach enables opportunity for inclusion and encourages diverse perspectives and thinking to maximize the achievement of innovative and successful outcomes. We aim to protect employees from being discriminated against because of gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, race, religion, political beliefs, ethnic background, country of origin, language or non-job-related disabilities, and we follow these same principles when recruiting new talent to our organization. We offered training \n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncourses to our employees during fiscal year 2023 covering Diversity, Equity & Inclusion as well as Sensitivity and Unconscious Bias. \nRespecting Employees  \nPhibro employees are our greatest strength and most valuable asset. When we equip team members to apply their skills, talent and passions to contribute and make a positive impact, everyone succeeds. When we thrive as individuals and teams, the Company thrives. We promote from within wherever possible, safeguard the confidentiality of employee records and keep employees informed of issues affecting them.\nCultivating One Leader at a Time \nOur proprietary Leadership Model is a framework that guides how our people plan and act to advance company priorities. We strive for each executive/manager/employee to be consistently challenged to:\n\u25cf\nSee what needs to be done (strategy, vision, growth);\n\u25cf\nGet it done (execution); and\n\u25cf\nGet it done the right way (how you do it).\nRecognizing that leadership may be exhibited differently by an individual contributor versus a first-line manager versus an upper-level manager, all Phibro employees are consistently expected to demonstrate leadership behaviors.\nManufacturing\nThe Animal Health business segment manufactures many products internally and supplements that production with contract manufacturing organizations (\u201cCMOs\u201d) as necessary.\nWe manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for certain of our antibacterial and anticoccidial products in Guarulhos, Brazil and Braganca Paulista, Brazil. We manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for certain of our anticoccidial and antimicrobial products in Neot Hovav, Israel. We produce vaccines in Beit Shemesh, Israel, Sligo, Ireland, Omaha, Nebraska, and Guarulhos, Brazil. We produce adjuvants in Omaha, Nebraska. We produce pharmaceuticals, disinfectants and other animal health products in Petach Tikva, Israel. We produce certain of our nutritional specialty products in Quincy and Chillicothe, Illinois and Sarasota, Florida. We produce certain of our mineral nutrition products in Quincy, Illinois and Omaha, Nebraska.\nWe supplement internal manufacturing and production capabilities with CMOs. We purchase certain active pharmaceutical ingredients for other medicated products from CMOs in China, India and other locations. We then formulate the final dosage form in our facilities and in contract facilities located in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa and the United States.\nWe purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of third-party suppliers. Such raw materials are generally available from multiple sources, are purchased worldwide and are normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of the Company\u2019s business.\nWe believe that our existing facilities, as supplemented by CMOs, are adequate for our current requirements and for our operations in the foreseeable future.\nResearch and Development\nMost of our manufacturing facilities have chemists and technicians on staff involved in product development, quality assurance, quality control and providing technical services to customers. Research, development and technical service efforts are conducted by our veterinarians (DVMs) and nutritionists at various facilities.\nWe operate Animal Health R&D and product testing at several of our domestic and international facilities. We also engage various independent contract research organizations to undertake research and development activities.\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThese facilities provide R&D services relating to: fermentation development and micro-biological strain improvement; vaccine development; chemical synthesis and formulation development; nutritional specialty product development; and ethanol-related products.\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety\nOur operations and properties are subject to Environmental Laws (as defined below) and regulations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to attain and maintain compliance with Environmental Laws. While we believe that our operations are currently in material compliance with Environmental Laws, we have, from time to time, received notices of violation from governmental authorities, and have been involved in civil or criminal action for such violations. Additionally, at various sites, our subsidiaries are engaged in continuing investigation, remediation and/or monitoring to address contamination associated with historical operations. We maintain accruals for costs and liabilities associated with Environmental Laws, which we currently believe are adequate. In many instances, it is difficult to predict the ultimate costs under Environmental Laws and the time period during which such costs are likely to be incurred.\nGovernmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations. Violators of Environmental Laws may be subject to civil, criminal and administrative penalties, injunctions or both. Failure to comply with Environmental Laws may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of operations and/or permits, limitations on production, or increased operating costs. In addition, private plaintiffs may initiate lawsuits for personal injury, property damage, diminution in property value or other relief as a result of our operations. Environmental Laws, and the interpretation or enforcement thereof, are subject to change and may become more stringent in the future, potentially resulting in substantial future costs or capital or operating expenses. We devote considerable resources to complying with Environmental Laws and managing environmental liabilities. We have developed programs to identify requirements under and maintain compliance with Environmental Laws; however, we cannot predict with certainty the impact of increased and more stringent regulation on our operations, future capital expenditure requirements, or the cost of compliance. Based upon our experience to date, we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing Environmental Laws, and liabilities for known environmental claims pursuant to such Environmental Laws, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety Regulations\nThe following summarizes the principal Environmental Laws affecting our business.\nWaste Management.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our operations are subject to statutes and regulations addressing the contamination by, and management of, hazardous substances and solid and hazardous wastes. In the United States, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), also known as the \u201cSuperfund\u201d law, and comparable state laws, generally impose strict joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and related liabilities, on defined classes of\u2009 \u201cpotentially responsible parties\u201d (\u201cPRPs\u201d). PRPs can be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault, the legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site. We have been, and may become, subject to liability under CERCLA for cleanup costs or investigation or clean up obligations or related third-party claims in connection with releases of hazardous substances at or from our current or former sites or offsite waste disposal facilities used by us, including those caused by predecessors or relating to divested properties or operations.\nWe must also comply with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (\u201cRCRA\u201d), and comparable state laws regulating the treatment, storage, disposal, remediation and transportation of solid and hazardous wastes. These laws impose management requirements on generators and transporters of such wastes and on the owners and operators of treatment, storage and disposal facilities. As current or historic recyclers of chemical waste, certain of our subsidiaries have been, and are likely to be, the focus of extensive compliance reviews by environmental regulatory authorities under RCRA. Our subsidiary Phibro-Tech currently has a RCRA operating permit for its Santa Fe Springs, California facility, for which a renewal application is under review and a draft permit has been issued for public review and comment. Phibro-Tech initially submitted an application for renewal of its permit for the Santa Fe Springs facility in 1996. We are unable to predict when the State of California will make a final permitting decision. Until the State of California issues its final decision on the renewal application, the facility is continuing to operate under the exiting permit. Phibro-Tech has updated its permit application on several occasions, and Department of Toxic Substances Control has approved a number of permit modifications to the existing permit. In addition, because we or our \n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nsubsidiaries have closed several facilities that had been the subject of RCRA permits, we or our subsidiaries have been and will be required to investigate and remediate certain environmental contamination conditions at these closed plant sites within the requirements of RCRA corrective action programs.\nFederal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We must comply with regulations related to the discharge of pollutants to the waters of the United States without governmental authorization, including those pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.\nChemical Product Registration Requirements.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We must comply with regulations related to the testing, manufacturing, labeling, registration and safety analysis of our products in order to distribute many of our products, including, for example, in the United States, the federal Toxic Substances Control Act and Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, and in the European Union, the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (\u201cREACH\u201d).\nAir Emissions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our operations are subject to the U.S. Clean Air Act (the \u201cCAA\u201d) and comparable U.S. state and foreign statutes and regulations, which regulate emissions of various air pollutants and contaminants. Certain of the CAA\u2019s regulatory programs are the subject of ongoing review and/or are subject to ongoing litigation, such as the rules establishing new Maximum Achievable Control Technology for industrial boilers; significant expenditures may be required to meet current and emerging air quality standards. Regulatory agencies can also impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other air quality regulations. States may choose to set more stringent air emissions rules than those in the CAA. State, national and international authorities have also issued requirements focusing on greenhouse gas reductions. In the United States, the EPA has promulgated federal greenhouse gas regulations under the CAA affecting certain sources. In addition, a number of state, local and regional greenhouse gas initiatives are also being developed or are already in place. In Israel and Brazil, implementation of the Kyoto Protocol requirements regarding greenhouse gas emission reductions consists of energy efficiency regulations, carbon dioxide emissions allowances trading and renewable energy requirements.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Our capital expenditures relating to environmental, health and safety regulations were $2.4 million for the fiscal year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023. See \u201cBusiness\u2009\u2014\u2009Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations\u201d for further descriptions. Our environmental capital expenditure plans cover, among other things, the currently expected costs associated with known permit requirements relating to facility improvements.\nContamination and Hazardous Substance Risks\nInvestigation, Remediation and Monitoring Activities\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certain of PAHC\u2019s subsidiaries that are currently or were historically engaged in recycling and other activities involving hazardous materials have been required to perform site investigations at their active, closed and former facilities and neighboring properties. Contamination of soil, groundwater and other environmental media has been identified or is suspected at several of these locations, including Santa Fe Springs, California; Powder Springs, Georgia; Union, Illinois; Sewaren, New Jersey; Sumter, South Carolina; and Joliet, Illinois, and regulatory authorities have required, and will continue to require, further investigation, corrective action and monitoring over future\u00a0years. These subsidiaries also have been, and in the future may be, required to undertake additional capital improvements as part of these actions. In addition, RCRA and other applicable statutes and regulations require these subsidiaries to develop closure and post-closure plans for their facilities and in the event of a facility closure, obtain a permit that sets forth a closure plan for investigation, remediation and monitoring and requires post-closure monitoring and maintenance for up to 30\u00a0years. We believe we are in material compliance with these requirements and maintain adequate reserves to complete remediation and monitoring obligations at these locations.\nIn connection with past acquisitions and divestitures, we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us, or may in the future require us, to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites we no longer own or operate. Under the terms of the sale of the former facility in Joliet, Illinois, Phibro-Tech remains responsible for any required investigation and remediation of the site attributable to conditions at the site at the time of the February\u00a02011 sale date, and we believe we have sufficient reserves to cover the cost of the remediation.\nParticipating Responsible Parties (\u201cPRPs\u201d) at Omega Chemical Superfund Site.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The EPA is investigating and planning for the remediation of offsite contaminated groundwater that has migrated from the Omega Chemical \n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCorporation Superfund Site (\u201cOmega Chemical Site\u201d), which is upgradient of Phibro-Tech\u2019s Santa Fe Springs, California facility. The EPA has entered into a settlement agreement with a group of companies that sent chemicals to the Omega Chemical Site for processing and recycling (\u201cOPOG\u201d) to remediate the contaminated groundwater that has migrated from the Omega Chemical Site in accordance with a general remedy selected by EPA. The EPA has named Phibro-Tech and certain other subsidiaries of PAHC as PRPs due to groundwater contamination from Phibro-Tech\u2019s Santa Fe Springs facility that has allegedly commingled with contaminated groundwater from the Omega Chemical Site. In September\u00a02012, the EPA notified approximately 140 PRPs, including Phibro-Tech and the other subsidiaries, that they have been identified as potentially responsible for remedial action for the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site and for EPA oversight and response costs. Phibro-Tech contends that any groundwater contamination at its site is localized and due to historical operations that pre-date Phibro-Tech and/or contaminated groundwater that has migrated from upgradient properties. In addition, a successor to a prior owner of the Phibro-Tech site has asserted that PAHC and Phibro-Tech are obligated to provide indemnification for its potential liability and defense costs relating to the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site. PAHC and Phibro-Tech have vigorously contested this position and have asserted that the successor to the prior owner is required to indemnify Phibro-Tech for its potential liability and defense costs. Furthermore, several members of OPOG filed a complaint under CERCLA and RCRA in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against many of the PRPs allegedly associated with the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site (including Phibro-Tech) for contribution toward past and future costs associated with the investigation and remediation of the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site, and the United States Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, sent Phibro-Tech and certain other PRPs a pre-litigation notice letter in August 2022 regarding potential CERCLA Sec. 107 cost recovery claims seeking unrecovered past costs related to the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site, along with a declaration allocating liability for future costs. \nIn February 2023, the plaintiffs in the OPOG lawsuit, and certain defendants in the OPOG lawsuit, including Phibro-Tech, signed a definitive settlement agreement that provides for a \u201ccash-out\u201d settlement, with contribution protection, for Phibro-Tech and its affiliates (as well as certain other defendants) releasing Phibro-Tech and its affiliates from liability for contamination of the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site (with certain exceptions), including past and future EPA response costs that were the subject of the August 2022 pre-litigation letter sent by the DOJ on behalf of the EPA. As part of the settlement, Phibro-Tech also resolved all claims for indemnification and contribution between Phibro-Tech and the successor to the prior owner of the Phibro-Tech site. The definitive settlement agreement contemplates cash payments by Phibro-Tech and one of its affiliates over a period ending in February 2024. The definitive settlement agreement is subject to formal approval by the EPA, the DOJ and the district court. During the year ended June 30, 2023, we recognized expenses for the definitive settlement agreement and other related costs, which are included in our consolidated statement of operations as selling, general and administrative expenses.\nPotential Claims.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to cleanup obligations, we could also be held liable for all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage, which liability may not be covered by insurance.\nEnvironmental Accruals and Financial Assurance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have established environmental accruals to cover known remediation and monitoring costs at certain of our current and former facilities. Our accruals for environmental liabilities are recorded by calculating our best estimate of probable and reasonably estimable future costs using current information that is available at the time of the accrual. Our accruals for environmental liabilities totaled $8.5 million and $4.3 million as of June\u00a030,\u00a02023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn certain instances, regulatory authorities have required us to provide financial assurance for estimated costs of remediation, corrective action, monitoring and closure and post-closure plans. Our subsidiaries, in most instances, have chosen to provide the required financial assurance by means of surety bonds or letters of credit issued pursuant to our revolving credit facility. As of June\u00a030, 2023, surety bonds and letters of credit provided $12.9\u00a0million of financial assurance.\nWorkplace Health and Safety\nWe are committed to manufacturing safe products and achieving a safe workplace. Our Environmental Health and Safety (\u201cEHS\u201d) Global Director, along with regional and site-based EHS professionals, manage environmental, health and safety matters throughout the Company. The site managers are responsible for implementing the established EHS \n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncontrols. To protect employees, we have established health and safety policies, programs and processes at all our manufacturing sites. An external EHS audit is performed at each of our sites as needed based on the conditions at the respective sites.\nWhere You Can Find More Information\nWe are subject to the information and periodic and current reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and, in accordance therewith, will file periodic and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).

If any of the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In any such case, the trading price of our Class\u00a0A common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that the Company presently deems immaterial may also impair its business operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company\u2019s results could materially differ from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks it faces described below and elsewhere. See also \u201cForward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors Summary.\u201d\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nOutbreaks of animal diseases could significantly reduce demand for our products.\nSales of our food animal products could be materially adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by food animals, which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of food animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein. The demand for our products could be significantly affected by outbreaks of animal diseases, and such occurrences may have a material adverse impact on the sale of our products and our financial condition and results of operations. The outbreaks of disease are beyond our control and could significantly affect demand for our products and consumer perceptions of certain meat products. An outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of chicken, pork, beef or other products to or from our customers. This could also create adverse publicity that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products successfully and on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, outbreaks of disease carried by animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animal-derived food products or result in reduced exports of such products, either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions, which may reduce demand for our products due to reduced herd or flock sizes.\nIn recent years, outbreaks of African Swine Fever, primarily in China, have reduced animal populations and have reduced consumer demand for pork in the affected markets. In the past decade, there has been substantial publicity regarding H1N1, known as North American (or Swine) Influenza and, H5N1, known as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, in both the human population and among birds. According to the WHO, in 2022, 67 countries in five continents reported H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza outbreaks in poultry and wild birds to the World Organization for Animal Health, with more than 131 million domestic poultry lost due to death or culling in affected farms and villages. There have also been concerns relating to E. coli in beef and Salmonella in poultry and other food poisoning micro-organisms in meats and other foods. Consumers may associate human health fears with animal diseases, food, food production or food animals whether or not it is scientifically valid, which may have an adverse impact on the \n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\ndemand for animal protein. Occurrences of this type could significantly affect demand for animal protein, which in turn could affect the demand for our products in a manner that has a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere.\nOutbreaks of an exotic or highly contagious disease in a country where we produce our products may result in other countries halting importation of our products for fear that our product may be contaminated with the exotic organism.\nPerceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products could cause a decline in the sales of those products.\nOur business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry. Some in the public perceive risks to human health related to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize certain of our products, including certain of our MFA products. In particular, there is increased focus in the United States, the E.U., China and other countries on the use of antimicrobials in the livestock industry. In the United States, this focus is primarily on the use of medically important antimicrobials, which include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health and are listed in the Appendix of the FDA-CVM Guidance for Industry (GFI) 152. As defined by the FDA, medically important antimicrobials (\u201cMIAs\u201d) include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health and are listed in the Appendix of GFI 152. Our products that contain virginiamycin, oxytetracycline or neomycin are classified by the FDA as medically important antimicrobials and are included in the GFI 152 list. The FDA announced its intention to further review the GFI 152 list and to review labeling directions of products on the GFI 152 list, which may lead to increased restrictions on the use of these products. In addition to the United States, the World Health Organization (WHO), the E.U., Australia and Canada have promulgated rating lists for antimicrobials that are used in veterinary medicine and that include certain of our products. The classification of our products as MIAs or similar listings may lead to a decline in the demand for and production of food products derived from animals that utilize our products and, in turn, demand for our products. Rules or regulations adopted by any territory that restrict the use of our products, especially our antibacterial products, which require animals or animal origin products imported into that territory to be produced under the same conditions as are required within the territory could result in a reduction or elimination of the use of our products in countries that export animals or animal origin products to such territories. Livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of nutrition and health-related concerns, animal rights and other concerns. Any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries, including us. In addition, campaigns by interest groups, activists and others with respect to perceived risks associated with the use of our products in animals, including position statements by livestock producers and their customers based on non-use of certain medicated products in livestock production, whether or not scientifically supported, could affect public perceptions and reduce the use of our products. Those adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in animals could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictions on the use of antibacterials in food-producing animals may become more prevalent.\nThe issue of the potential transfer of antibacterial resistance from bacteria from food-producing animals to human bacterial pathogens, and the causality and impact of that transfer, are the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion. Antibacterials refer to molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a sub-categorization of the products that make up our medicated feed additives portfolios. In some countries, this issue has led to government restrictions on the use of specific antibacterials in some food-producing animals, regardless of the route of administration (in feed, water, intra-mammary, topical, injectable or other route of administration). These restrictions include prohibitions on use of antibacterials for non-therapeutic uses, preventative use, duration of use and requiring veterinary oversight to use products. These restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty.\nEffective January\u00a01, 2017, we voluntarily removed non-therapeutic claims from several of our antibacterial products sold in the United States, in order to align with the FDA\u2019s GFI 209 and GFI 213. The FDA objective, as described in GFI 209 and GFI 213, was to eliminate the production (non-therapeutic) uses of medically important antimicrobials administered in feed or water to food producing animals while providing for the continued use of medically important antimicrobials in food-producing animals for treatment, control and prevention of disease (\u201ctherapeutic\u201d use) under the \n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\nsupervision of a veterinarian. The FDA indicated that it took this action to help preserve the efficacy of medically important antimicrobials to treat infections in humans.\nOur global sales of antibacterials, anticoccidials and other products, including our Mecadox product, were $387 million, $362 million and $330 million for the years ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We cannot predict whether concerns regarding the use of antibacterials will result in additional restrictions, expanded regulations or consumer preferences to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in food-producing animals, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. \nIf the FDA withdraws approval of our Mecadox (carbadox) product, the loss of sales of such product could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Mecadox (carbadox) product has been approved for use in food animals in the United States for over 50 years. Certain regulatory bodies have raised concerns about the possible presence of certain residues of our carbadox product in meat from animals that consume the product. The product was banned for use in the European Union in 1998 and has been banned in several other countries outside the United States. \nIn April 2016, the FDA began initial steps to withdraw approval of carbadox via a regulatory process known as a Notice of Opportunity for Hearing (\u201cNOOH\u201d), due to concerns that certain residues from the product may persist in animal tissues for longer than previously determined. In the years following, Phibro has continued an ongoing process of responding collaboratively and transparently to the FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine (\u201cCVM\u201d) inquiries and has provided extensive and meticulous research and data that confirmed the safety of carbadox. In July 2020, the FDA announced it would not proceed to a hearing on the scientific concerns raised in the 2016 NOOH, consistent with the normal regulatory procedure, but instead announced that it was withdrawing the 2016 NOOH and issuing a proposed order to review the regulatory method for carbadox. Phibro reiterated the safety of carbadox and the appropriateness of the regulatory method and offered to work with the CVM to generate additional data to support the existing regulatory method or select a suitable alternative regulatory method. \nIn the event the FDA continues to assert that carbadox should be removed from the market, we will argue that we are entitled to and expect to have a full evidentiary hearing on the merits before an administrative law judge. Should we be unable to successfully defend the safety of the product, the loss of carbadox sales will have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Sales of Mecadox (carbadox) for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, were approximately $20 million.\nSee also \u201c\u2009\u2014\u2009We are subject to product registration and authorization regulations in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate and/or distribute our products, including the United States and member states of the European Union\u201d; \u201cBusiness\u2009\u2014Compliance with Government Regulation\u2009\u2014\u2009United States \u2014 Carbadox\u201d; and \u201cBusiness \u2014 Compliance with Government Regulation \u2014 Global Policy and Guidance.\u201d\nA material portion of our sales are generated by antibacterials and other related products.\nOur medicated products business is comprised of a relatively small number of compounds and accounted for approximately 40% of net sales for each of the years ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023 and 2022. The significant loss of antibacterial or other related product sales for any reason, including product bans or restrictions, public perception, competition or any of the other risks related to such products as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business may be negatively affected by weather conditions and the availability of natural resources.\nThe animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by changing disease pressures and by weather conditions, as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weather-related pressures from pests and diseases. As a result, we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.\nIn addition, livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources, including abundant rainfall to sustain large supplies of drinking water, grasslands and grain production. Their animals\u2019 health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or \n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\nfloods, droughts or other weather conditions. In the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water, livestock producers may purchase less of our products.\nAdverse weather conditions, including excessive cold or heat, natural disasters, floods, droughts and other events, could negatively impact our livestock customers by impairing the health or growth of their animals or the production or availability of feed. Such events can also interfere with our customers\u2019 operations due to power outages, fuel shortages, damage to their farms or facilities or disruption of transportation channels. In addition, droughts can lead to reduced availability of grazing pastures, forcing cattle producers to cull their herds. Fewer heads of cattle could result in reduced demand for our products. Further heat waves may cause stress in animals and lead to increased vulnerability to disease, reduced fertility rates and reduced milk production. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters may also have a material impact on the aquaculture business. Changes in water temperatures could affect the timing of reproduction and growth of various fish species, as well as trigger the outbreak of certain water borne diseases. \nAdverse weather events and natural disasters may also interfere with and negatively impact operations at our manufacturing sites, research and development facilities and offices, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, especially if the impact of an event or disaster is frequent or prolonged.  \nA pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease in humans, such as COVID-19, may materially and adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nOur business is exposed to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics such as the novel coronavirus and its variants (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected workforces, customers, suppliers, consumer sentiment, economies and financial markets and led to an economic downturn in many countries in which we operate. Disruptions due to a resurgence of COVID-19 or other similar health epidemics could negatively impact our manufacturing facilities, and our logistics and supply chain operations, as well as those of our customers, third-party manufacturers, suppliers and end users of our products who raise animals or who process meat, milk, eggs and seafood for human consumption and may result in a period of economic and business disruption and could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and similar outbreaks could lead to decreased demand for protein, which may lead to end users of our products reducing their herd or flock sizes. In addition, demand for protein could be reduced because consumers may associate human health fears related to COVID-19 of other outbreaks with animal diseases, food, food production or food animals, whether it is scientifically valid. Reductions in demand for animal protein resulting from these factors could in turn affect the demand for our products in a manner that has a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact of a pandemic or similar public health crises is uncertain and subject to change and could also exacerbate the other risks discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We cannot predict with certainty the full scope and severity of any potential disruptions to our business, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition, but we expect that the resulting adverse impact on our business and financial results could be material.\nClimate change could have a material adverse impact on our operations and our customers\u2019 businesses.\nOur operations, and the activities of our customers, could be disrupted by climate change. The physical impact of climate change may prompt shifts in regulations or consumer preferences which in turn could have negative consequences for our and our customers\u2019 businesses. Climate change may negatively impact our customers\u2019 operations, particularly those in the livestock industry, through climate-related impacts such as increased air and water temperatures, rising water levels and increased incidence of disease in livestock. Potential physical risks from climate change may include altered distribution and intensity of rainfall, prolonged droughts or flooding, increased frequency of wildfires and other natural disasters, rising sea levels and a rising heat index, any of which could cause negative impacts to our and our customers\u2019 businesses. If such events affect our customers\u2019 businesses, they may purchase fewer of our products, and our revenues may be negatively impacted. Climate driven changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \nThere has been a broad range of proposed and promulgated state, national and international regulations aimed at reducing the effects of climate change. Such regulations could result in additional costs to maintain compliance and \n30\n\n\nTable of Contents\nadditional income or other taxes. Climate change regulations continue to evolve, and it is not possible to accurately estimate potential future compliance costs.\nThe testing, manufacturing and marketing of certain of our products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and other countries, including, but not limited to, the FDA.\nAmong other requirements, FDA approval of antibacterials and other medicated products, including the manufacturing processes and facilities used to produce such products, is required before such products may be marketed in the United States. Further, cross-clearance approvals are generally required for such products to be used in combination in animal feed. Similarly, marketing approval by a foreign governmental authority is typically required before such products may be marketed in a particular foreign country. In addition to approval of the product and its labeling, regulatory authorities typically require approval and periodic inspection of the manufacturing facilities. In order to obtain FDA approval of a new animal health product, we must, among other things, demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that the product is safe and effective for its intended uses and that we are capable of manufacturing the product with procedures that conform to FDA\u2019s current cGMP regulations, which must be followed at all times.\nAudits related to cGMP standards are typically carried out by the FDA on a two-year cycle. We are routinely subject to these inspections and respond to the FDA to address any concerns they may make in their inspectional observations (Form 483). Although it is our objective to remain in full conformance with U.S. cGMP standards, there can be no assurance that future inspections will not raise adverse inspectional observations. Failure to comply with cGMP standards could have a material impact on our business and financial results.\nThe process of seeking FDA approvals can be costly, time-consuming, and subject to unanticipated and significant delays. There can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted to us on a timely basis, or at all. Any delay in obtaining or any failure to obtain FDA or foreign government approvals or the suspension or revocation of such approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce and market medicated feed additive products and to generate product revenue. For more information on FDA and foreign government approvals and cGMP issues, see \u201cBusiness\u2009\u2014\u2009Compliance with Government Regulation.\u201d\nWe may experience declines in the sales volume and prices of our products as the result of the continuing trend toward consolidation of certain customer and distributor groups as well as the emergence of large buying groups.\nWe make a majority of our sales to integrated poultry, swine and beef and dairy cattle operations and to a number of regional and national feed companies, distributors, co-ops and blenders. Food animal producers, particularly, swine and poultry producers, and our distributors have seen recent consolidation in their industries. Significant consolidation of our customers and distributors may result in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage and consequently increasing the product pricing pressures facing our business. Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups potentially could enable such groups to attempt to extract price discounts on our products. Moreover, if, as a result of increased leverage, customers require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished, we could decide not to sell our products to a particular customer, which could result in a decrease in our revenues. Consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products and replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors. The result of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income.\nLivestock producers may experience increased feed, fuel, transportation and other key costs or may experience decreased animal protein prices or sales, inflationary pressures as a result of interest rate increases or otherwise and including as a result of the uncertainties and potential economic downturn relating to a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or relating to the ongoing armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. International sanctions, trade disputes and tariffs could reduce demand for our customers\u2019 products. These trends could cause deterioration in the financial condition of our livestock producer customers, potentially inhibiting their ability to purchase our products or pay us for products delivered. Our livestock producer customers may offset rising costs by reducing spending on our products, including by switching to lower-cost alternatives to our products.\n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\nGeneric products may be viewed as more cost-effective than certain of our products.\nWe face competition from products produced by other companies, including generic alternatives to certain of our products. We depend primarily on trade secrets to provide us with competitive advantages for many of our products. The protection afforded is limited by the availability of new competitive products or generic versions of existing products that can successfully compete with our products. As a result, we may face competition from new competitive products or lower-priced generic alternatives to many of our products. Generic competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of pricing, and generic products are an increasing\u00a0percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions. If animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic products, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAdvances in veterinary medical practices and animal health technologies could negatively affect the market for our products.\nThe market for our products could be impacted negatively by the introduction and/or broad market acceptance of newly developed or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products, including \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cholistic\u201d health products or specially bred disease-resistant animals. In addition, technological breakthroughs by others may obviate our technology and reduce or eliminate the market for our products. Introduction or acceptance of such products or technologies could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe misuse or extra-label use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages.\nOur products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for, among other things, the prevention, control and/or treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species, in some cases subject to certain dosage levels or minimum withdrawal periods prior to the slaughter date. There may be increased risk of product liability if livestock producers or others attempt any extra-label use of our products, including the use of our products in species for which they have not been approved, or at dosage levels or periods prior to withdrawal that have not been approved. If we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for extra-label use, such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties. The imposition of such fines and penalties could also affect our reputation and position within the industry. Even if we were not responsible for having promoted the extra-label use, concerns could arise about the safety of the resulting meat in the human food supply. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe public perception of the safety, quality and efficacy of certain of our animal health products may harm our reputation.\nThe public perception of the safety, quality and efficacy of certain of our animal health products, whether or not these concerns are scientifically or clinically supported, may lead to product recalls, withdrawals, suspensions or declining sales as well as product liability and other claims.\nRegulatory actions based on these types of safety, quality or efficacy concerns could impact all, or a significant portion of a product\u2019s sales and could, depending on the circumstances, materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, we depend on positive perceptions of the safety, quality and efficacy of our products, and animal health products generally, by our customers, veterinarians and end-users, and such concerns may harm our reputation. In some countries, these perceptions may be exacerbated by the existence of counterfeit versions of our products, which, depending on the legal and law enforcement recourse available in the jurisdiction where the counterfeiting occurs, may be difficult to police or stop. These concerns and the related harm to our reputation could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether such reports are accurate.\n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe are dependent on suppliers having current regulatory approvals, and the failure of those suppliers to maintain these approvals or other challenges in replacing any of those suppliers could affect our supply of materials or affect the distribution or sale of our products.\nSuppliers and third-party contract manufacturers for our animal health and mineral nutrition products or the active pharmaceutical ingredients or other materials we use in our products, like us, are subject to extensive regulatory compliance. If any one of these third parties discontinues its supply to us because of changes in the regulatory environment to which such third parties are subject, significant regulatory violations or for any other reason, or an adverse event occurs at one of their facilities, the interruption in the supply of these materials could decrease sales of our affected products. In this event, we may seek to enter into agreements with third parties to purchase active ingredients, raw materials or products or to lease or purchase new manufacturing facilities. We may be unable to find a third party willing or able to provide the necessary products or facilities suitable for manufacturing pharmaceuticals on terms acceptable to us or the cost of those pharmaceuticals may be prohibitive. If we have to obtain substitute materials or products, additional regulatory approvals will likely be required, as approvals are typically specific to a single product produced by a specified manufacturer in a specified facility and there can be no assurances that such regulatory approvals will be obtained. As such, the use of new facilities also requires regulatory approvals. While we take measures where economically feasible and available to secure back-up suppliers, the continued receipt of active ingredients or products from a sole source supplier could create challenges if a sole source was interrupted. We may not be able to provide adequate and timely product to eliminate any threat of interruption of supply of our products to customers and these problems may materially adversely impact our business.\nThe raw materials used by us and our third-party contract manufacturers in the manufacture of our products can be subject to price fluctuations and their availability can be limited.\nWhile the selling prices of our products tend to increase or decrease over time with the cost of raw materials, such changes may not occur simultaneously or to the same degree. The costs of certain of our significant raw materials are subject to considerable volatility, and we generally do not engage in activities to hedge the costs of our raw materials and our third-party contract manufacturers may demand price increases related to increases in the costs of raw materials. In addition, we may be subject to new or increased tariffs on imported raw materials with limited ability to pass those increased costs through to our customers. Although no single raw material accounted for more than 5% of our cost of goods sold for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, volatility in raw material costs can result in significant fluctuations in our costs of goods sold of the affected products. The costs of raw materials used by our Mineral Nutrition business are particularly subject to fluctuations in global commodities markets and cost changes in the underlying commodities markets typically lead directly to a corresponding change in our revenues. Although we attempt to adjust the prices of our products to reflect significant changes in raw material costs, we may not be able to pass any increases in raw material costs through to our customers in the form of price increases. Significant increases in the costs of raw materials, if not offset by product price increases, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The supply of certain of our raw materials is dependent on third party suppliers. There is no guarantee that supply shortages or disruptions of such raw materials will not occur and the likelihood of such supply shortages and disruptions has been, and may continue to be, increased due to global supply chain disruptions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In addition, if any one of these third parties discontinues its supply to us, or an adverse event occurs at one of their facilities, the interruption in the supply of these materials could decrease sales of our affected products. In the event that we cannot procure necessary major raw materials from other suppliers, the occurrence of any of these may have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur revenues are dependent on the continued operation of our various manufacturing facilities.\nAlthough presently all our manufacturing facilities are considered to be in good condition, the operation of our manufacturing facilities involves many risks which could cause product interruptions, including the breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment, construction delays, mislabeling, shortages of materials, labor problems, power outages, political and social instability, the improper installation or operation of equipment, natural disasters, terrorist activities, armed conflicts, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases, such as COVID-19 in humans or African Swine Fever in swine, near our production sites and the need to comply with environmental and other directives of governmental agencies. In addition, regulatory authorities such as the FDA typically require approval and periodic inspection of the manufacturing facilities to confirm compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, and those requirements may be enforced by various means, including seizures and injunctions. Certain of our product lines are \n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmanufactured at a single facility, and certain of our product lines are manufactured at a single facility with limited capacity at a second facility, and production would not be easily transferable to another site. The occurrence of material operational problems, including but not limited to the above events, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes. The unpredictability of a product\u2019s regulatory or commercial success or failure, the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand (including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition) increase the potential for capacity imbalances. In addition, construction of manufacturing sites is expensive, and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites, which is uncertain.\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the relevant tax laws, regulations and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates. Modifications to key elements of the U.S. or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur consolidated effective tax rate is subject to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our cross-border arrangements and subject us to additional tax, adversely affecting our expected consolidated effective tax rate and our tax liability. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or other material foreign jurisdictions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, our tax returns and other tax filings and positions are subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations or the effects on our consolidated financial statements.\nA significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions and are subject to the economic, political, legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business.\nOur international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following:\n\u25cf\nvolatility in the international financial markets;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with governmental controls;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with foreign labor laws;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with Environmental Laws;\n\u25cf\nburdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to EHS requirements;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws, regulations, government controls or enforcement practices with respect to our business and the businesses of our customers;\n\u25cf\npolitical and social instability, including crime, civil disturbance, terrorist activities, outbreaks of disease and pandemics and armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine;\n\u25cf\ntrade restrictions, export controls and sanctions laws and restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities, including restrictions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury;\n\u25cf\ngovernment limitations on foreign ownership;\n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\ngovernment takeover or nationalization of businesses;\n\u25cf\nchanges in tax laws and tariffs;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the economic, business, competitive and regulatory environment, including changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar or high inflation;\n\u25cf\nimposition of anti-dumping and countervailing duties or other trade-related sanctions;\n\u25cf\ncosts and difficulties and compliance risks in staffing, managing and monitoring international operations;\n\u25cf\ncorruption risk inherent in business arrangements and regulatory contacts with foreign government entities;\n\u25cf\nlonger payment cycles and increased exposure to counterparty risk; and\n\u25cf\nadditional limitations on transferring personal information between countries or other restrictions on the processing of personal information.\nThe multinational nature of our business subjects us to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our cross-border arrangements and subject us to additional tax, adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability.\nIn addition, international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs, as well as restrictions and sanctions that may be imposed on one or more persons and/or jurisdictions in which we operate, including those arising from the ongoing armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technology. A failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings, monetary or non-monetary penalties, or both, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services, and damage to our reputation. In addition, variations in the pricing of our products in different jurisdictions may result in the unauthorized importation of our products between jurisdictions. While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any of them could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in any of these laws, regulations or requirements, or the political environment in a particular country, may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets, including investment, procurement and repatriation of earnings.\nWe are subject to product registration and authorization regulations in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate and/or distribute our products, including the United States and member states of the European Union.\nWe are subject to regulations related to testing, manufacturing, labeling, registration and safety analysis in order to lawfully distribute many of our products, including for example, in the United States, the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and in the European Union, the Regulation on REACH. We are also subject to similar requirements in many of the other jurisdictions in which we operate and/or distribute our products. In some cases, such registrations are subject to periodic review by relevant authorities. Such regulations may lead to governmental restrictions or cancellations of, or refusal to issue, certain registrations or authorizations, or cause us or our customers to make product substitutions in the future. Such regulations may also lead to increased third party scrutiny and personal injury or product liability claims. Compliance with these regulations can be difficult, costly and time consuming and liabilities or costs relating to such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant assets located outside the United States and a significant portion of our sales and earnings is attributable to operations conducted abroad that may be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and other inherent risks.\nAs of June\u00a030,\u00a02023, we had manufacturing and direct sales operations in 25 countries and sold our products in over 80 countries. Our operations outside the United States accounted for 58% and 56% of our consolidated assets as of June\u00a030,\u00a02023 and 2022, respectively, and 41% and 40% of our consolidated net sales for the\u00a0years ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023 and 2022, respectively. Our foreign operations are subject to currency exchange fluctuations and restrictions, political instability in some countries, and uncertainty of, and governmental control over, commercial rights.\n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\nChanges in the relative values of currencies take place from time to time and could in the future adversely affect our results of operations as well as our ability to meet interest and principal obligations on our indebtedness. To the extent that the U.S. dollar fluctuates relative to the applicable foreign currency, our results are favorably or unfavorably affected. We may from time to time manage this exposure by entering into foreign currency contracts. Such contracts generally are entered into with respect to anticipated costs denominated in foreign currencies for which timing of the payment can be reasonably estimated. No assurances can be given that such hedging activities will not result in, or will be successful in preventing, losses that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There are times when we do not hedge against foreign currency fluctuations and therefore are subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, international manufacturing, sales and raw materials sourcing are subject to other inherent risks, including possible nationalization or expropriation, labor unrest, political instability, price and exchange controls, limitation on foreign participation in local enterprises, health-care regulation, export duties and quotas, domestic and international customs and tariffs, compliance with export controls and sanctions laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws and regulations governing international trade, unexpected changes in regulatory environments, difficulty in obtaining distribution and support, and potentially adverse tax consequences. Although such risks have not had a material adverse effect on us in the past, these factors could have a material adverse impact on our ability to increase or maintain our international sales or on our results of operations in the future.\nWe have manufacturing facilities located in Israel and a portion of our net sales and earnings is attributable to products produced and operations conducted in Israel.\nOur Israeli manufacturing facilities and local operations accounted for 27% and 28% of our consolidated assets, as of June\u00a030,\u00a02023 and 2022, and 19% and 19% of our consolidated net sales for the\u00a0years ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023 and 2022, respectively. We maintain manufacturing facilities in Israel, which manufacture:\n\u25cf\nanticoccidials and antimicrobials, most of which are exported;\n\u25cf\nvaccines, a substantial portion of which are exported; and\n\u25cf\nanimal health pharmaceuticals, nutritional specialty products and trace minerals for the domestic animal industry.\nA substantial portion of this production is exported from Israel to major world markets. Accordingly, our Israeli operations are dependent on foreign markets and the ability to reach those markets. Hostilities between Israel and its neighbors may hinder Israel\u2019s international trade. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain countries, companies and organizations continue to participate in a boycott of Israeli firms and other companies doing business in Israel or with Israeli companies. We do not believe that the boycott has had a material adverse effect on us, but we cannot provide assurance that restrictive laws, policies or practices directed toward Israel or Israeli businesses will not have an adverse impact on our operations or expansion of our business. Our business, financial condition and results of operations in Israel may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control, such as currency fluctuations, energy shortages and other political, social and economic developments in or affecting Israel, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel.\nWe have manufacturing facilities located in Brazil and a portion of our sales and earnings is attributable to products produced and operations conducted in Brazil.\nOur Brazilian manufacturing facilities and local operations accounted for 14% and 12% of our consolidated assets, as of June\u00a030,\u00a02023 and 2022, respectively, and 16% and 15% of our consolidated net sales for the\u00a0years ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023 and 2022, respectively. We maintain manufacturing facilities in Brazil, which manufacture virginiamycin, semduramicin, salinomycin and nicarbazin. Our Brazilian facilities also produce Stafac, Aviax, Aviax Plus, Coxistac, Nicarb, Kamoran\n\u00ae\n, and Terramycin granular formulations. A substantial portion of the production is exported from Brazil to major world markets. Accordingly, our Brazilian operations are dependent on foreign markets and the ability to reach those markets.\n36\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations in Brazil may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control, such as currency fluctuations, energy shortages and other political, social and economic developments in or affecting Brazil, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.\nCertain of our employees are covered by collective bargaining or other labor agreements.\nAs of June\u00a030,\u00a02023, approximately 290 of our Israeli employees and 460 of our Brazilian employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees. There can be no assurance that we will not experience a work stoppage or strike at our manufacturing facilities. A prolonged work stoppage or strike at any of our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key personnel may disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur operations and future success are dependent on the continued efforts of our senior executive officers and other key personnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain executives, we may not be able to retain all of our senior executive officers and key employees. These senior executive officers and other key employees may be hired by our competitors, some of which have considerably more financial resources than we do. The loss of the services of any of our senior executive officers or other key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur R&D relies on evaluations in animals, which may become subject to bans or additional regulations.\nAs a company that produces animal health medicines and vaccines, evaluation of our existing and new products in animals is required in order to be able to register our products. Animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity. Some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing. To the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful, our R&D, and by extension our financial condition and results of operations, could be materially adversely affected. In addition, negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation.\nOur operations, properties and subsidiaries are subject to a wide variety of complex and stringent federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing pollution; protection of the environment; the use, management and release of hazardous materials, substances and wastes; air emissions; greenhouse gas emissions; water use, supply and discharges; the investigation and remediation of contamination; the manufacture, distribution and sale of regulated materials, including pesticides; the importing, exporting and transportation of products; and the health and safety of our employees and the public (collectively, \u201cEnvironmental Laws\u201d). See \u201cBusiness\u2009\u2014\u2009Environmental, Health and Safety.\u201d\nPursuant to Environmental Laws, certain of our subsidiaries are required to obtain and maintain numerous governmental permits, licenses, registrations, authorizations and approvals, including \u201cRCRA Part\u00a0B\u201d hazardous waste permits, to conduct various aspects of their operations (collectively \u201cEnvironmental Permits\u201d), any of which may be subject to suspension, revocation, modification, termination or denial under certain circumstances or which may not be renewed upon their expiration for various reasons, including noncompliance. See \u201cBusiness\u2009\u2014\u2009Environmental, Health and Safety.\u201d These Environmental Permits can be difficult, costly and time consuming to obtain and may contain conditions that limit our operations. Additionally, any failure to obtain and maintain such Environmental Permits could restrict or otherwise prohibit certain aspects of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have expended, and may be required to expend in the future, substantial funds for compliance with Environmental Laws. As recyclers of hazardous metal-containing chemical wastes, certain of our subsidiaries have been, and are likely to be, the focus of extensive compliance reviews by environmental regulatory authorities under Environmental Laws, including those relating to the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes under the RCRA. In the past, some of our subsidiaries have paid fines and entered into consent orders to address alleged environmental violations. See \u201cBusiness\u2009\u2014\u2009Environmental, Health and Safety.\u201d We cannot \n37\n\n\nTable of Contents\nassure you that our operations or activities or those of certain of our subsidiaries, including with respect to compliance with Environmental Laws, will not result in civil or criminal enforcement actions or private actions, regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures or costs, revocation of required Environmental Permits, or fines, penalties or damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict the extent to which Environmental Laws, and the interpretation or enforcement thereof, may change or become more stringent in the future, each of which may affect the market for our products or give rise to additional capital expenditures, compliance costs or liabilities that could be material.\nOur operations or products may impact the environment or cause or contribute to contamination or exposure to hazardous substances.\nGiven the nature of our current and former operations, particularly at our chemical manufacturing sites, we have incurred, are currently incurring and may in the future incur liabilities under CERCLA, or under other federal, state, local and foreign Environmental Laws related to releases of or contamination by hazardous substances, with respect to our current or former sites, adjacent or nearby third-party sites, or offsite disposal locations. See \u201cBusiness\u2009\u2014\u2009Environmental, Health and Safety.\u201d Certain Environmental Laws, including CERCLA, can impose strict, joint, several and retroactive liability for the cost of investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites on owners and operators of such sites, as well as on persons who dispose of or arrange for disposal of hazardous substances at such sites. Accordingly, we could incur liability, whether as a result of government enforcement or private claims, for known or unknown liabilities at, or caused by migration from or hazardous waste transported from, any of our current or former facilities or properties, including those owned or operated by predecessors or third parties. See \u201cBusiness\u00a0\u2014 Environmental, Health and Safety.\u201d Such liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe nature of our current and former operations also exposes us to the risk of claims under Environmental Laws. We could be subject to claims by environmental regulatory authorities, individuals and other third parties seeking damages for alleged personal injury, property damage and damages to natural resources resulting from hazardous substance contamination or human exposure caused by our operations, facilities or products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims. Our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any of these exposures, product, injury or damage claims.\nFurthermore, regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment. This increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns for both new and existing products and could affect product sales and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have been and \nmay continue to be subject to claims of injury from direct exposure to certain of our products that constitute or contain hazardous substances and from indirect exposure when such substances are incorporated into other companies\u2019 products\n.\nBecause certain of our products constitute or contain hazardous substances, and because the production of certain chemicals involves the use, handling, processing, storage and transportation of hazardous substances, from time to time we are subject to claims of injury from direct exposure to such substances and from indirect exposure when such substances are incorporated into other companies\u2019 products. There can be no assurance that as a result of past or future operations, there will not be additional claims of injury by employees or members of the public due to exposure, or alleged exposure, to such substances. We are also party to a number of claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business, including product liability claims and allegations of violations of governmental regulations, and face present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure, workers\u2019 compensation and other matters. In most cases, such claims are covered by insurance and, where applicable, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, subject to policy limits and exclusions; however, our insurance coverage, to the extent available, may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture, sale and use of our products. Insurance is expensive and, in the future, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. A successful claim or series of claims brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition \n38\n\n\nTable of Contents\nand results of operations. In addition, any claims, even if not ultimately successful, could adversely affect the marketplace\u2019s acceptance of our products.\nWe are subject to risks from litigation that may materially impact our operations.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims and lawsuits. We are involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of every pending claim or lawsuit or the range of probable loss, we believe these pending lawsuits and claims will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. However, we could, in the future, be subject to various lawsuits, including intellectual property, product liability, personal injury, product warranty, environmental or antitrust claims, among others, and incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.\nWe are subject to risks that may not be covered by our insurance policies.\nIn addition to pollution and other environmental risks, we are subject to risks inherent in the animal health, mineral nutrition and performance products industries, such as explosions, fires, spills or releases. Any significant interruption of operations at our principal facilities could have a material adverse effect on us. We maintain general liability insurance, pollution legal liability insurance and property and business interruption insurance with coverage limits that we believe are adequate. Because of the nature of industry hazards, it is possible that liabilities for pollution and other damages arising from a major occurrence may not be covered by our insurance policies or could exceed insurance coverages or policy limits or that such insurance may not be available at reasonable rates in the future. Any such liabilities, which could arise due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage or suspension of operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdverse U.S. and international economic and market conditions may adversely affect our product sales and business.\nCurrent U.S. and international economic and market conditions are uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected international economic conditions and financial markets and led to economic downturns in many countries in which we operate. Our revenues and operating results may be affected by uncertain or changing economic and market conditions, including as a result of a resurgence of COVID-19 pandemic or other similar public health crises, and other challenges faced in the credit markets and financial services industry. \nEconomic, business, political and financial disruptions from the ongoing armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the imposition of sanctions and business disruptions as well as inflation, could also have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity. Certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from customers. Customers may seek lower price alternatives to our products if they are negatively impacted by poor economic conditions. Furthermore, our exposure to credit and collectability risk and cybersecurity risk is higher in certain international markets and as a result of the crisis resulting from the ongoing armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, our ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit and collectability risk and we have defensive measures in place to prevent and mitigate cyberattacks, there can be no assurance that such procedures and measures will effectively limit such risks and avoid losses. \nIf domestic and global economic and market conditions remain uncertain or persist or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse economic conditions impacting our customers, including, among others, increased taxation, higher unemployment, lower customer confidence in the economy, higher customer debt levels, lower availability of customer credit, higher interest rates and hardships relating to declines in the stock markets, could cause purchases of meat products to decline, resulting in a decrease in purchases of our products, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation. Adverse economic and market conditions could also negatively impact our business by negatively affecting the parties with whom we do business, including among others, our customers, our manufacturers and our suppliers.\n39\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets.\nWe have been taking steps to take advantage of the rise in global demand for animal protein in emerging markets, including by expanding our manufacturing presence, sales, marketing and distribution in these markets. Failure to continue to maintain and expand our business in emerging markets could also materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nSome countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of local, regional or global economic, political or social instability or crisis. For example, our sales in certain emerging markets have suffered from extended periods of disruption due to natural disasters. Furthermore, we have also experienced lower than expected sales in certain emerging markets due to local, regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in those countries. For all these and other reasons, sales within emerging markets carry significant risks.\nModification of foreign trade policy may harm our food animal product customers.\nChanges in laws, agreements and policies governing foreign trade in the territories and countries where our customers do business could negatively impact such customers\u2019 businesses and adversely affect our results of operations. A number of our customers, particularly U.S.-based food animal producers have benefited from free trade agreements, including, in the past, the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d). The U.S., Canada and Mexico reached an agreement to replace NAFTA with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Any other changes to international trade agreements or policies could harm our customers, and as a result, negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in response to new U.S. tariffs affecting foreign imports, some foreign governments, including China, have instituted or are considering instituting tariffs on certain U.S. goods. While the scope and duration of these and any future tariffs remain uncertain, tariffs imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments on our customers\u2019 products, or on our products or the active pharmaceutical ingredients or other components thereof, could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur product approval, R&D, acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products and product lifecycle developments.\nOur future success depends on both our existing product portfolio, including our ability to obtain cross-clearances enabling the use of our medicated products in conjunction with other products, approval for use of our products with new species, approval for new claims for our products, approval of our products in new markets and our pipeline of new products, including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition. The majority of our R&D programs focus on product lifecycle development, which is defined as R&D programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims, achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations. We commit substantial effort, funds and other resources to expanding our product approvals and R&D, both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties.\nWe may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our expanded product approvals for our existing product portfolio or any of our products now under development will be approved or launched, or we may be unable to obtain expanded product approvals or develop, license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products. In addition, we cannot predict whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenues that are consistent with our expectations. The animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and, as a result, products that are successful in some of our markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into new markets. Furthermore, the timing and cost of our R&D may increase, and our R&D may become less predictable. For example, changes in regulations applicable to our industry may make it more time-consuming and/or costly to research, test and develop products.\nProducts in the animal health industry are sometimes derived from molecules and compounds discovered or developed as part of human health research. We may enter into collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties to provide us with access to compounds and other technology for purposes of our business. Such agreements are typically complex and require time to negotiate and implement. If we enter into these arrangements, we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, any collaboration that we enter into may not be successful, and the success may depend on the efforts and actions of our \n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncollaborators, which we may not be able to control. If we are unable to access human health-generated molecules and compounds to conduct R&D on cost-effective terms, our ability to develop new products could be limited.\nThe actual or purported intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business.\nA third party may sue us, our distributors or licensors, or otherwise make a claim, alleging infringement or other violation of the third-party\u2019s patents, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, domain names or other intellectual property rights. If we do not prevail in this type of litigation, we may be required to:\n\u25cf\npay monetary damages;\n\u25cf\nobtain a license in order to continue manufacturing or marketing the affected products, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or\n\u25cf\nstop activities, including any commercial activities, relating to the affected products, which could include a recall of the affected products and/or a cessation of sales in the future.\nThe costs of defending an intellectual property claim could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, even if we successfully defend such claims. We may also incur costs in connection with an obligation to indemnify a distributor, licensor or other third party. Moreover, even if we believe that we do not infringe a validly existing third-party patent, we may choose to license such patent, which would result in associated costs and obligations. \nThe intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions, and an issued patent does not guarantee us the right to practice the patented technology or develop, manufacture or commercialize the patented product. We cannot be certain that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that may prevent us from manufacturing, developing or marketing certain of our products, regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable or we believe we would be otherwise able to develop a more commercially successful product, which may harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented, competitors may be able to take advantage of our R&D efforts. We are also dependent upon trade secrets, which in some cases may be difficult to protect.\nOur long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property, including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours. Our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, or be approved on a timely basis, or at all. Similarly, any term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area. The scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have their own patent laws. For example, some countries only permit the issuance of patents covering a novel chemical compound itself, and its first use, and thus further methods of use for the same compound, may not be patentable. We may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property, including claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term. The validity, enforceability, scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings. Our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country\u2019s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, including because such agreements expire or are terminated, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nPatent law changes in the United States and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights or make such enforcement financially unattractive. Any such changes could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property or limit our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products in these jurisdictions. \n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nLikewise, in the United States and other countries, we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same and thus create the potential need to rebrand or relabel a product. As our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result, if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur competitive position is also dependent upon unpatented trade secrets, which in some cases may be difficult to protect. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and trade secrets may be disclosed or we may not be able to protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets.\nMany of our vaccine products and other products are based on or incorporate proprietary information, including proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations. We actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment, engagement or other relationship. Despite these efforts and precautions, we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.\nThe misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States, may occur even when we take steps to prevent it. In the future, we may be party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming, and if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business and financial condition. In the future, we may not be able to enforce intellectual property that relates to our products for various reasons, including licensor restrictions and other restrictions imposed by third parties, and the costs of doing so may outweigh the value of doing so, and this could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws or trade control laws, as well as other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations\n.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business. The FCPA, UK Bribery Act and other laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations, and we participate in relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control and various non-U.S. government entities, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements, currency exchange regulations and transfer pricing regulations (collectively, the \u201cTrade Control laws\u201d).\nThere is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anticorruption laws, including the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil \n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\npenalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased regulation or decreased governmental financial support for the raising, processing or consumption of food animals could reduce demand for our animal health products.\nCompanies in the animal health industry are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations. If livestock producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to existing regulations, they may reduce herd sizes or become less profitable and, as a result, they may reduce their use of our products, which may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, adverse regulations related, directly or indirectly, to the use of one or more of our products may injure livestock producers\u2019 market position. More stringent regulation of the livestock industry or our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Also, many industrial producers, including livestock producers, benefit from governmental subsidies, and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated, these companies may become less profitable and, as a result, may reduce their use of our products.\nIncreased or decreased inventory levels at our channel distributors can lead to fluctuations in our revenues and variations in payment terms extended to our distributors can impact our cash flows.\n       In addition to selling our products directly to customers, we also sell to distributors who, in turn, sell our products to third parties. Inventory levels at our distributors may increase or decrease as a result of various factors, including end customer demand, new customer contracts, the influence of competition, political and socio-economic climate, contractual obligations related to minimum inventory levels, changing perceptions, including those of alternative products, our ability to renew distribution contracts with expected terms, our ability to implement commercial strategies, regulatory restrictions, armed conflicts, unexpected customer behavior, proactive measures taken by us in response to shifting market dynamics and procedures and environmental factors beyond our control, including weather conditions or an outbreak of infectious disease such as COVID-19 or diseases carried by farm animals such as African Swine fever. These increases and decreases can lead to variations in our quarterly and annual revenues.\n       In addition, we have policies that govern the payment terms that we extend to our customers. From time to time, our distributors have requested exceptions to the payment term policies that we extend to them for various reasons, including consolidation amongst our distributors, changes in the buying patterns of end customers, as well as the perception of our distributors regarding the need to maintain certain inventory levels to avoid supply disruptions. Extensions of anticipated customer payment terms can impact our cash flows, liquidity and results of operations.       \nWe have substantial debt \nand interest payment requirements that may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our obligations under our indebtedness. Restrictions imposed by our outstanding indebtedness, including the restrictions contained in our 2021 Credit Facilities, may limit our ability to operate our business and to finance our future operations or capital\n needs or to engage in other business activities.\nAs of June\u00a030,\u00a02023, we had outstanding indebtedness (reflecting the principal amounts) of $273.8 million under our 2021 Term A loan (as defined below), $50.0 million under our 2023 Incremental Term loan (as defined below), $141.0\u00a0million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $11.7 million under our 2022 Term Loan (as defined below) and $2.5\u00a0million of outstanding letters of credit. Subject to restrictions in our 2021 Credit Facilities (as defined below), we may incur significant additional indebtedness. If we and our subsidiaries incur significant additional indebtedness, the related risks that we face could intensify.\nOur substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:\n\u25cf\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the 2021 Credit Facilities;\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which will reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nlimit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared with some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources; and\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.\nOur ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow, and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds, to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy.\nThe terms of the 2021 Credit Facilities contain certain covenants that limit our ability and that of our subsidiaries to create liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, incur indebtedness and guarantees, repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness, make certain investments or acquisitions, enter into certain transactions with affiliates or change the nature of our business. As a result of these covenants and restrictions, we will be limited in how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We may not be able to maintain compliance with the covenants in any of our debt instruments in the future and, if we fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the related economic downturn in the debt markets. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to dispose of material assets or operations, alter our dividend policy, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The instruments that govern our indebtedness may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due.\nIn addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries, including our international subsidiaries, and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances, legal, tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries or may subject any transfer of cash from our subsidiaries to substantial tax liabilities. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe are subject to change of control provisions.\nWe are a party to certain contractual arrangements that are subject to change of control provisions. In this context, \u201cchange of control\u201d is generally defined as including (a)\u00a0any person or group, other than Mr.\u00a0Jack\u00a0C. Bendheim and his family and affiliates (the current holders of approximately 90.9% of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding common stock), becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power of our stock, and (b)\u00a0a change in any twelve month period in the majority of the members of the Board that is not approved by Mr.\u00a0Bendheim and/or his family and affiliates or by the majority of directors in office at the start of such period.\nMr.\u00a0Bendheim and his family and affiliates may choose to dispose of part or all of their stakes in us and/or may cease to exercise the current level of control they have over the appointment and removal of members of our Board. Any such changes may trigger a \u201cchange of control\u201d event that could result in us being forced to repay the 2021 Credit Facilities (which includes our 2023 Incremental Term Loan) or lead to the termination of a significant contract to which we are a party. If any such event occurs, this may negatively affect our financial condition and operating results. In addition, we may not have sufficient funds to finance repayment of any of such indebtedness upon any such \u201cchange in control.\u201d\nWe depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure.\nWe rely on various information systems to manage our operations, and we increasingly depend on third parties and applications on virtualized, or \u201ccloud,\u201d infrastructure to operate and support our information technology systems. These third parties include large established vendors as well as small, privately owned companies. Failure by these providers to adequately service our operations or a change in control or insolvency of these providers could have an adverse effect on our business, which in turn may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired, we will be required to write down these assets and record a non-cash impairment charge. As of June\u00a030,\u00a02023, we had goodwill of\u2009$53.3\u00a0million and identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization, of $55.0\u00a0million. Identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology rights and patents and customer relationships.\nDetermining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment. Future events or new information may change management\u2019s valuation of goodwill or an intangible asset in a short amount of time. The timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our consolidated statements of operations and write-downs recorded in our consolidated balance sheets could vary if management\u2019s conclusions change. Any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our customers\u2019 privacy or we may fail to comply with privacy laws.\nThe protection of customer, employee and company data is critical and the regulatory environment surrounding information security, storage, use, processing, disclosure and privacy is demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. In addition, our customers expect that we will adequately protect their personal information. Any actual or perceived significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, cyber-attack or corruption of customer, employee or company data or our failure to comply with federal, state, local and foreign privacy laws could damage our reputation and result in lost sales, fines and lawsuits. Despite our considerable efforts and technology to secure our computer network, security could be compromised, confidential information could be misappropriated or system disruptions could occur. Any actual or perceived access, disclosure or other loss of information or any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, cyber-attack or corruption of customer, employee or company data or our failure to comply with federal, state, local and foreign privacy laws or contractual obligations with customers, vendors, payment processors and other \n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nthird parties, could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws or contracts that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption of our operations and damage to our reputation, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, revenue and competitive position.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to conduct critical operations and generally operate our business, which includes using information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations, including customer, employee and company data. The COVID-19 pandemic and related quarantines, shelter-in-place and \u201csocial distancing\u201d requirements, travel restrictions and other similar government orders, have resulted in a substantial portion of our employees working remotely and have increased our dependence on tools that facilitate employees working from home and gaining remote access to our information technology systems. As a result, any disruption to our information technology systems, our industrial machinery, software used in our manufacturing facilities, firmware or software embedded in our equipment or machinery, including from cyber incidents, could have a material adverse effect on our business. The increased use of these tools could also make our information technology systems more vulnerable to breaches of data security and cybersecurity attacks. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack. We also store certain information with third parties. Our information systems and those of our third-party vendors are subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber, phishing or ransomware attacks and also are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks and external hazards. Disruption, degradation, or manipulation of these systems and infrastructure through intentional or accidental means could impact key business processes. Cyber-attacks against the Company\u2019s systems and infrastructure could result in exposure of confidential information, the modification of critical data and/or the failure of critical operations. Likewise, improper or inadvertent employee behavior, including data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Any such breach could compromise our networks, and the information stored therein could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Such attacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being lost or stolen, disruption of our operations and other negative consequences, such as increased costs for security measures or remediation costs, and diversion of management attention. Although the aggregate impact on the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition has not been material to date, the Company has been the target of events of this nature and expects them to continue as cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. The Company monitors its data, information technology and personnel usage of Company systems to reduce these risks and continues to do so on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. \nIf any of our operational technologies, software or hardware or other control systems are compromised, fail or have other significant shortcomings, it could disrupt our business, require us to incur substantial additional expenses or result in potential liability or reputational damage. While we have invested in protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent such breakdowns, cybersecurity attacks or breaches in our systems that could cause reputational damage, business disruption and legal and regulatory costs; could result in third-party claims; could result in compromise or misappropriation of our intellectual property, trade secrets and sensitive information; and could otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. \nImplementing new business lines or offering new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\n       From time to time, we may implement new business lines or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There may be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. We may invest significant time and resources in developing, marketing, or acquiring new lines of business and/or offering new products and services. Initial timetables for the introduction and development or acquisition of new lines of business and/or the offering of new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may prove to be unachievable. Our lack of experience or knowledge, as well as external factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the success of an acquisition or the implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. New business lines or new products and services within existing lines of business could affect the sales and profitability of existing lines of business or products and services. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the implementation or acquisition of new lines of business or the offering of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n46\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class\u00a0A Common Stock\nOur multiple class structure and the concentration of our voting power with certain of our stockholders will limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and conflicts of interest between certain of our stockholders and us or other investors could arise in the future\n.\nAs of August\u00a025, 2023, BFI Co., LLC (\u201cBFI\u201d) beneficially owns 59,480 shares of our Class\u00a0A common stock and 20,166,034 shares of our Class\u00a0B common stock, which together represent approximately 90.9% of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding common stock. As of August\u00a025, 2023, our other stockholders collectively own interests representing approximately 9.1% of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding common stock. Because of our multiple class structure and the concentration of voting power with BFI, BFI will continue to be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval for so long as BFI holds common stock representing greater than 50% of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding common stock. BFI will therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and control the approval of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of the Company or its assets, for the foreseeable future.\nWe are classified as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and, as a result, we qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements\n.\nBFI controls a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under Nasdaq rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u25cf\nthe requirement that a majority of the Board consists of independent directors;\n\u25cf\nthe requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee and that it is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u25cf\nthe requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nWe utilize and intend to continue to utilize these exemptions. As a result, while we currently have a majority of independent directors:\n\u25cf\nwe may not have a majority of independent directors in the future;\n\u25cf\nwe will not have a nominating and corporate governance committee; and\n\u25cf\nwe will not be required to have an annual performance evaluation of the compensation committee.\nAccordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price of our Class\u00a0A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including those described under \u201c\u2014 Risk Factors Relating to Our Business\u201d and the following:\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our Class\u00a0A common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our Class\u00a0A common stock;\n\u25cf\ndowngrades by any securities analysts who follow our Class\u00a0A common stock;\n\u25cf\nfuture sales of our Class\u00a0A common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n47\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nmarket conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole and, in particular, in the animal health industry;\n\u25cf\ninvestors\u2019 perceptions of our prospects;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures or capital commitments; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in key personnel.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. The COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine has contributed to significant volatility in stock and financial markets in the United States and globally. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nOur majority stockholder has the ability to control significant corporate activities and our majority stockholder\u2019s interests may not coincide with yours.\nAs of August\u00a025, 2023, approximately 90.9% of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding common stock is held by BFI. As a result of its ownership, so long as it holds a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding common stock, BFI will have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and, through our Board of Directors, the ability to control decision-making with respect to our business direction and policies. Matters over which BFI, directly or indirectly, exercises control include:\n\u25cf\nthe election of our Board of Directors and the appointment and removal of our officers;\n\u25cf\nmergers and other business combination transactions, including proposed transactions that would result in our stockholders receiving a premium price for their shares;\n\u25cf\nother acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets;\n\u25cf\nincurrence of indebtedness and the issuance of equity securities;\n\u25cf\nrepurchase of stock and payment of dividends; and\n\u25cf\nthe issuance of shares to management under our equity incentive plans.\nEven if BFI\u2019s ownership of our shares falls below a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding common stock, it may continue to be able to influence or effectively control our decisions.\nFuture sales of our Class\u00a0A common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class\u00a0A common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our Class\u00a0A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. In addition, subject to certain restrictions on converting Class\u00a0B common stock into Class\u00a0A common stock, all of our outstanding shares of Class\u00a0B common stock may be converted into Class\u00a0A common stock and sold in the public market by existing stockholders. As of August\u00a025, 2023, we had 20,337,574 shares of Class\u00a0A common stock and 20,166,034 shares of Class\u00a0B common stock outstanding.\nBFI, which holds all of our outstanding Class\u00a0B common stock, has the right to require us to register the sales of their shares under the Securities Act under the terms of an agreement between us and the holders of these securities. In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our Class\u00a0A common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our Class\u00a0A common stock.\n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the Company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions:\n\u25cf\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of Class\u00a0A common stock;\n\u25cf\nprohibit, at any time after BFI and its affiliates cease to hold at least 50% of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding common stock, stockholder action by written consent, without the express prior consent of the Board of Directors;\n\u25cf\nprovide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u25cf\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u25cf\nestablish a classified Board of Directors, as a result of which our Board of Directors will be divided into three classes, with each class serving for staggered three-year terms, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new Board of Directors at an annual meeting; and require, at any time after BFI and its affiliates cease to hold at least 50% of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding common stock, the approval of holders of at least three quarters of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding common stock for stockholders to amend the amended and restated bylaws or amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees\n.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i)\u00a0any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii)\u00a0any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii)\u00a0any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our by-laws or (iv)\u00a0any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation could have the effect of preventing us from having the benefit of certain business opportunities that we would otherwise be entitled to pursue.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that BFI and its affiliates are not required to offer corporate opportunities of which they become aware to us and could, therefore, offer such opportunities instead to other companies including affiliates of BFI. In the event that BFI obtains business opportunities from which we might otherwise benefit but chooses not to present such opportunities to us, these provisions of our certificate of incorporation could have the effect of \n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\npreventing us from pursuing transactions or relationships that would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe may not pay cash dividends in the future and, as a result, you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your Class\u00a0A common stock for a price greater than your initial investment.\nWe have a paid a quarterly dividend since September\u00a02014 on our Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B common stock and our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of\u2009$0.12 per share on our Class\u00a0A common stock and Class\u00a0B common stock that is payable September 27, 2023. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions and our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. Our 2021 Credit Facilities permit us to pay distributions to stockholders out of available cash subject to certain annual limitations and so long as no default or event of default under the 2021 Credit Facilities shall have occurred and be continuing at the time such distribution is declared. Realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our Class\u00a0A common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe face competition in each of our markets from a number of large and small companies, some of which have greater financial, R&D, production and other resources than we have. \nMany of our products face competition from alternative or substitute products. We are engaged in highly competitive industries and, with respect to all of our major products, face competition from a substantial number of global and regional competitors. Several new start-up companies also compete in the animal health industry. We believe many of our competitors are conducting R&D activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products. Some competitors have greater financial, R&D, production and other resources than we have. Some of our principal competitors include Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Ceva Sant\u00e9 Animale, Elanco Animal Health Incorporated, Huvepharma Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck Animal Health and MSD Animal Health), Southeastern Minerals, Inc. and Zoetis Inc. To the extent these companies or new entrants offer comparable animal health, mineral nutrition or performance products at lower prices, our business could be adversely affected. New entrants could substantially reduce our market share or render our products obsolete. Furthermore, many of our competitors have relationships with key distributors and, because of their size, have the ability to offer attractive pricing incentives, which may negatively impact or hinder our relationships with these distributors. \nIn certain countries, because of our size and product mix, we may not be able to capitalize on changes in competition and pricing as fully as our competitors. In recent years, there have been new generic medicated products introduced to the livestock industry, particularly in the United States. \nThere has been and likely will continue to be consolidation in the animal health market, which could strengthen our competitors. Our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the formulation and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to maintain our current competitive position or market share. We also face competitive pressures arising from, among other things, more favorable safety and efficacy product profiles, limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products being introduced into a particular market, price reductions by competitors, the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale and the ability of competitors to produce or otherwise procure animal health products at lower costs than us. To the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, or we are forced to reduce, or are unable to raise, the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. \nFailure to comply with requirements to design, implement and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. \nAs a public company, we have significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. If we are unable to establish or maintain appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail \n50\n\n\nTable of Contents\nto meet our reporting obligations on a timely basis, result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and harm our operating results. In addition, we are required, pursuant to Section 404, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting and a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal controls. Testing and maintaining internal controls may divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to our business. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 or our independent registered public accounting firm may not issue an unqualified opinion. We cannot provide any assurance we will not identify material weaknesses in the future. If we suffer deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to report financial information in a timely and accurate manner and it could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reporting, negatively affect the trading price of our common stock and could cause a default under the agreements governing our indebtedness. If either we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified opinion, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our stock. \nAs a public company, we are subject to financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy and may divert management\u2019s attention from our business. \nAs a public company, we are required to file annual and quarterly reports and other information pursuant to the Exchange Act with the SEC. We are required to ensure that we have the ability to prepare consolidated financial statements that comply with SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. We are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including the applicable stock exchange listing standards and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose significant compliance obligations upon us. \nAs a public company, we are required to commit significant resources and management time and attention to these requirements, which cause us to incur significant costs and which may place a strain on our systems and resources. As a result, our management\u2019s attention might be diverted from other business concerns. Compliance with these requirements place significant demands on our legal, accounting and finance staff and on our accounting, financial and information systems and increase our legal and accounting compliance costs as well as our compensation expense as we have been or may be required to hire additional accounting, tax, finance and legal staff with the requisite technical knowledge. \nWe may not be able to expand through acquisitions or successfully integrate the products, services and personnel of acquired businesses. \nFrom time to time, we may make selective acquisitions to expand our range of products and services and to expand the geographic scope of our business. However, we may be unable to identify suitable targets, and competition for acquisitions may make it difficult for us to consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms or at all. We may not be able to locate any complementary products that meet our requirements or that are available to us on acceptable terms or we may not have sufficient capital resources to consummate a proposed acquisition. In addition, assuming we identify suitable products or partners, the process of effectively entering into these arrangements involves risks that our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns. Further, if we succeed in identifying and consummating appropriate acquisitions on acceptable terms, we may not be able to successfully integrate the products, services and personnel of any acquired businesses on a basis consistent with our current business practice. In particular, we may face greater than expected costs, time and effort involved in completing and integrating acquisitions and potential disruption of our ongoing business. Furthermore, we may realize fewer, if any, synergies than envisaged. Our ability to manage acquired businesses may also be limited if we enter into joint ventures or do not acquire full ownership or a controlling stake in the acquired business. In addition, continued growth through acquisitions may significantly strain our existing management and operational resources. As a result, we may need to recruit additional personnel, particularly at the level below senior management, and we may not be able to recruit qualified management and other key personnel to manage our growth. Moreover, certain transactions could adversely impact earnings as we incur development and other expenses related to the transactions and we could incur debt to complete these transactions. Debt instruments could contain \n51\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncontractual commitments and covenants that could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nWe may not successfully implement our business strategies or achieve expected gross margin improvements. \nWe are pursuing and may continue to pursue strategic initiatives that management considers critical to our long-term success, including, but not limited to, increasing sales in emerging markets, base revenue growth through new product development and value-added product lifecycle development; improving operational efficiency through manufacturing efficiency improvement and other programs; and expanding our complementary products and services. There are significant risks involved with the execution of these types of initiatives, including significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether we will succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives. It could take several years to realize the anticipated benefits from these initiatives, if any benefits are achieved at all. We may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements on our products or technologies. Additionally, our business strategy may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business.\n\u200b",
    "item7": ">Item\u00a07.Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nOur management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) is provided to assist readers in understanding our performance, as reflected in the results of our operations, our financial condition and our cash flows. The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included under the section entitled \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Our future results could differ materially from our historical performance as a result of various factors such as those discussed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cForward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors Summary.\u201d\nOverview of our business\nPhibro Animal Health Corporation is a leading global diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company. We develop, manufacture and market a broad range of products for food and companion animals including poultry, swine, beef and dairy cattle, aquaculture and dogs. Our products help prevent, control and treat diseases, and support nutrition to help improve animal health and well-being. In addition to animal health and mineral nutrition products, we manufacture and market specific ingredients for use in the personal care, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. We market approximately 770 product lines in over 80 countries to approximately 4,000 customers.\n55\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFactors affecting our performance\nArmed conflict between Russia and Ukraine\nIn response to the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in February 2022, we and our employees have provided support to Ukraine in the form of monetary donations, free products and humanitarian services. Our limited intent for the Russian market is to continue to provide medicines and vaccines, and related regulatory and technical support, to help existing customers combat disease challenges in the production of food animals on their farms. We have no production or direct distribution operations and no planned investments in Russia.\nSince the conflict began, the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (\u201cNATO\u201d) member states, as well as non-member states, announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia, including certain Russian citizens and enterprises. The continuation or escalation of the conflict may trigger additional economic and other sanctions, as well as broader military conflict. The potential impacts of any resulting bans, sanctions, boycotts or broader military conflicts on our business are uncertain. The potential impacts could include supply chain and logistics disruptions, macroeconomic impacts resulting from the exclusion of Russian financial institutions from the global banking system, volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, inflationary pressures on raw materials and energy as well as heightened cybersecurity threats. Our annual sales to Russia and Ukraine represent approximately 1% of consolidated net sales.\nWe cannot know if the conflict could escalate and result in broader economic and security concerns that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. \nIndustry growth\nWe believe global population growth, the growth of the global middle class and the productivity improvements needed due to limitations of arable land and water supplies have supported and will continue to support growth of the animal health industry.\nRegulatory developments\nOur business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry. Some in the public perceive risks to human health related to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize certain of our products, including certain of our MFA products. In particular, there is increased focus, in the United States and other countries, on the use of medically important antimicrobials. As defined by the FDA, medically important antimicrobials (\u201cMIAs\u201d) include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health and are listed in the Appendix of the FDA-CVM Guidance for Industry (GFI) 152. Our products that contain virginiamycin, oxytetracycline or neomycin are classified by the FDA as medically important antimicrobials. In addition to the United States, the World Health Organization (WHO), the E.U., Australia and Canada have promulgated rating lists for antimicrobials that are used in veterinary medicine and that include certain of our products.\nThe classification of our products as MIAs or similar listings may lead to a decline in the demand for and production of food products derived from animals that utilize our products and, in turn, demand for our products. Livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of nutrition and health-related concerns, animal rights and other concerns. Any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries, including us. In addition, campaigns by interest groups, activists and others with respect to perceived risks associated with the use of our products in animals, including position statements by livestock producers and their customers based on non-use of certain medicated products in livestock production, whether or not scientifically-supported, could affect public perceptions and reduce the use of our products. Those adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in animals could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn April 2016, the FDA began initial steps to withdraw approval of carbadox (the active ingredient in our Mecadox product) via a regulatory process known as a NOOH, due to concerns that certain residues from the product may persist in animal tissues for longer than previously determined. In the years following, Phibro has continued an ongoing process of responding collaboratively and transparently to the CVM inquiries and has provided extensive and meticulous research and data that confirmed the safety of carbadox. In July 2020, the FDA announced it would not proceed to a hearing on the scientific concerns raised in the 2016 NOOH, consistent with the normal regulatory procedure, but instead announced that it was withdrawing the 2016 NOOH and issuing a proposed order to review the regulatory method for carbadox. Phibro reiterated the safety of carbadox and the appropriateness of the regulatory method and offered to work \n56\n\n\nTable of Contents\nwith the CVM to generate additional data to support the existing regulatory method or select a suitable alternative regulatory method. \nIn March 2022, the FDA held a Part 15 virtual public hearing seeking data and information related to the safety of carbadox in which Phibro participated and again detailed the extensive research and data that confirm the safety of carbadox. In the event the FDA continues to assert that carbadox should be removed from the market, we will argue that we are entitled to and expect to have a full evidentiary hearing on the merits before an administrative law judge. Should we be unable to successfully defend the safety of the product, the loss of carbadox sales will have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Sales of Mecadox (carbadox) for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, were approximately $20 million. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Mecadox continues to be available for use by swine producers.\nSee also \u201cBusiness\u2009\u2014\u2009\n \nCompliance with Government Regulation \u2009\u2014\u2009United States \u2014\u2009Carbadox\u201d; and \u201cBusiness \u2014 Compliance with Government Regulation \u2014 Global Policy and Guidance.\u201d\nOur global sales of antibacterials, anticoccidials and other products were $387 million, $361 million and $330 million for the years ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCompetition\nThe animal health industry is highly competitive. We believe many of our competitors are conducting R&D activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products. Our competitors include specialty animal health businesses and the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies. In addition to competition from established participants, there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry in the future. Principal methods of competition vary depending on the region, species, product category or individual products, including reliability, reputation, quality, price, service and promotion to veterinary professionals and livestock producers. \nForeign exchange\nWe conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. For the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, we generated approximately 40% of our revenues from operations outside the United States. Although a portion of our revenues are denominated in various currencies, the selling prices of the majority of our sales outside the United States are referenced in U.S. dollars, and as a result, our revenues have not been significantly affected by currency movements. We are subject to currency risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. We manufacture some of our major products in Brazil and Israel and production costs are largely denominated in local currencies, while the selling prices of the products are largely set in U.S. dollars. As such, we are exposed to changes in cost of goods sold resulting from currency movements and may not be able to adjust our selling prices to offset such movements. In addition, we incur selling and administrative expenses in various currencies and are exposed to changes in such expenses resulting from currency movements. For the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, our expenses were not significantly affected by currency movements. Because our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations.\nClimate\nAdverse weather events and natural disasters may interfere with and negatively impact operations at our manufacturing sites, research and development facilities and offices, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, especially if the impact of an event or disaster is frequent or prolonged.\nOur operations, and the activities of our customers, could be disrupted by climate change. The physical changes caused by climate change may prompt changes in regulations or consumer preferences which in turn could have negative consequences for our and our customers\u2019 businesses. Climate change may negatively impact our customers\u2019 operations, particularly those in the livestock industry, through climate-related impacts such as increased air and water temperatures, rising water levels and increased incidence of disease in livestock. Potential physical risks from climate change may include altered distribution and intensity of rainfall, prolonged droughts or flooding, increased frequency of wildfires and other natural disasters, rising sea levels and a rising heat index, any of which could cause negative impacts to our and our customers\u2019 businesses. If such events affect our customers\u2019 businesses, they may purchase fewer of our products, and \n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nour revenues may be negatively impacted. Climate driven changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \nThere has been a broad range of proposed and promulgated state, national and international regulations aimed at reducing the effects of climate change. Such regulations could result in additional costs to maintain compliance and additional income or other taxes. Climate change regulations continue to evolve, and it is not possible to accurately estimate potential future compliance costs.\nProduct development initiatives\nOur future success depends on our existing product portfolio, including additional approvals for new claims for our products, for use of our products in new markets, for use of our products with new species and for cross-clearances enabling the use of our medicated products in conjunction with other products. Our future success also depends on our pipeline of new products, including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition. The majority of our R&D programs focus on product lifecycle development, which is defined as R&D programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims, achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations. We commit substantial effort, funds and other resources to expanding our product approvals and R&D, both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties. We also commit significant resources to development of new vaccine technologies.\nOur current strategic initiatives include several projects. We are working to develop a vaccine for African Swine Fever, a virulent disease that is highly lethal in swine. We have also developed pHi-Tech, a portable electronic vaccination device and software that ensures proper delivery of vaccines and provides health management information. We continue to invest in a vaccine production facility in Sligo, Ireland to manufacture poultry vaccines, with our first commercial sale of product realized in 2022, and longer-term expectations to add swine and cattle vaccines. We are developing microbial products and bioproducts for a variety of applications serving animal health and nutrition, environmental, industrial and agricultural customers. We began operations at a new vaccine production facility in Guarulhos, Brazil that manufactures and markets autogenous vaccines against animal diseases for swine, poultry and aquaculture. We continue to build our companion animal business and pipeline. Our Rejensa joint supplement for dogs continues to gain customer acceptance. Our companion animal development pipeline includes an early-stage atopic dermatitis compound, a novel Lyme vaccine delivery system product, a potential treatment for mitral heart valve disease in dogs, a pain product and two early-stage oral care compounds.\n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAnalysis of the consolidated statements of operations\nSummary Results of

prices. Although a portion of our net sales is denominated in various currencies, the selling prices of the majority of our sales outside the United States are referenced in U.S. dollars, and as a result, currency movements have not significantly affected our revenues.\nOur effective income tax rate has varied from period to period and from the federal statutory rate, due to the mix of taxable profits in various jurisdictions; changes in tax rates from period to period, including changes in income tax legislation in the United States and various international jurisdictions; and the effects of changes in uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances. Our future effective income tax rate will vary due to the relative amounts of taxable income in various jurisdictions, future changes in tax rates and legislation and other factors. We intend to continue to reinvest indefinitely the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we could be subject to applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes if amounts are repatriated to the U.S. See \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u2009\u2014\u2009Income Taxes\u201d for additional information.\n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNet sales, Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation of GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA\nWe report Net sales and Adjusted EBITDA by segment to understand the operating performance of each segment.

sales of $977.9 million for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, increased $35.6 million, or 4%, as compared to the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02022. Animal Health sales increased $52.8 million. Mineral Nutrition and Performance Products sales decreased by $16.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nAnimal Health\nNet sales of $659.9 million for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, increased $52.8 million, or 9%. Net sales of MFAs and other increased $25.8 million, or 7%, due to increased demand for our MFAs, particularly in the U.S. and Latin America regions, and for processing aids used in the ethanol fermentation industry. Net sales of nutritional specialty products grew $15.3 million, or 10%, due to strong demand in dairy products and increased sales of Rejensa\n\u00ae\n, our companion animal product. Net sales of vaccines increased $11.7 million, or 13%, with an increase in domestic and international demand, along with new product launches in Latin America.\nMineral Nutrition \nNet sales of $242.7 million for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, decreased $16.9 million, or 6%, primarily driven by a decrease in demand for trace minerals, partially offset by higher average selling prices. The increase in average selling prices is correlated to the movement of the underlying raw material costs.\nPerformance Products \nNet sales of $75.4 million for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, decreased $0.3 million, or less than 1%, as a result of decreased demand for both personal care product ingredients and copper-related products, partially offset by higher average selling prices for these products. \nGross profit \nGross profit of\u2009$298.2 million for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, increased $12.8 million, or 4%, as compared to the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02022. Gross margin increased 20 basis points to 30.5% of net sales for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, as compared to 30.3% for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02022. The year ended June 30, 2022, included $0.3 million of acquisition-related cost of goods sold.\nAnimal Health gross profit increased $17.6 million due to higher product demand, partially offset by higher raw material and logistics costs. Mineral Nutrition gross profit decreased $6.9 million, driven by lower sales volume and an increase in raw material costs. Performance Products gross profit increased $1.7 million, due primarily to more favorable product mix.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses \nSG&A expenses of\u2009$226.4 million for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, increased $20.0 million, or 10%, as compared to the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02022. SG&A for the year ended June 30, 2023, included $6.9 million of environmental remediation costs mostly related to the definitive settlement agreement related to the Omega Chemical Site. SG&A for the year ended June 30, 2022, included a $1.2 million gain on sale of investment and $0.3 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. Excluding these items, SG&A increased $12.2 million, or 6%. \nAnimal Health SG&A increased $6.6 million, primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, and an increase in selling costs for our companion animal product. Mineral Nutrition SG&A decreased $0.2 million. Performance Products SG&A increased $1.2 million, mainly due to an increase in employee-related costs. Corporate expenses increased $4.7 million due to an increase in employee-related costs and strategic investments. \nIn July 2023, we entered into an annuity purchase agreement to irrevocably transfer a portion of the pension benefit obligation to a third-party insurance company. The annuity purchase price was $26.4 million and was approximately equal to the benefit obligation transferred. The annuity purchase was funded from pension assets. During the three months ending September 30, 2023, we will recognize the cost of a partial settlement of the pension plan to record an expense of approximately $10.4 million, resulting from the recognition of net pension losses currently included in Accumulated other comprehensive income and a benefit for income taxes of approximately $2.7 million.\n64\n\n\nTable of Contents\nInterest expense, net \n Interest expense, net of\u2009$15.3 million for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, increased by $3.4 million as compared to the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02022. Interest expense increased as a result of increased debt outstanding and higher floating interest rates on portions of debt outstanding, partially offset by increased interest income and a lower average fixed rate from our interest rate swap agreements.\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net \nForeign currency losses, net for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, were\u2009$2.5 million, as compared to net gains of $5.2 million for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02022. Current period losses were driven by fluctuations in certain currencies related to the U.S. dollar.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $21.5 million and $23.2 million for the years ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023 and 2022, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 39.7% and 32.0% for the years ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023 and 2022, respectively. Our effective income tax rate has varied from period to period from a federal statutory rate perspective due to the mix of income in the various jurisdictions where we have operations, changes in tax rates from period to period and the effects of certain other items. The provision for income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2023, included a net cost of $1.5 million for certain one-time items including (i) Global Intangible Low-Tax Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) income taxes that were modified by IRS guidance issued subsequent to June 30, 2023, (ii) the net cost of withholding taxes related to dividends received from an international affiliate and (iii) the net benefit related to certain unrecognized tax benefits from adjustments to and the lapse of statute of limitations of prior years. The provision for income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2022, included a net cost of $0.8 million for certain items including (i) a benefit from the reversal of uncertain tax positions related to settlements and the lapse of statute of limitations of prior years, (ii) an expense related to increases to reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the complex nature of tax law in various jurisdictions and related interpretations of tax law, (iii) a benefit from the release of a valuation allowance, and (iv) an expense related to a detailed analysis of various other items. The effective income tax rate without these items would have been 36.9% and 30.9% for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n  We record the GILTI-related aspects of comprehensive U.S. income tax legislation as a period expense. The provision for income taxes for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, included $1.8 million and $0.2 million of federal tax expense from the effects of GILTI, respectively. Our effective income tax rate included 3.3% and 0.3% related to GILTI income tax expense in the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. GILTI expense increased due to final foreign tax credit regulations that were effective for our fiscal year 2023.\n     In July 2023, the IRS provided guidance to taxpayers in determining whether a foreign tax is eligible for a U.S. foreign tax credit for tax years 2022 and 2023.  As a result of this new guidance, the Company has concluded that we will record a tax benefit of approximately $1.2\u00a0million related to the year ended June 30, 2023 in the three months ending September 30, 2023.\nNet income\nNet income of\u2009$32.6 million for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, decreased $16.6 million, as compared to net income of\u2009$49.2 million for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02022. Operating income decreased $7.1 million driven by higher SG&A, partially offset by higher gross profit. The increase in gross profit was driven by higher product demand in Animal Health and Performance Product, partially offset by higher raw material costs and production costs. SG&A expenses increased by $20.0 million due to environmental remediation costs, higher employee-related costs and strategic investments. Interest expense, net increased $3.4 million, and the change in foreign currency (gains) losses, net resulted in a $7.7 million reduction in income before income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2023. Income tax expense decreased $1.7 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA \n Adjusted EBITDA of\u2009$112.8 million for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023, increased $1.7 million, or 2%, as compared to the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02022. Animal Health Adjusted EBITDA increased $12.0 million, driven by higher sales and increased gross profit, partially offset by an increase in SG&A. Mineral Nutrition Adjusted EBITDA decreased $6.6 \n65\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmillion, driven by lower sales volume and higher raw material costs. Performance Products Adjusted EBITDA increased by $0.6 million due to higher gross profit, partially offset by an increase in SG&A. Corporate expenses increased $4.4 million due to increased employee-related costs and strategic investments.  \nAdjusted provision for income taxes\nThe adjusted effective income tax rates for the year ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, were 33.0% and 29.5%, respectively. The increase in our adjusted effective income tax rate was driven by an unfavorable shift in the geographical mix of earnings. \nThe adjusted provision for income taxes for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, included $0.6 million and $0.2 million from the adjusted effects of GILTI, respectively. Our effective income tax rate included 0.8% and 0.3% related to adjusted GILTI income tax expense.\nAdjusted net income\nAdjusted net income of $49.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, decreased $4.2 million, or 8%, as compared to the prior year. The decrease was driven by higher SG&A, higher interest expense, net and a higher provision for income taxes, partially offset by higher gross profit. The increase in gross profit resulted from higher sales, partially offset by higher raw material and production costs. SG&A expenses increased due to higher employee-related costs and a planned increase in strategic investments.\nAdjusted diluted EPS\nAdjusted diluted EPS was $1.21 for the year ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of $0.10, or 8%, as compared to $1.31 in the prior year.\nComparison of the\u00a0years ended June\u00a030,\u00a02022 and 2021\nFor a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended June\u00a030,\u00a02022 and 2021, and an analysis of our financial condition, liquidity and capital resources for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02022, see \u201cPart II.

Net cash provided by operating activities was driven by business performance, resulting in cash provided by net income and non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, of $54.4 million, offset by cash used in the ordinary course of business for changes in operating assets and liabilities of $41.1 million. Cash provided by accounts receivable was $5.3 million as a result of a favorable reduction in days sales outstanding. Cash used for inventory was $11.2 million due to increased raw material and production costs, product mix, lower than anticipated demand in our Mineral Nutrition products and a projected increase in future demand of other products in our portfolio. Other current assets used $7.4 million due to the timing of insurance payments. Accounts payable used $22.8 million due to timing of purchases and payments. Accrued expenses and other liabilities used $5.7 million, primarily due to changes in employee-related and lease liabilities.\nOperating activities provided $31.6 million of net cash for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02022. Net cash provided by operating activities was driven by strong business performance, resulting in cash provided by net income and non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, of $76.3 million, offset by cash used in the ordinary course of business for changes in operating assets and liabilities of $44.6 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities included $23.6 million of cash used to fund a build of accounts receivable correlated with strong growth in net sales, particularly in the fourth quarter, $47.0 million of cash used to replenish inventory levels during a period when inflation was driving higher costs of material and labor, offset by $26.4 million of cash provided by accounts payable related to the timing of payments to suppliers, with the remaining $0.4 million of cash used to fund changes in other current assets, other assets, and accrued expenses and other liabilities.\nInvesting activities \nInvesting activities used $74.0 million of net cash for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02023.

Proceeds from the 2023 Incremental Term Loan and 2022 Term Loan provided $62.0 million, with debt issuance costs of $1.5 million. We paid $15.3 million in scheduled debt maturities. Net payments on our revolving credit facility under which we could borrow up to $310,000, subject to the terms of the agreement (the \u201c2021 Revolver\u201d) reduced the outstanding balance by $4.0 million. Proceeds from insurance premium financing, net of cash payments, provided cash of $5.2 million. We paid $19.4 million in dividends to holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. \nFinancing activities used $16.3 million of net cash for the year ended June\u00a030,\u00a02022. Net borrowings on our 2021 Revolver provided $50.0 million. We paid $19.4 million in dividends to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. We paid $9.4 million in scheduled debt maturities. We paid $4.8 million for acquisition-related contingent consideration.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nWe believe our cash on hand, our operating cash flows and our financing arrangements, including the availability of borrowings under the 2021 Revolver and foreign credit lines, will be sufficient to support our ongoing cash needs. We have considered the current and potential future effects of the macroeconomic market conditions in the financial markets. At this time, we expect adequate liquidity for at least the next twelve\u00a0months. However, we can provide no assurance that our liquidity and capital resources will be adequate for future funding requirements. We believe we will be able to comply with the terms of the covenants under the 2021 Credit Facilities and foreign credit lines based on our operating plan. In the event of adverse operating results and/or violation of covenants under the facilities, there can be no assurance we would be able to obtain waivers or amendments. Other risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions and macroeconomic, business and financial disruptions that could arise, including those caused by COVID-19 or similar outbreaks and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. There can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn would not affect our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing or fund operations or investment opportunities. In addition, our debt covenants may restrict our ability to invest.

view of performance used by management as our primary operating measure, and we believe that investors\u2019 understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. We report Adjusted EBITDA to reflect the results of our operations prior to considering certain income statement elements. We have defined EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (i) interest expense, net, (ii) provision for income taxes or less benefit for income taxes, and (iii) depreciation and amortization. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus (a) (income) loss from, and disposal of, discontinued operations, (b) other expense or less other income, as separately reported on our consolidated statements of operations, including foreign currency (gains) losses, net and (c) certain items that we consider to be unusual, non-operational or non-recurring. The Adjusted EBITDA measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP reported net income.\n71\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Adjusted EBITDA measure is an important internal measurement for us. We measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. The following are examples of how our Adjusted EBITDA measure is utilized:\n\u25cf\nsenior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an Adjusted EBITDA basis;\n\u25cf\nour annual budgets are prepared on an Adjusted EBITDA basis; and\n\u25cf\nother goal setting and performance measurements are prepared on an Adjusted EBITDA basis.\nDespite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement, Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, has limits in its usefulness to investors. Because of its non-standardized definition, Adjusted EBITDA, unlike GAAP net income, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.\nWe also recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the Adjusted EBITDA measure has limitations, and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to this metric. A limitation of the Adjusted EBITDA measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the depreciation of property, plant and equipment or amortization of acquired intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies.\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share represent alternative views of performance and we believe investors\u2019 understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these performance measures. We report adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share to portray the results of our operations prior to considering certain income statement elements. We have defined adjusted net income as net income plus (i) other expense or less other income, as separately reported on our consolidated statements of operations, including foreign currency gains and losses and loss on extinguishment of debt, (ii) amortization of acquired intangibles and other acquisition-related costs, such as accrued compensation and accrued interest, (iii) stock-based compensation, (iv) certain items that we consider to be unusual or non-recurring and (v) income tax effect of pre-tax income adjustments and certain income tax items. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using the adjusted net income divided by the adjusted diluted number of shares. Adjusted provision for income taxes has been provided to help calculate adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. The adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP reported net income. \nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measure that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of its non-standardized definition, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, unlike GAAP net income, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.\nCertain significant items\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are calculated prior to considering certain items. We evaluate such items on an individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual or non-operational nature. Unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.\nWe consider acquisition-related activities and business restructuring costs related to productivity and cost saving initiatives, including employee separation costs, to be unusual items that we do not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We consider foreign currency gains and losses to be non-operational because they arise principally from intercompany transactions and are largely non-cash in nature.\n72\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNew accounting standards\nFor discussion of new accounting standards, see \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \u2014 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Standards.\u201d\nCritical accounting policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that require application of management\u2019s most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Not all accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates. In presenting our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results that differ from our estimates and assumptions could have an unfavorable effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe following is a summary of accounting policies that we consider critical to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when control of the products has transferred to the customer, typically when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer. Certain of our businesses have terms where control of the underlying product transfers to the customer on shipment, while others have terms where control transfers to the customer on delivery.\nRevenue reflects the total consideration to which we expect to be entitled, in exchange for delivery of products or services, net of variable consideration. Variable consideration includes customer programs and incentive offerings, including pricing arrangements, rebates and other volume-based incentives. We record reductions to revenue for estimated variable consideration at the time we record the sale. Our estimates for variable consideration reflect the amount by which we expect variable consideration to affect the revenue recognized. Such estimates are based on contractual terms and historical experience, and are adjusted to reflect future expectations as new information becomes available. Historically, we have not had significant adjustments to our estimates of customer incentives. Sales returns and product recalls have been insignificant and infrequent due to the nature of the products we sell.\nNet sales include shipping and handling fees billed to customers. The associated costs are considered fulfillment activities, not additional promised services to the customer, and are included in costs of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Net sales exclude value-added and other taxes based on sales.\nBusiness Combinations\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business beginning as of the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition; goodwill is recorded for any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired. Significant judgment may be required to determine the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Significant judgment also may be required to determine the fair values of contingent consideration, if any. We typically utilize third-party valuation specialists to assist us in determining fair values of significant tangible and intangible assets and contingent consideration. The fair values are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to measure the fair value of intangible assets, based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows, specifically the expected revenue growth rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Our estimates of the useful lives of intangible assets primarily are based on a number of factors including the competitive environment, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the products are sold. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated lives. \n73\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIntangible assets associated with acquired in-process research and development activities (\u201cIPR&D\u201d) are not amortized until a product is available for sale and regulatory approval is obtained.\nLong-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nWe periodically review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets for impairment and assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of an asset. We recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss is the excess of the asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value. In addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would affect the amount of depreciation and amortization recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. We assess goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. We may elect to assess our goodwill for impairment using a qualitative or a quantitative approach, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is greater than its carrying value. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we tested goodwill using a quantitative approach and determined goodwill was not impaired. We have not recorded any goodwill impairment charges in the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.\nWe evaluate our investments in equity method investees for impairment if circumstances indicate that the fair value of the investment may be impaired. The assets underlying a $2.8\u00a0million equity investment are currently idle; we have concluded the investment is not impaired, based on expected future operating cash flows and/or disposal value.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes includes U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. Our annual effective income tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future\u00a0years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent the tax effect of items recorded as tax expense in our income statement for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our income statement or the tax effect of assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.\nThe recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management\u2019s best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. Inherent in determining our annual effective income tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, including research and development costs capitalized for income tax purposes and net operating loss carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the amortization or carryforward periods. We establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit.\nWe may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority in the jurisdictions where we operate. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review \n74\n\n\nTable of Contents\nthese tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly.\nWe account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If our initial assessment does not result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the tax benefit if: (i)\u00a0there are changes in tax law or there is new information that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to \u201cmore likely than not\u201d; (ii)\u00a0the statute of limitations expires; or (iii)\u00a0there is a completion of an audit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. We regularly re-evaluate our tax positions based on the results of audits of federal, state and foreign income tax filings, statute of limitations expirations, and changes in tax law or receipt of new information that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to the \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d standard.\nOur assessments concerning uncertain tax positions are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant.\nBecause there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our income tax provision, certain future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective income tax rate.\nWe consider undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested in our international operations. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were subject to the U.S. one-time mandatory toll charge and are eligible to be repatriated to the U.S. without additional U.S. tax under the Tax Act. Should our plans change and we decide to repatriate some or all of the remaining cash held by our international subsidiaries, the amounts repatriated could be subject to applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes in international jurisdictions.\nFor more information regarding our significant accounting policies, estimates and assumptions, see \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u2009\u2014\u2009Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Standards.\u201d\nContingencies\nLegal matters\nWe are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as product liability and other product-related litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings and government investigations. Certain of these contingencies could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, and/or criminal charges, which could be substantial. We believe that we have strong defenses in these types of matters, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid and/or accrued.\nWe have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but the assessment process relies heavily on estimates and assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.\nEnvironmental\nOur operations and properties are subject to Environmental Laws and regulations. As such, the nature of our current and former operations exposes us to the risk of claims with respect to such matters, including fines, penalties and remediation obligations that may be imposed by regulatory authorities. Under certain circumstances, we might be required to curtail operations until a particular problem is remedied. Known costs and expenses under Environmental \n75\n\n\nTable of Contents\nLaws incidental to ongoing operations, including the cost of litigation proceedings relating to environmental matters, are generally included within operating results. Potential costs and expenses may also be incurred in connection with the repair or upgrade of facilities to meet existing or new requirements under Environmental Laws or to investigate or remediate potential or actual contamination and from time to time we establish reserves for such contemplated investigation and remediation costs. In many instances, the ultimate costs under Environmental Laws and the time period during which such costs are likely to be incurred are difficult to predict.\nWhile we believe that our operations are currently in material compliance with Environmental Laws, we have, from time to time, received notices of violation from governmental authorities, and have been involved in civil or criminal action for such violations. Additionally, at various sites, our subsidiaries are engaged in continuing investigation, remediation and/or monitoring efforts to address contamination associated with historic operations of the sites. We devote considerable resources to complying with Environmental Laws and managing environmental liabilities. We have developed programs to identify requirements under, and maintain compliance with Environmental Laws; however, we cannot predict with certainty the impact of increased and more stringent regulation on our operations, future capital expenditure requirements, or the cost of compliance.\nThe nature of our current and former operations exposes us to the risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and we cannot assure we will not incur material costs and liabilities in connection with such claims. Based upon our experience to date, we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing Environmental Laws, and liabilities for known environmental claims pursuant to such Environmental Laws, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nFor additional details, see \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u2009\u2014\u2009Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nFor additional details, see \u201cBusiness\u2009\u2014\u2009Environmental, Health and Safety.\u201d\n\u200b",
    "item7a": ">Item\u00a07A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nForeign exchange risk\nPortions of our net sales and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchanges rates. Our products are sold in more than 80 countries and, as a result, our revenues are influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates. Because we operate in multiple foreign currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could affect our revenue and expenses, and consequently, net income. Exchange rate fluctuations may also have an effect beyond our reported financial results and directly affect operations. These fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services in markets affected by significant exchange rate variances. \nOur primary foreign currency exposures are to the Brazilian and Israeli currencies. From time to time, we manage foreign exchange risk through the use of foreign currency derivative contracts. We use these contracts to mitigate the potential earnings effects from exposure to foreign currencies.\nWe analyzed our foreign currency derivative contracts at June\u00a030,\u00a02023 to determine their sensitivity to exchange rate changes. The analysis indicates that if the U.S. dollar were to appreciate or depreciate by 10%, the fair value of these contracts would decrease or increase by $0.2\u00a0million. For additional details, see \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u2009\u2014\u2009Derivatives.\u201d\nInterest rate risk\nWe have effectively converted $300 million of our outstanding debt to fixed interest rates through June 2025, through the use of an interest rate swap agreement. Our debt is subject to floating interest rates to the extent not effectively converted to fixed interest rate debt. Our 2021 Credit Facilities carry floating interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) (previously the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d)) or the Prime Rate. Therefore, our profitability and cash flows are exposed to interest rate fluctuations. Our interest rates also include variable applicable rates in addition to the SOFR portion of our interest obligation. The applicable rates vary from 1.50% to 2.75%, based on the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, as defined in the 2021 Credit Facilities.\nIn March 2020, and amended in November 2022, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted the floating SOFR portion of our interest obligation to a fixed rate of 0.61% on a $300 million principal amount. We designated the interest rate swap as a highly effective cash flow hedge. \n76\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBased on our outstanding debt balances and the applicable rate in effect as of June\u00a030,\u00a02023, and considering the interest rate swap agreement, a 100-basis point increase in SOFR would increase annual interest expense and decrease cash flows by $1.8 million. For additional details, see \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u2009\u2014\u2009Debt\u201d and \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u2009\u2014\u2009Derivatives.\u201d\n\u200b\n77\n\n\nTable of Contents",
