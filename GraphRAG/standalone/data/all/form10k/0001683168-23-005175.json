    "item1": ">ITEM 1. BUSINESS.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a biotechnology company focused on developing\ncellular therapies for cancer, diabetes, and malignant ascites based upon a proprietary cellulose-based live cell encapsulation technology\nknown as \u201cCell-in-a-Box\u00ae.\u201d The Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae technology is intended to be used as a platform upon which therapies\nfor several types of cancer, including LAPC, will be developed. The current generation of our product candidate is referred to as \u201cCypCaps\u2122.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn August 15, 2022, we entered into a Cooperation\nAgreement (the \u201cCooperation Agreement\u201d) with Iroquois Master Fund Ltd. and its affiliates, pursuant to which we elected a\nreconstituted board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The Board then formed a Business Review Committee to evaluate, investigate\nand review our business, affairs, strategy, management and operations and in its sole discretion, to make recommendations to our management\nand Board with respect thereto. The Business Review Committee is also reviewing many of the risks relative to our business. In addition,\nthe Board is reviewing risks associated with our development programs and our relationship with SG Austria Pte. Ltd (\u201cSG Austria\u201d),\nincluding that all licensed patents have expired, that know-how relating to our Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae technology solely resides with SG Austria,\nand that the incentives of SG Austria and its management may not be currently aligned with ours. The Board has curtailed spending on our\nprograms, including pre-clinical and clinical activities, until the review by the Business Review Committee and the Board is complete\nand the Board has determined the actions and plans to be implemented. The Business Review Committee\u2019s recommendations will include\npotentially seeking a new framework for our relationship with SG Austria and its subsidiaries. If we are unsuccessful in seeking an acceptable\nnew framework, we will reevaluate whether we should continue those programs which are dependent on SG Austria, including our development\nprograms for locally advanced, inoperable, non-metastatic pancreatic cancer (\u201cLAPC\u201d), diabetes and malignant ascites. The\nissues involving SG Austria have delayed our timeline for addressing the FDA clinical hold for its planned clinical trial in LAPC and\ncould result in other delays or termination of the development activities. In addition, the curtailment of spending on our programs pending\nthe review by the Business Review Committee and the Board may cause additional delays.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae encapsulation technology\npotentially enables genetically engineered live human cells to be used as a means to produce various biologically active molecules. The\ntechnology is intended to result in the formation of pinhead-sized cellulose-based porous capsules in which genetically modified live\nhuman cells can be encapsulated and maintained. In a laboratory setting, this proprietary live cell encapsulation technology has been\nshown to create a micro-environment in which encapsulated cells survive and flourish. They are protected from environmental challenges,\nsuch as the sheer forces associated with bioreactors and passage through catheters and needles, which we believe enables greater cell\ngrowth and production of the active molecules. The capsules are largely composed of cellulose (cotton) and are bioinert.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have been developing therapies for pancreatic\nand other solid cancerous tumors by using genetically engineered live human cells that we believe are capable of converting a cancer prodrug\ninto its cancer-killing form. We encapsulate those cells using the Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae technology and place those capsules in the body\nas close as possible to the tumor. In this way, we believe that when a cancer prodrug is administered to a patient with a particular type\nof cancer that may be affected by the prodrug, the killing of the patient\u2019s cancerous tumor may be optimized.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have also been developing a way to delay the\nproduction and accumulation of malignant ascites that results from many types of abdominal cancerous tumors. Our potential therapy for\nmalignant ascites involves using the same encapsulated cells we employ for pancreatic cancer but placing the encapsulated cells in the\nperitoneal cavity of a patient and administering ifosfamide intravenously.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have also been developing a potential therapy\nfor Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes. Our product candidate for the treatment of diabetes consists of encapsulated\ngenetically modified insulin-producing cells. The encapsulation will be done using the Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae technology. Implanting these\nencapsulated cells in the body is designed to have them function as a bio-artificial pancreas for purposes of insulin production.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to the two cancer programs discussed\nabove, we have been working on ways to exploit the benefits of the Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae technology to develop therapies for cancer that\ninvolve prodrugs based upon certain constituents of the Cannabis plant. However, until the FDA allows us to commence our clinical trial\nin LAPC and we are able to validate our Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae encapsulation technology in a clinical trial, we are not spending any further\nresources developing our Cannabis Program.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, we have been developing a potential therapy\nfor Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes. Our product candidate for the treatment of diabetes consists of encapsulated\ngenetically modified insulin-producing cells. The encapsulation will be done using the Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae technology. Implanting these\nencapsulated cells in the body is designed to have them function as a bio-artificial pancreas for purposes of insulin production.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUntil the Business Review Committee completes\nits evaluation of our programs and we enter into a new framework for its relationship with SG Austria, spending on our development programs\nhas been curtailed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvestigational New Drug Application and Clinical\nHold\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn September 1, 2020, we submitted an IND to the\nFDA for a planned clinical trial in LAPC. On October 1, 2020, we received notice from the FDA that it had placed our IND on clinical hold.\nOn October 30, 2020, the FDA sent us a letter setting forth the reasons for the clinical hold and providing specific guidance on what\nwe must do to have the clinical hold lifted.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn order to address the clinical hold, the FDA\nhas requested that we:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nProvide additional sequencing data and genetic\nstability studies;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nConduct a stability study on our final formulated\nproduct candidate as well as the cells from our Master Cell Bank (\u201cMCB\u201d);\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nEvaluate the compatibility of the delivery devices\n(the prefilled syringe and the microcatheter used to implant the CypCaps\u2122) with our product candidate for pancreatic cancer;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nProvide additional detailed description of the\nmanufacturing process of our product candidate for pancreatic cancer;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nProvide additional product release specifications\nfor our encapsulated cells;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nDemonstrate comparability between the 1st and\n2nd generation of our product candidate for pancreatic cancer and ensure adequate and consistent product performance and safety between\nthe two generations;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nConduct a biocompatibility assessment using the\ncapsules material;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nAddress specified insufficiencies in the Chemistry,\nManufacturing and Controls information in the cross-referenced Drug Master File;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nConduct an additional nonclinical study in a\nlarge animal (such as a pig) to assess the safety, activity, and distribution of the product candidate for pancreatic cancer; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nRevise the Investigators Brochure to include\nany additional preclinical studies conducted in response to the clinical hold and remove any statements not supported by the data we generated.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA also requested that we address the following\nissues as an amendment to our IND:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nProvide a Certificate of Analysis for pc3/2B1\nplasmid that includes tests for assessing purity, safety, and potency;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nPerform qualification studies for the drug substance\nfilling step to ensure that the product candidate for pancreatic cancer remains sterile and stable during the filling process;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nSubmit an updated batch analysis for the product\ncandidate for the specific lot that will be used for manufacturing all future product candidates;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nProvide additional details for the methodology\nfor the Resorufin (CYP2B1) potency and the PrestoBlue cell metabolic assays;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nProvide a few examples of common microcatheters\nthat fit the specifications in our Angiography Procedure Manual;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nClarify the language in our Pharmacy Manual regarding\nproper use of the syringe fill with the product candidate for pancreatic cancer; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nProvide a discussion with data for trial of the\npotential for cellular and humoral immune reactivity against the heterologous rat CYP2B1 protein and potential for induction of autoimmune-mediated\ntoxicities in our study population.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe assembled a scientific and regulatory team\nof experts to address the FDA requests. That team has been working diligently to complete the items requested by the FDA. We are in the\nlatter stages of conducting the studies and providing the information requested by the FDA. We have completed the pilot study of two pigs\nand are evaluating the preliminary data before it commences the larger study of 90 pigs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following provides a detailed summary of our\nactivities to have the clinical hold lifted:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nAdditional Regulatory Expertise Added to IND\nTeam\n. In addition to \u200cour existing team of regulatory experts, we retained Biologics Consulting to perform a regulatory \u201cGap\nAnalysis\u201d and to assist us with our resubmission of the IND. Biologics Consulting is a full-service regulatory and product development\nconsulting firm for biologics, pharmaceuticals and medical devices and has personnel with extensive FDA experience.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nStability Studies on Our Clinical Trial Product\nCandidate for Pancreatic Cancer\n. We have successfully completed the required product stability studies. The timepoints were 3, 6,\n9, 12, 18 and 24 months of our product candidate for pancreatic cancer being stored frozen at -80C. These studies included container closure\nintegrity testing for certain timepoints.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nAdditional Studies Requested by the FDA\n.\nWe have successfully completed various additional studies requested by the FDA, including a stability study on the cells from our MCB\nused to make our CypCaps\u2122. We are already at the 36-month stability timepoint for the cells from our MCB. We are also collating\nexisting information on the reproducibility and quality of the filling of the MCB cells into vials ready for CypCaps\u2122 manufacturing.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nDetermination of the Exact Sequence of the\nCytochrome P450 2B1 Gene\n. We have completed the determination of the exact sequence of the cytochrome P450 2B1 gene inserted at the\nsite previously identified on chromosome 9 using state-of-the-art nanopore sequencing. This is a cutting edge, unique and scalable technology\nthat permits real-time analysis of long DNA fragments. The result of this analysis of the sequence data confirmed that the genes are intact.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nConfirmation of the Exact Sequence of the\nCytochrome P450 2B1 Gene Insert\n. An additional, more detailed analysis of the integration site of the cytochrome P450 2B1 gene from\nthe augmented HEK293 cell clone that is used in our CypCaps\u2122 was found to be intact. In this new study, we were able to confirm\nthe previously determined structure of the integrated transgene sequence using more data points. These studies also set the stage for\na next step analysis to determine the genetic stability of the cytochrome P450 2B1 gene at the DNA level after multiple rounds of cell\ngrowth. This new study has been completed in which our original Research Cell Bank (\u201cRCB\u201d) cells were compared with cells\nfrom the MCB. The analysis confirmed that the cytochrome P450 2B1 and the surrounding sequence has remained stable with no changes detected\nat the DNA level.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nBiocompatibility Studies\n. We have been\ninvolved with 10 biocompatibility studies requested by the FDA, eight of which have been completed successfully. The remaining studies\nare underway or about to start. The Acute Systemic Toxicity Study of Empty Cellulose Sulphate Capsules in Mice is underway. The Skin Sensitization\nStudy of Empty Cellulose Sulphate Capsules in Guinea Pigs is about to start. These last two studies \u200cshould be completed well before\nthe pig study (see below) is completed. To enable the biocompatibility studies to be performed, we had Austrianova Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n(\u201cAustrianova\u201d) manufacture an additional 400 syringes of empty capsules.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nSystemic Toxicity Testing\n. We evaluated\nthe potential toxicity of the capsule component of our product candidate for pancreatic cancer\u200c and determined there is no evidence\nof toxicity in any of the parameters examined. The study also confirmed previous data that shows our capsule material is bioinert.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nMicro-Compression and Swelling Testing\n.\nThis testing is underway. We are developing and optimizing two reproducible methods for testing and confirming the physical stability\nand integrity of our CypCaps\u2122 under extreme pressure. These studies required the acquisition of new equipment by Austrianova as\nwell as validation and integration into Austrianova\u2019s Quality Control laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nBreak Force and Glide Testing\n. We are\nin the process of developing a protocol to measure whether the syringe, attached to the catheter when used to expel the capsules, will\nstill have a break and glide force that is within the specifications we have established. We are setting the specifications based on the\nsyringe/plunger manufacturer\u2019s measured break and glide forces, or alternatively, accepted ranges for glide forces routinely used\nin the clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nCapsules Compatibility with the Syringe and\nOther Components of the Microcatheter Delivery System\n. We are in the process of showing that CypCaps\u2122 are not in any way adversely\naffected by the catheters used by interventional radiologists to deliver them into a patient. Compatibility data is being generated to\ndemonstrate that the quality of the CypCaps\u2122 is maintained after passage through the planned microcatheter systems.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nCypCaps Capsules and Cell Viability after\nExposure to Contrast Medium\n. We have commenced testing to show that exposure of CypCaps\u2122 to the contrast medium interventional\nradiologists \u200cused to implant the CypCaps\u2122 in a patient has no adverse effect on CypCaps\u2122. Contrast medium is used to\nvisualize the blood vessels during implantation.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nMaster Drug File Information\n. Austrianova\nis providing additional detailed confidential information on the manufacturing process, including information on the improvements and\nadvancements made to our product candidate for pancreatic cancer since the last clinical trials were conducted with respect to reproducibility\nand safety. However, Austrianova has not changed the overall physical characteristics of CypCaps\u2122 between the 1st and 2nd generations.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nAdditional Documentation Requested by the\nFDA\n. We are in the process of updating our IND submission documentation, including our discussion on immunological aspects of our\ntreatment for LAPC.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nPig Study\n. We have commenced a study in\npigs to address biocompatibility and long-term implantation and dispersion of CypCaps\u2122. The study has two phases: (i) a pilot study\nwith 2 pigs; and (ii) a 90-pig study. The first phase has been completed and we are evaluating preliminary data. We believe this study\nshould complement the positive data already available from the previous human clinical trials showing the safety of CypCaps\u2122 implantation\nin human patients. The second phase of the pig study may be delayed as a result of supply chain problems, production delays at Austrianova,\nand to our curtailment of spending pending review of our programs by the Business Review Committee and the reconstituted Board, including\nseeking a new framework for its relationship with SG Austria and its subsidiaries.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHistory of the Business\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 2013, we restructured\nour operations to focus on biotechnology. On January 6, 2015, we changed our name from \u201cNuvilex, Inc.\u201d to \u201cPharmaCyte\nBiotech, Inc.\u201d to reflect the nature of our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a biotechnology\ncompany focused on developing and preparing to commercialize cellular therapies for cancer, diabetes, and malignant ascites using our\nlive cell encapsulation technology. This resulted from entering into the following agreements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCommencing in May 2011,\nwe entered into a series of agreements and amendments with SG Austria Pte. Ltd. (\u201cSG Austria\u201d) to acquire certain assets from\nSG Austria as well as an exclusive, worldwide license to use, with a right to sublicense, the Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae\u00a0technology and trademark\nfor the development of therapies for cancer (\u201cSG Austria APA\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn June 2013, we and\nSG Austria entered a Third Addendum to the SG Austria APA (\u201cThird Addendum\u201d). The Third Addendum materially changed the transaction\ncontemplated by the SG Austria APA. Under the Third Addendum, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Bio Blue Bird and received a\n14.5% equity interest in SG Austria. We paid: (i) $500,000 to retire all outstanding debt of Bio Blue Bird; and (ii) $1.0 million to SG\nAustria. We also paid SG Austria $1,572,193 in exchange for a 14.5% equity interest of SG Austria. The transaction required SG Austria\nto return to us the 66,667 shares of our common stock held by SG Austria and for us to return to SG Austria the 67 shares of common stock\nof Austrianova we held.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEffective as of the same\ndate we entered the Third Addendum, we and SG Austria also entered a Clarification Agreement to the Third Addendum (\u201cClarification\nAgreement\u201d) to clarify and include certain language that was inadvertently left out of the Third Addendum. Among other things, the\nClarification Agreement confirmed that the Third Addendum granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to use, with a right to sublicense,\nthe Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae\u00a0technology and trademark for the development of therapies for cancer.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith respect to Bio Blue\nBird, Bavarian Nordic A/S (\u201cBavarian Nordic\u201d) and GSF-Forschungszentrum f\u00fcr Umwelt u. Gesundheit GmbH (collectively,\n\u201cBavarian Nordic/GSF\u201d) and Bio Blue Bird entered into a non-exclusive License Agreement (\u201cBavarian Nordic/GSF License\nAgreement\u201d) in July 2005, whereby Bio Blue Bird was granted a non-exclusive license to further develop, make, have made (including\nservices under contract for Bio Blue Bird or a sub-licensee, by Contract Manufacturing Organizations, Contract Research Organizations,\nConsultants, Logistics Companies or others), obtain marketing approval, sell and offer for sale the clinical data generated from the pancreatic\ncancer clinical trials that used the cells and capsules developed by Bavarian Nordic/GSF (then known as \u201cCapCells\u2122\u201d)\nor otherwise use the licensed patent rights related thereto in the countries in which patents had been granted. Bio Blue Bird was required\nto pay Bavarian Nordic a royalty of 3% of the net sales value of each licensed product sold by Bio Blue Bird and/or its Affiliates and/or\nits sub-licensees to a buyer. The term of the Bavarian Nordic/GSF License Agreement continued on a country-by-country basis until the\nexpiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBavarian Nordic/GSF and\nBio Blue Bird amended the Bavarian Nordic License Agreement in December 2006 (\u201cFirst Amendment to Bavarian Nordic/GSF License Agreement\u201d)\nto reflect that: (i) the license granted was exclusive; (ii) a royalty rate increased from 3% to 4.5%; (iii) Bio Blue Bird assumed the\npatent prosecution expenses for the existing patents; and (iv) to make clear that the license will survive as a license granted by one\nof the licensors if the other licensor rejects performance under the Bavarian Nordic License Agreement due to any actions or declarations\nof insolvency.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn June 2013, we acquired\nfrom Austrianova an exclusive, worldwide license to use the Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae\u00a0technology and trademark for the development of a\ntherapy for Type 1 and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes (\u201cDiabetes Licensing Agreement\u201d). This allows us to develop a therapy\nto treat diabetes through encapsulation of a human cell line that has been genetically modified to produce, store and release insulin\nin response to the levels of blood sugar in the human body.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn October 2014, we entered\ninto an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with the UTS (\u201cMelligen Cell License Agreement\u201d) in Australia to use insulin-producing\ngenetically engineered human liver cells developed by UTS to treat Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes. These cells,\nnamed \u201cMelligen,\u201d were tested by UTS in mice and shown to produce insulin in direct proportion to the amount of glucose in\ntheir surroundings. In those studies, when Melligen cells were transplanted into immunosuppressed diabetic mice, the blood glucose levels\nof the mice became normal. In other words, the Melligen cells reportedly reversed the diabetic condition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn December 2014, we\nacquired from Austrianova an exclusive, worldwide license to use the Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae\u00a0technology and trademark in combination with\ngenetically modified non-stem cell lines which are designed to activate cannabinoid prodrug molecules for development of therapies for\ndiseases and their related symptoms using of the Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae\u00a0technology and trademark (\u201cCannabis Licensing Agreement\u201d).\nThis allows us to develop a therapy to treat cancer and other diseases and symptoms through encapsulation of genetically modified cells\ndesigned to convert cannabinoids to their active form using the Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae\u00a0technology and trademark.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn July 2016, we entered\ninto a Binding Memorandum of Understanding with Austrianova (\u201cAustrianova MOU\u201d). Pursuant to the Austrianova MOU, Austrianova\nwill actively work with us to seek an investment partner or partners who will finance clinical trials and further develop products for\nour therapy for cancer, in exchange for which we, Austrianova and any future investment partner will each receive a portion of the net\nrevenue from the sale of cancer products.\n\n\nIn October 2016, Bavarian\nNordic/GSF and Bio Blue Bird further amended the Bavarian Nordic License Agreement (\u201cSecond Amendment to Bavarian Nordic/GSF License\nAgreement\u201d) in order to: (i) include the right to import in the scope of the license; (ii) reflect ownership and notification of\nimprovements; (iii) clarify which provisions survive expiration or termination of the Bavarian Nordic License Agreement; (iv) provide\nrights to Bio Blue Bird to the clinical data after the expiration of the licensed patent rights; and (v) change the notice address and\nrecipients of Bio Blue Bird.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn May 2018, we entered\ninto a series of binding term sheet amendments (\u201cBinding Term Sheet Amendments\u201d). The Binding Term Sheet Amendments provide\nthat our obligation to make milestone payments to Austrianova is eliminated in their entirety under the: (i) Cannabis License Agreement;\nand (ii) the Diabetes License Agreement, as amended. The Binding Term Sheet Amendments also provide that our obligation to make milestone\npayments to SG Austria for therapies for cancer be eliminated in their entirety. In addition, the Binding Term Sheet Amendments also provides\nthat the scope of the Diabetes License Agreement is expanded to include all cell types and cell lines of any kind or description now or\nlater identified, including, but not limited to, primary cells, mortal cells, immortal cells and stem cells at all stages of differentiation\nand from any source specifically designed to produce insulin for the treatment of diabetes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, one of the\nBinding Term Sheet Amendments provides that we will have a 5-year right of first refusal from August 30, 2017 in the event that Austrianova\nchooses to sell, transfer or assign at any time during this period the Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae\u00a0technology, tradename and Associated Technologies\n(defined below), intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how, which includes the right to purchase any manufacturing facility used\nfor the Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae\u00a0encapsulation process and a non-exclusive license to use the special cellulose sulfate utilized with the\nCell-in-a-Box\u00ae\u00a0encapsulation process (collectively, \u201cAssociated Technologies\u201d); provided, however, that the Associated\nTechnologies subject to the right of first refusal do not include Bac-in-a-Box\u00ae\u00a0(which is used to encapsulate bacteria). Additionally,\nfor a period of one year from August 30, 2017 one of the Binding Term Sheet Amendments provides that Austrianova will not solicit, negotiate\nor entertain any inquiry regarding the potential acquisition of the Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae\u00a0and its Associated Technologies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Binding Term Sheet\nAmendments further provide that: (i) the royalty payments on gross sales as specified in the SG Austria APA, the Cannabis License Agreement\nand the Diabetes License Agreement are changed to 4%; and (ii) the royalty payments on amounts received by us from sublicensees on sublicensees\u2019\ngross sales under the same agreements are changed to 20% of the amount received us from our sublicensees, provided, however,\u00a0that\nin the event the amounts received by us from sublicensees is 4% or less of sublicensees\u2019 gross sales, Austrianova will receive 50%\nof what we receive (up to 2%) and then additionally 20% of any amount we receive over that 4%.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOne of the Binding Term\nSheet Amendments requires that we pay $900,000 to Austrianova ratably over a nine-month period in the amount of two $50,000 payments each\nmonth during the nine-month period on the days of the month to be agreed upon between the parties, with a cure period of 20 calendar days\nafter receipt by us of written notice from Austrianova that we have failed to pay timely a monthly payment. As of April 30, 2020, the\n$900,000 amount has been paid in full. The Binding Term Sheet Amendments also provide that Austrianova receives 50% of any other financial\nand non-financial consideration received from our sublicensees of the Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae\u00a0technology.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Operations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn March 2020, the World\nHealth Organization declared an outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the world\u2019s economies have experienced pronounced effects.\nDespite the multiple COVID-19 vaccines globally, there remains uncertainty around the extent and duration of disruption and any future\nrelated financial impact cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. COVID-19 has caused and may continue to cause significant, industry-wide\ndelays in clinical trials. Although we are not yet in a clinical trial, we have filed an IND with the FDA to commence a clinical trial\nin LAPC, and this clinical trial may experience delays relating to COVID-19 once commenced, including but not limited to: (i) delays or\ndifficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trial if the FDA allows us to go forward with the trial; (ii) delays or difficulties\nin clinical site activation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site personnel; (iii) delays\nin clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct the clinical trial, including interruption in global shipping\nthat may affect the transport of our clinical trial product; (iv) changes in local regulations as part of a response to COVID-19 which\nmay require us to change the ways in which its clinical trial is to be conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue\nthe clinical trial altogether; (v) diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion\nof hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trial; (vi) interruption of key\nclinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state\ngovernments, employers and others, or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, the occurrence of which could\naffect the integrity of clinical trial data; (vii) risk that participants enrolled in our clinical trials will acquire COVID-19 while\nthe clinical trial is ongoing, which could impact the results of the clinical trial, including by increasing the number of observed adverse\nevents; (viii) delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees, and other important agencies and contractors\ndue to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees; (ix) limitations in employee resources that would\notherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trial because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees\nto avoid contact with large groups of people; (x) refusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies; and\n(xi) interruption or delays to our clinical trial activities. Many of these potential delays may be exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19\nin foreign countries where we are conducting these preclinical studies, including India, Europe, Singapore and Thailand.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurther, the various\nprecautionary measures taken by many governmental authorities around the world in order to limit the spread of COVID-19 has had and may\ncontinue to have an adverse effect on the global markets and global economy, including on the availability and pricing of employees, resources,\nmaterials, manufacturing and delivery efforts and other aspects of the global economy. COVID-19 could materially disrupt our business\nand operations, hamper its ability to raise additional funds or sell securities, continue to slow down the overall economy, curtail consumer\nspending, interrupt our supply chain, and make it hard to adequately staff our operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n7\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMarket Opportunity\nand Competitive Landscape\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe three areas we are\ndeveloping for live cell encapsulation-based therapies are cancer, diabetes and malignant ascites.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae\u00a0\ncapsules\nare comprised of cotton\u2019s natural component \u2013 cellulose. Other materials used by competitors include alginate, collagen, chitosan,\ngelatin and agarose. Alginate appears to be the most widely used of these. We believe the inherent strength and durability of our cellulose-based\ncapsules provides us with advantages over the competition. They do so with no evidence of rupture, damage, degradation, fibrous overgrowth\nor immune system response. The cells within the capsules also remained alive and functioning during these studies. Other encapsulating\nmaterials degrade in the human body over time, leaving the encapsulated cells open to immune system attack. Damage to surrounding tissues\nhas also been reported to occur over time when other types of encapsulation materials begin to degrade.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe cells encapsulated\nusing the Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae\n\u00a0technology can be frozen for extended periods of time. When thawed, the cells are recovered\nwith approximately 85% viability. We are unaware of any other cell encapsulation material that is capable of protecting their encapsulated\ncells to this degree. The implications of this property of the Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae\u00a0\ntechnology are obvious \u2013 long-term\nstorage of encapsulated cells and shipment of encapsulated cells over long distances.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe our live cell\nencapsulation technology may have significant new advantages and opportunities for us in numerous and developing ways. For example:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nCancerous diseases may be treated by placing encapsulated drug-converting cells that convert a chemotherapy prodrug near the cancerous tumor;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nConfinement and maintenance of therapeutic cells that activate a chemotherapy prodrug may be placed at the site of implantation in a blood vessel near the cancerous tumor results in \u201ctargeted chemotherapy\u201d;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nIncreased efficacy of a chemotherapy prodrug may allow for lower doses of the prodrug to be given to a patient, significantly reducing or even eliminating side effects from the chemotherapy;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nEncapsulating genetically modified live cells has the potential for the treatment of systemic diseases of various types, including diabetes;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nMulti-layered trade secret protection and marketing exclusivity for our technology exists and is being expanded;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nCell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae\n\u00a0capsules can prevent immune system attack of functional cells inside them without the need for immunosuppressive drug therapy; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nPromising data with the Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae\n\u00a0technology and the cells used with our technology from animal and initial human clinical trials.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPancreatic cancer is\nincreasing in most industrialized countries. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2022 there will be 62,210 people in the U.S.\ndiagnosed with pancreatic cancer. It also estimates 48,830 patients with pancreatic cancer will die in 2022. Pancreatic cancer accounts\nfor about 3% of all cancers in the U.S. and about 7% of all cancer deaths.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur goal is to satisfy\na clear unmet medical need for patients with LAPC whose tumors no longer respond after 4-6 months of treatment with the chemotherapy combination\nof Abraxane\n\u00ae\u00a0\nplus gemcitabine or the four-drug combination known as FOLFIRINOX. For these patients, there is currently\nno effective therapy. We believe there will be no therapy comparable to our Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae\u00a0\nplus low dose of ifosfamide\ncombination therapy when it is used in these patients.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe face intense competition\nin the field of treating pancreatic cancer. There are dozens of startups, smaller biotech companies, big pharma, and several academic\ninstitutions and cancer centers all trying to improve the outcome for pancreatic cancer patients. For example, in a single patient case\nreport published June 2022 in the New England Journal of Medicine, a study funded by the Providence Portland Medical Foundation in conjunction\nwith the Earle A. Chiles Research Institute reported objective regression of metastatic pancreatic cancer using genetically-engineered\nautologous T cells. There are several drugs already available and in the pipelines of pharmaceutical companies worldwide, not the least\nof which is the combination of the drugs of Abraxane\n\u00ae\u00a0\nand gemcitabine. This is the primary FDA-approved combination\nof drugs for treating advanced pancreatic cancer. In Europe and in the U.S., the 4-drug combination FOLFIRINOX has also found use as a\nfirst-line treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. Some of our competitive strengths include the Orphan Drug Designation we have been\ngranted by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency for our pancreatic cancer therapy, our trade secrets, the patents we are seeking\nand the licensing agreements we have that are described in this Report. Yet many of our competitors have substantially greater financial\nand marketing resources than we do. They also have stronger name recognition, better brand loyalty and long-standing relationships with\ncustomers and suppliers. Our future success will be dependent upon our ability to compete.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe our product\ncandidate for pancreatic cancer has already shown promise through the completion of a Phase 1/2 and a Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced,\ninoperable pancreatic cancer carried out in Europe by Bavarian Nordic in 1998 \u2013 1999 and 2000, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have a number of competitors\ndeveloping\u00a0\nCannabis\n-based treatments for cancer. In February 2021, Jazz Pharmaceuticals Public Limited Company (\u201cJazz\u201d),\na neuroscience and oncology focused company, acquired GW Pharmaceuticals, PLC for $7.2 billion. Jazz now has two approved cannabinoid\nextract-based products: Epidiolex\n\u00ae\n\u00a0(CBD) oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut\nsyndrome, Dravet syndrome or tuberous sclerosis complex, and Sativex\n\u00ae\n\u00a0(THC/CBD) oromucosal spray for the treatment\nof severe multiple sclerosis spasticity. Sativex\n\u00ae\n\u00a0is currently being studied in conjunction with the Brain Tumour\nCharity and the UK National Health Service to examine effectiveness in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma brain tumor when used alongside\nthe chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide. Jazz\u2019s pipeline indications include: neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, neuropsychiatry\ntargets, autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, spasticity and undisclosed targets. Cannabis Science, Inc. (\u201cCBIS\u201d) has a number\nof indications in its product development pipeline, all pre-clinical, the most advanced being for the treatment of oxidative stress, psychosis/anxiety,\nPTSD, and sleep deprivation. CBIS also has plans to develop treatments for Stage 4 lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. CNBX Pharmaceuticals\nInc. (previously Cannabics Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) (\u201cCNBX\u201d) has a primary research focus on the development of cannabinoid\ntherapies for the treatment of cancer, mainly cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, breast and prostate. CNBX\u2019s other\u00a0\nCannabis\n-based\nareas of research include Alzheimer\u2019s disease, mental health conditions, and auto-immune diseases. Cannabotech Ltd. (\u201cCannabotech\u201d),\nan Israeli company, in collaboration with Haifa University, is studying an improved method for killing pancreatic and colon cancer cells\nusing a botanical drug based on an extract of the\u00a0\nCyathus striatus\n\u00a0fungus and a cannabinoid extract. Cannabotech is also\ndeveloping therapies for breast, lung and prostate cancers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn contrast to the work\nbeing done by these companies, we plan to focus on developing specific therapies based on chosen molecules rather than using\u00a0\nCannabis\n\u00a0extracts.\nWe intend to use the Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae\n\u00a0technology in combination with genetically-modified cell lines designed to activate\ncannabinoid molecules for the targeted treatment of diseases and their related symptoms.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention estimates that in 2022 a total of 37.3 million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with diabetes (11.3% of the\nU.S. population) and another 8.5 million people (23.0% of adults) are undiagnosed. The diabetes market is estimated in the tens of billions\nof dollars, and it continues to grow.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n9\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe field of diabetes cell therapy development\nis very competitive. There are numerous companies developing cell-based therapies for diabetes. These competitors include companies such\nas ViaCyte, Inc. which has two stem cell-based product candidates in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for type 1 diabetes: PEC-Direct, which\nis a pouch that is \u201copen\u201d to the surrounding vasculature and requires the use of immunosuppressive drugs, and PEC-Encap, which\nis a pouch that contains the implanted cells and prevents contact with the vasculature and immune cells but still allows passage of nutrients\nand proteins to travel between the cells inside the device and blood vessels which grow along the outside of the device. PEC-Encap is\nreported to generally prevent immune rejection and immune sensitization. Conceptually, PEC-Encap has similarities with Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae.\nOther companies developing some form of encapsulation-based diabetes therapy include Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Defymed, Diatranz Otsuka\nLimited, Seraxis, Inc., Unicyte AG, Sernova Corp., Betalin Therapeutics Ltd., Novo Nordisk, Beta-O2 Technologies Ltd., Eli Lilly &\nCo. in collaboration with Sigilon Therapeutics, Inc. and the Diabetes Research Institute Foundation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough such competition exists in the diabetes\nspace, we believe these other companies are developing encapsulation-based therapies using materials and methodologies that produce capsules\nor devices that are far less robust than ours or that are associated with other problems, such as extremely short shelf-life of the product\nand/or fibrotic overgrowth of their encapsulation products when implanted in the body. We believe these properties are not characteristic\nof the Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae\u00a0capsules. Our product candidate for diabetes has shown promise. Completed research studies have resulted\nin positive responses in animal models using the Melligen cells. We believe we are in a strong competitive position considering our unique\nencapsulation technology and the genetically modified cells that we have the exclusive worldwide license to use in most industrialized\ncountries.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMalignant ascites occurs when cancer cells irritate\nthe peritoneum causing an overproduction of ascitic fluid which causes the abdomen to swell as fluid accumulates. It is more likely to\ndevelop in patients who have ovarian, uterine, cervical, colorectal, stomach, pancreatic, breast and liver cancers. In most patients,\ndevelopment of malignant ascites is a sign of advanced disease and poor prognosis. Malignant ascites can result in impairment to the quality\nof life of a cancer patient. In addition to abdominal distention, pain and difficulty breathing, it may also cause nausea, vomiting, early\nsatiety, lower extremity edema, weight gain and reduced mobility. These symptoms can interfere with a patient\u2019s ability to eat,\nto walk and to perform daily activities. They also reduce a patient\u2019s ability to withstand anti-cancer therapies, potentially reducing\nsurvival.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are developing a therapy to delay the production\nand accumulation of malignant ascites using our cancer therapy (i.e., ifosfamide converting encapsulated live cells). Preclinical studies\nare underway in Germany, and, if successful, we plan to seek FDA approval to conduct a Phase 1 study. Typical treatments for malignant\nascites include paracentesis, percutaneously implanted catheters, peritoneal ports and peritoneovenous shunts. These treatments can be\npainful, ineffective and expensive. There is currently no available treatment that delays the production and accumulation of malignant\nascites fluid, and we know of no competitors in this area.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMaterial Agreements\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThird Addendum to\nthe SG Austria APA\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn June 2013, we and SG Austria entered the Third\nAddendum and the Clarification Agreement.

We have paid the full amount of the manufacturing setup fee.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Manufacturing Framework Agreement also requires\nus to pay a fee for producing the final encapsulated cell product of $647 per vial of 300 capsules after production, with a minimum purchased\nbatch size of 400 vials of any Cell-in-a-Box\u00ae\u00a0product. The fees under the Manufacturing Framework Agreement are subject to annual\nincreases according to the annual inflation rate in the country in which the encapsulated cell products are manufactured. We placed and\nhave received an order to produce 400 vials for our clinical trial to treat LAPC. Austrianova has been paid the full amount for the order.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Third Addendum also requires us to make future\nroyalty and milestone payments as follows:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nTwo percent royalty on all gross sales received by us or our affiliates;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nTen percent royalty on gross revenues received by us or our affiliates from a sublicense or right to use the patents or the licenses granted by us or our affiliates;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nMilestone payments of $100,000 within 30 days after enrollment of the first human patient in the first clinical trial for each product; $300,000 within 30 days after enrollment of the first human patient in the first Phase 3 clinical trial for each product; and $800,000 within 60 days after having a NDA or a BLA approved by the FDA or a MAA approved by the EMA in Europe, or its equivalent based on the country in which it is accepted for each product; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nMilestone payments of $50,000 due 30 days after enrollment of the first veterinary patient in the first trial for each product and $300,000 due 60 days after having a BLA, a NDA or a MAA or its equivalent approved based on the country in which it is accepted for each veterinary product.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn May 14, 2018, we entered into amendments to\nthe Third Addendum.

Austrianova is the sole source of our product candidates. Austrianova is responsible for acquiring all of the necessary\nraw materials used in this process, including the cellulose sulfate necessary for encapsulating the live cells, a process proprietary\nto Austrianova. Austrianova from time to time has experienced significant supply chain delays, and we believe Austrinova may also be experiencing\nliquidity issues as well.

Although we believe we take reasonable measures to protect our intellectual property and trade\nsecrets and those of Austrianova, we cannot guarantee we will be able to protect and enforce our IP or obtain patent protection for our\nproduct candidates as needed. We license technology and trademarks relating to three areas: (i) live cell encapsulation with cells that\nexpress cytochrome P450 where the capsule is permeable to prodrug molecules and the cells are retained within the capsules; (ii) treatment\nof solid cancerous tumors and (ii) encapsulation of cells for producing retroviral particles for gene therapy.

The restructuring resulted in us focusing our efforts developing a\nnovel, effective and safe way to treat cancer and diabetes. In January 2015, we changed our name from Nuvilex, Inc. to PharmaCyte Biotech,\nInc. to reflect the nature of our current business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur corporate headquarters are located at 3960\nHoward Hughes Parkway, Suite 500, Las Vegas, Nevada 89169. Our telephone number is (917) 595-2850. We maintain a website at \nwww.pharmacyte.com\n\nto which we post copies of our press releases as well as additional information about us. Our filings with the SEC are available free\nof charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after being electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Information\ncontained in our website is not a part of, nor incorporated by reference into, this Report or our other filings with the SEC, and should\nnot be relied upon.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGovernment Regulation and Product Approval\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs a development-stage biotechnology company that\noperates in the U.S., we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The federal\nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d) and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the\nresearch, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting,\ndistribution, import, export, advertising, promotion, marketing and sale of our product candidates. Although the discussion below focuses\non regulation in the U.S., we anticipate seeking approval for, and marketing of, our product candidates in other countries. Our activities\nin other countries will also be the subject of extensive regulation, although there can be important differences with the U.S. The process\nof obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes\nand regulations will require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and may not be successful.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRegulatory approval, when obtained, may be limited\nin scope which may significantly limit the uses for which a product may be placed in the market. Further, approved drugs or biologic products,\nas well as their manufacturers, are subject to ongoing post-marketing review, inspection and discovery of previously unknown issues regarding\nthe safety and efficacy of such products or the manufacturing or quality control procedures used in their production. These may result\nin restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market. Any failure or delay by us, our suppliers of\nmanufactured drug product, collaborators or licensees in obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our product\ncandidates and our ability to receive product revenue, license revenue or profit-sharing payments.

Pharmaceutical\nproducts and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. A failure to comply with any requirements\nduring the product development, approval, or post-approval periods, may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions\ncould include the imposition by the FDA or by an Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d) of a hold on clinical trials, refusal\nto approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures,\ntotal or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe steps required before a new drug or biologic\nmay be marketed in the U.S. generally include:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\ncompletion of preclinical studies and formulation\nstudies in compliance with the FDA\u2019s Good Laboratory Practices (\u201cGLP\u201d), protocols and regulations;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nsatisfactory completion of an FDA inspection\nof the manufacturing facilities at which the investigational product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and proof that\nthe facilities, methods and controls are adequate;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nsubmission to the FDA of an IND to support human\nclinical testing in the U.S.;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\napproval by an IRB at each clinical site before\na trial may be initiated at that site;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nperformance of adequate and well-controlled clinical\ntrials in accordance with federal regulations and with Good Clinical Practices (\u201cGCP\u201d) to establish the safety and efficacy\nof the investigational product candidate for each target indication;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nSubmission to the FDA of a New Drug Application\n(\u201cNDA\u201d) or a drug or Biologics License Application (\u201cBLA\u201d) for a biologic such as the therapies we are developing;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nsatisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee\nreview, if applicable; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nFDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nClinical Development\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBefore a drug or biologic product may be given\nto humans, it must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of a product candidate\u2019s chemical\nand biological activities and animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy in humans. The results of these studies must be submitted\nto the FDA as part of an IND which must be reviewed by the FDA for safety and other considerations before testing can begin in humans.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn IND is a request for authorization from the\nFDA to administer an investigational product candidate to humans. This authorization is required before interstate shipping and administration\ncan commence of any new drug or biologic product destined for use in humans in the U.S. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of\neach IND is required before commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within\nthis 30-day period after submission of the IND, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. A clinical trial involves the administration\nof the investigational product candidate to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators following GCP standards. These international\nstandards are meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and\nmonitors. A clinical trial is conducted under protocols that detail the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria\nto be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part\nof the IND.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n16\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe product candidates in our pipeline are at\nvarious stages of preclinical development. The path to regulatory approval includes three phases of clinical trials in which we collect\ndata to support an application to regulatory agencies to allow us to ultimately market a product for treatment of a specified disease.\nThere are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in research and development of new products, and these can conceivably result in\na high rate of failure. To bring a drug or biologic from the discovery phase to regulatory approval, and ultimately to market, takes years\nand the costs to do so are significant. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after the product is approved, based\non post-marketing factors. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited\ncommercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved\nuses, reimbursement challenges, difficulty or excessive costs of manufacture, alternative therapies or infringement of the patents or\nintellectual property rights of others. Uncertainties in the approval process of the regulatory agencies can result in delays in product\nlaunches and lost market opportunities. Consequently, it is exceedingly difficult to predict which products will ultimately be submitted\nfor approval, which have the highest likelihood of obtaining approval and which will be commercially viable and generate profits. Successful\nresults in preclinical or clinical studies may not be an accurate predictor of the ultimate safety or effectiveness of a product candidate.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPhase 1 Clinical Trial\n: A Phase 1 clinical\ntrial begins when a regulatory agency, such as the FDA, allows initiation of the clinical investigation of a new product candidate. The\nclinical trial studies a product candidate\u2019s safety profile and may include a preliminary determination of a product candidate\u2019s\nsafe dosage range. The Phase 1 clinical trial can also determine how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted by the\nbody and, therefore, the potential duration of its action.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPhase 2 Clinical Trial\n: A Phase 2 clinical\ntrial is conducted on a limited number of patients; these patients can have a specific targeted disease. An initial evaluation of the\nproduct candidate\u2019s effectiveness on patients is performed. Additional information on the product candidate\u2019s safety and dosage\nrange is obtained. For many diseases, a Phase 2 clinical trial can include up to several hundred patients.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPhase 3 Clinical Trial\n: A Phase 3 clinical\ntrial is typically rigorously controlled, conducted in multiple centers and involves a larger target patient population that can consist\nof from several hundred to thousands of patients (depending on the disease being studied) to ensure that study results are statistically\nsignificant. During a Phase 3 clinical trial, physicians monitor patients to determine efficacy and to gather further information on safety.\nA Phase 3 clinical trial is designed to generate all the clinical data necessary to apply for marketing approval to a regulatory agency.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe decision to terminate development of an investigational\nproduct candidate may be made by either a health authority body, such as the FDA, by IRB/ethics committees, or by the sponsor for various\nreasons. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it\nbelieves that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to\nthe patients enrolled in the trial. In some cases, a clinical trial is overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized\nby the trial sponsor, or the clinical monitoring board. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated\ncheckpoints. These decisions are based on the limited access to data from the ongoing trial. The suspension or termination of development\ncan occur during any phase of a clinical trial if it is determined that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.\nThere are also requirements for the registration of an ongoing clinical trial of a product candidate on public registries and the disclosure\nof certain information pertaining to the trial, as well as clinical trial results after completion.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA sponsor may be able to request a special protocol\nassessment (\u201cSPA\u201d), the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design\nand analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. A sponsor meeting the regulatory criteria may make a specific request\nfor a SPA and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. A SPA request must be made before the\nproposed trial begins. All open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented\nand made part of the record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial\nbegins, except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential\nto determining the safety or efficacy of the product candidate was identified after the testing began. A SPA is not binding if new circumstances\narise, and there is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to a SPA.\nHaving a SPA does not guarantee that a product candidate will receive FDA approval.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n17\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAssuming successful completion of all required\ntesting in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational product candidate information is submitted\nto the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA to request regulatory approval for the product in the specified indication.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNew Drug Applications and Biologic Licensing\nApplications\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo obtain approval to market a drug or biologic\nin the U.S., a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the\nproduct candidate for the proposed indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies\nand clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating\nto the product\u2019s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, as well as the proposed labeling for the product, among other things. Data\ncan come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a product, or from several alternative\nsources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality\nand quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn most cases, the NDA, in the case of a drug,\nor BLA, in the case of a biologic, must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. There may be some instances in which the user fee is\nwaived. The FDA will initially review the NDA or BLA for completeness before it accepts the application for filing. The FDA has 60 days\nfrom its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency\u2019s threshold\ndetermination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the\nFDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. During a normal review\ncycle, a product is given an FDA action or Prescription Drug User Fee Act (\u201cPDUFA\u201d) date within 12 months of the submission\nif the submission is accepted. The FDA can extend this review by three months to consider certain late-submitted information or information\nintended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether\nthe proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP\nstandards. The FDA may refer applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory\ncommittee. This is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether\nthe application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but\nit considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBefore approving an NDA or a BLA, the FDA will\ninspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that\nthe manufacturing processes and facilities follow cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within\nrequired specifications. Manufacturers of human cellular or tissue-based biologics also must comply with the FDA\u2019s Good Tissue Practices\n(\u201cGTP\u201d), as applicable, and with the general biological product standards. After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the\nsponsor company\u2019s manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response\nletter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information for the FDA\nto reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction in a resubmission of\nthe NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA\nultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe time to final marketing approval can vary\nfrom months to years, depending on several variables. These variables can include such things as the disease type, the strength and complexity\nof the data presented, the novelty of the target or compound, risk-management approval and whether multiple rounds of review are required\nfor the agency to evaluate the submission. After evaluating the NDA or BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee\nrecommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval\nletter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions\nthat must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order\nfor FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application\ndoes not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction, the\nFDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific\nprescribing information, which may include contraindications, warnings or precautions, for certain indications. After approval, some types\nof changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements\nand FDA review and approval.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n18\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPost Approval Regulations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAfter regulatory approval of a drug or biologic\nis obtained, a company is required to comply with certain post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA\nor BLA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including a Phase 4 clinical trial and surveillance to further assess and monitor\nthe product\u2019s safety and effectiveness after commercialization has begun. Also, as a holder of an approved NDA or BLA, a company\nis required to: (i) report adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA; (ii) provide updated safety and efficacy information;\nand (iii) comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of its products. Also, quality control and\nmanufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP standards after approval to assure and preserve the long-term stability of the\ndrug or biological product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP standards, which imposes\nextensive procedural and substantive record keeping requirements. Also, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and,\ndepending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. In addition, FDA regulations require\ninvestigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP standards and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon a company\nand any third-party manufacturers that a company may decide to use. Manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in production\nand quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP standards and other aspects of regulatory compliance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDisclosure of Clinical Trial Information\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA sponsor of a clinical trial of certain FDA-regulated\nproducts, including prescription drugs and biologics, is required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public\nwebsite. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigator involved, and other\naspects of the clinical trial are made public as part of the registration. A sponsor is also obligated to disclose the results of a clinical\ntrial after completion. Disclosure of the results can be delayed until the product or new indication being studied has been approved.\nCompetitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertising and Promotion\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe FDA and other federal regulatory agencies\ntightly regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer\nadvertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities\ninvolving the internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include\nonly those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers\nare permitted to prescribe drugs or biologics for \u201coff-label\u201d uses (uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described\nin the drug\u2019s labeling) because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions\non manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off label uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a product for off-label\nuse, but may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding off-label use under specified conditions. Failure to comply with\napplicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA,\nthe U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the Office of the Inspector General of Health & Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d)\nand state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including\ncivil and criminal fines and/or agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug and biologics.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nU.S. Patent Extension and Marketing Exclusivity\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation\nAct (\u201cBPCIA\u201d) amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as\nbiosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to establish its product as highly like an approved\ninnovator biologic, among other requirements. The BPCIA bars the FDA from approving biosimilar applications for 12 years after an innovator\nbiological product receives initial marketing approval.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n19\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics\nof the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for limited patent term\nextension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (\u201cHatch-Waxman Act\u201d). The Hatch-Waxman\nAct permits a patent extension term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory\nreview process. However, patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product\u2019s\napproval date. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug, biologic or medical device is under\nregulatory review. It is calculated as half of the testing phase (the time between the IND submission becoming effective and the NDA,\nBLA or premarket approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) submission) and all the review phase (the time between NDA, BLA or PMA submission and approval)\nup to a maximum extension of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with\ndue diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension\nmust be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), in consultation with\nthe FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign\njurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, biologic or medical device. In the future, if any of our product\ncandidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extension on patents covering those products that may be eligible\nfor such patent term restoration.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d)\nprohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or\nindirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity to assist\nthe individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S.\nto comply with accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions\nof the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls\nfor international operations. In Europe, and throughout the world, other countries have enacted anti-bribery laws and/or regulations similar\nto the FCPA.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEuropean and Other International Government\nRegulation\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to regulations in the U.S., we will\nbe subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales\nand distribution of our product candidates. There is no guarantee that a potential treatment will receive marketing approval or that decisions\non marketing approvals or treatment indications will be consistent across geographic areas. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for\na product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical\ntrials or marketing of the product in those countries. Some countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process to that of the FDA in\nthat such countries require the submission of a clinical trial application (\u201cCTA\u201d) much like the IND prior to the commencement\nof human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must typically be submitted to each country\u2019s national health authority\nand an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and an IRB. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country\u2019s requirements,\na clinical trial may proceed in that particular country. In the EEA, the EU Clinical Trial Regulation (\u201cCTR\u201d) enables sponsors\nsince 31\u00a0January 2022 to submit one CTA via a single online platform, the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS), to obtain approval\nfor a clinical trial in several EEA countries.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo obtain regulatory approval to commercialize\na new drug or biologic under the European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (\u201cMAA\u201d)\nwith the European Medicines Agency, or \u201cEMA\u201d, the EEA authority in charge of medicinal products, or with a national drug approval\nauthority. National and European Union marketing authorization procedures are similar to FDA approval procedures.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile the requirements governing the conduct of\nclinical trials are broadly harmonized across the EEA, in particular due to the CTR, the regulatory regimes applicable to pricing and\nreimbursement vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with\nGCP standards, applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origin in the\nDeclaration of Helsinki.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n20\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOrphan Drug Status\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn accordance with laws and regulations pertaining\nto regulatory agencies, a sponsor may request that the regulatory agencies designate a drug or biologic intended to treat a \u201cRare\nDisease or Condition\u201d as an \u201cOrphan Drug.\u201d For example, in the U.S., a \u201cRare Disease or Condition\u201d is defined\nas one which affects less than 200,000 people in the U.S., or which affects more than 200,000 people but for which the cost of developing\nand making available the product is not expected to be recovered from sales of the product in the U.S. Upon the approval of the first\nNDA or BLA for a drug or biologic designated as an Orphan Drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of that NDA or BLA is entitled\nto 7 years of exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. for the drug or biologic for the particular indication unless the sponsor cannot\nassure the availability of sufficient quantities to meet the needs of persons with the disease. In Europe, this exclusivity is 10 years.\nHowever, Orphan Drug status for an approved indication does not prevent another company from seeking approval of a drug that has other\nlabeled indications that are not under orphan or other exclusivities. An Orphan Drug may also be eligible for federal income tax credits\nfor costs associated with the disease state, the strength and complexity of the data presented, the novelty of the target or compound,\nthe risk-management approval and whether multiple rounds of review are required for the agency to evaluate the submission. There is no\nguarantee that a potential treatment will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or treatment indications\nwill be consistent across geographic areas. Our product candidate for pancreatic cancer received Orphan Drug status in the U.S. and European\nUnion. Unlike the U.S., in the European Union, to benefit from market exclusivity, a medicine must maintain its orphan designation at\nthe time of marketing authorization in addition to when the designation is applied.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSpecial FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe FDA has various programs, including fast track\ndesignation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the\nprocess for the development and FDA review of drugs or biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases\nor conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new\ndrugs or biologics to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo be eligible for a fast-track designation, the\nFDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition\nand demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need\nif it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy\nor safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA or BLA for a fast-track product on a rolling basis before the complete application\nis submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections\nof the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first\nsection of the NDA or BLA.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe FDA may give a priority review designation\nto drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that\nthe goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines.\nUnder the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten-month review periods are measured from the \u201cfiling\u201d date rather than the\nreceipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision\nfrom the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast-track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to\nreceive a priority review.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n21\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, products tested for their safety\nand effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments\nmay be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing\nthat the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint\nthat can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible\nmorbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability\nor lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval\nto perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject\nto accelerated withdrawal procedures.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, under the provisions of the Food and\nDrug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate\nas a \u201cbreakthrough therapy.\u201d A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one\nor more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the\ndrug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial\ntreatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated\napproval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development\nand review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven if a product qualifies for one or more of\nthese programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period\nfor FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccelerated Approval Pathway\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug\nfor a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based\nupon a determination that the drug or biologic has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.\nThe FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that\ncan be measured earlier than an effect on IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, considering\nthe severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated\napproval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate\nendpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict\nclinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly\nthan clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely\nto predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on\nintermediate clinical endpoints but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic\neffect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding\nthat the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe accelerated approval pathway is most often\nused in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical\nbenefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has\nbeen used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally\nto improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to\ndemonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n22\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent\non a sponsor\u2019s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe\nthe drug\u2019s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance\nrequirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure\nto conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw\nthe drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are\nsubject to prior review by the FDA.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nUnder a centralized procedure in the European\nUnion, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA is 210 days (excluding \u201cclock stops,\u201d when additional written or\noral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use\n(\u201cCHMP\u201d)). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, for example, when a medicinal product\nis expected to be of a major public health interest, which takes into consideration: (i) the seriousness of the disease (e.g., heavy disabling\nor life-threatening diseases) to be treated; (ii) the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and\n(iii) anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150\ndays.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHealthcare Reform\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe United States and many foreign jurisdictions\nhave enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The United States government, state legislatures\nand foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid\nhealthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded\nprescription drugs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly\npassed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement\nconstraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases,\ndesigned to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare\nreform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare\nproducts and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or\nadditional pricing pressures. \nCoverage and Reimbursement\n Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status\nof any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which\nwe receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party\npayors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.\nThe process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the\nprice or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products\non an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all the FDA-approved drugs for a certain indication. Third-party payors are\nincreasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition\nto their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness\nof our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates, if approved, may not be\nconsidered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that\nan adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price\nlevels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n23\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDifferent pricing and reimbursement schemes exist\nin other countries. In the European Union governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement\nrules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions\noperate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon.\nTo obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness\nof a product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but\nmonitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become\nmore intense.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe marketability of any product for which we\nreceive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage\nand reimbursement. Also, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on\npharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement\nstatus is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement\nrates may be implemented in the future.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOther U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the U.S., our activities are potentially subject\nto additional regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions of\nthe HHS and its Office of Inspector General, the Office for Civil Rights that has jurisdiction over matters relating to individuals\u2019\nprivacy and protected health information, the DOJ, individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ and state and local governments.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among\nother things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or\nin return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable\nunder Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare program. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted broadly to proscribe\narrangements and conduct where only one purpose of the remuneration between the parties was to induce or reward referrals. The term remuneration\nhas been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers, on one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exemptions\nand regulatory safe harbors protecting some business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly\nand practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they\ndo not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all the criteria for safe harbor protection from\nfederal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. Failure to meet all the requirements of an applicable safe harbor or statutory exemption, however,\ndoes not make the arrangement or conduct \nper se\n unlawful under the Anti-Kickback Statute; instead, in such cases, the legality\nof the arrangement would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a consideration of all the facts and circumstances to ascertain\nthe parties\u2019 intent. Moreover, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter\nstandard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have\ncommitted a violation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, the Affordable Care Act codified\ncase law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false\nor fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, as discussed below. The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes\npenalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to\na federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or\nfraudulent.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n24\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits any person\nfrom knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using\nor causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Through a\nmodification made to the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes \u201cany request or demand\u201d for money or\nproperty presented to the U.S. government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly\nproviding free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies\nhave been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies\u2019 marketing of the product for unapproved\u2014and\nthus non-reimbursable\u2014uses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability\nAct of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme\nto defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or\ncovering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment\nfor healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have additional similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply\nto items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the type of payor.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, we may be subject to data privacy\nand security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health\nInformation Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d) and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements\nrelating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA\u2019s\nprivacy and security standards directly applicable to \u201cbusiness associates,\u201d such as independent contractors or agents of\ncovered entities that receive or obtain protected health information with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also\nincreased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons.\nIt also gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal\nHIPAA laws and seek attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with pursuing these actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy\nand security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have\nthe same effect \u2013 thus complicating compliance efforts.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be subject to other state and federal privacy\nlaws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security, laws that\nplace specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting, and laws requiring holders of personal\ninformation to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach. EEA countries, the United Kingdom, Switzerland\nand other jurisdictions have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the EEA, the collection and use of personal\ndata, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). The\nGDPR became effective on May 25, 2018, repealing its predecessor directive and increasing responsibility and liability of pharmaceutical\nand medical device companies in relation to the processing of personal data of EU data subjects. The GDPR, together with national legislation,\nregulations and guidelines of the EU member states governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions\non the ability to collect, use and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In\nparticular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information\nprovided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EEA, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality\nof the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. The United Kingdom\nhas retained the GDPR following Brexit and supplemented it by the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (\u201cUK GDPR\u201d). National or local\ndata protection laws or regulations may apply in addition to the (UK) GDPR. Furthermore, European data protection authorities may interpret\nthe (UK) GDPR and national or local laws differently, and they may impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing\npersonal data in or from the EEA or United Kingdom. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise\nrevised.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n25\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under\nthe Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations also require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical\nsupplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions,\nto report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians, certain other health\ncare professionals, and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians,\nhealth care professionals, and teaching hospitals. It also requires reporting annually certain ownership and investment interests held\nby physicians and their immediate family members and payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to such physician owners.\nFailure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to, as adjusted\nin 2021, an aggregate of $189,692 per year and up to an aggregate of $1,264,622 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d. Manufacturers\nwere required to begin collecting data on August 1, 2013, and submit reports on aggregate payment data to the government for the first\nreporting period of August 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013, by March 31, 2014. They are also required to report detailed payment data for\nthe first reporting period and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data by June 30, 2014. Thereafter, manufacturers must\nsubmit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. CMS made all reported data publicly available starting on September 30,\n2014. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose additional restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer\nmarketing practices and/ or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and\nentities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness\nof available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under\none or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other\ngovernmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties. These include criminal and civil monetary penalties, damages,\nfines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial\nsuspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private \u201cqui tam\u201d actions brought by individual\nwhistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter supply contracts and the curtailment or restructuring of\nour operations. Any of these could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent any\nof our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance,\napplicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance\nprograms and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nControlled Substances Regulation\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur product candidates involving \nCannabis\n\ncontain controlled substances, as defined in the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (\u201cCSA\u201d). The CSA and its implementing\nregulations establish a \u201cclosed system\u201d of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security,\nrecordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the U.S.\nDrug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d). The DEA is the federal agency responsible for regulating controlled substances. It\nrequires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply\nwith the regulatory requirements to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce. The DEA categorizes\ncontrolled substances into one of five schedules\u2014Schedule I, II, III, IV or V\u2014with varying qualifications for listing in each\nschedule. Although cannabis is legal in the State of North Carolina, we had to obtain a Schedule I license for our research with our research\nuniversity partner (University of Northern Colorado) that relies on federal grants. Schedule I substances have a high potential for abuse,\nhave no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the U.S. and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. They may be\nused only in federally approved research programs and may not be marketed or sold for dispensing to patients in the U.S. Pharmaceutical\nproducts having a currently accepted medical use that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V\nsubstances, with Schedule I substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence. Schedule V\nsubstances present the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence. The regulatory requirements are more restrictive for Schedule\nII substances than Schedule III substances. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically\npresented to a pharmacist in most situations and cannot be refilled. Following FDA approval of a drug containing a Schedule I controlled\nsubstance, that substance must be rescheduled as a Schedule II, III, IV or V substance before it can be marketed. On November 17, 2015,\nH.R. 639, Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act, passed through both houses of Congress. On November 25, 2015,\nthe bill was signed into law. The law removes uncertainty associated with timing of the DEA rescheduling process after FDA approval. Specifically,\nit requires DEA to issue an \u201cinterim final rule,\u201d pursuant to which a manufacturer may market its product within 90 days of\nFDA approval. The law also preserves the period of orphan marketing exclusivity for the full seven years such that this period only begins\nafter DEA scheduling. This contrasts with the previous situation whereby the orphan \u201cclock\u201d began to tick upon FDA approval,\neven though the product could not be marketed until DEA scheduling was complete.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n26\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFacilities that manufacture, distribute, import\nor export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the location, activity and\ncontrolled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are required for importation and manufacturing activities, and each\nregistration authorizes which schedules of controlled substances the registrant may handle. However, certain coincident activities are\npermitted without obtaining a separate DEA registration, such as distribution of controlled substances by the manufacturer that produces\nthem.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities\nto review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security\nrequirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent\nrequirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks\non employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm\nsystems and surveillance cameras. An application for a manufacturing registration as a bulk manufacturer for a Schedule I or II substance\nmust be published in the Federal Register and is open for 30 days to permit interested persons to submit comments, objections or requests\nfor a hearing. A copy of the notice of the Federal Register publication is forwarded by DEA to all those registered, or applicants for\nregistration, as bulk manufacturers of that substance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOnce registered, manufacturing facilities must\nmaintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic\nreports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances and other designated\nsubstances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses and must obtain authorization to destroy\nor dispose of controlled substances. As with applications for registration as a bulk manufacturer, an application for an importer registration\nfor a Schedule I or II substance must also be published in the Federal Register, which remains open for 30 days for comments. Imports\nof Schedule I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from a\ndomestic supplier or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration,\nimporters and exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I and II substance or Schedule III, IV and V narcotic,\nand submit import or export declarations for Schedule III, IV and V non-narcotics. In some cases, Schedule III non-narcotic substances\nmay be subject to the import/export permit requirement, if necessary, to ensure that the U.S. complies with its obligations under international\ndrug control treaties.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor drugs manufactured in the U.S., the DEA establishes\nannually an aggregate quota for substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the U.S. based on the DEA\u2019s\nestimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific research and industrial needs. This limited aggregate amount of\n\nCannabis\n that the DEA allows to be produced in the U.S. each year is allocated among individual companies, which, in turn, must\nannually apply to the DEA for individual manufacturing and procurement quotas. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active\npharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual manufacturing\nor procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether to make such adjustments\nfor individual companies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe states also maintain separate controlled substance\nlaws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution and dispensing requirements. State authorities, including\nboards of pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements,\nparticularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations,\nor initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n27\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSmaller Reporting\nCompany\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe qualify as a smaller reporting company in accordance\nwith Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, and have elected to follow certain of the scaled back disclosure accommodations within this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinancial Information Concerning Geographic\nAreas\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe had no revenues in the fiscal years ended April\n30, 2023, and 2022, including no revenues from foreign countries.

Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and unless required by law, we expressly disclaim\nany obligation or undertaking to publicly update any of them in light of new information, future events, or otherwise.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSummary of Risks Associated with Our Business\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you\nshould consider before investing in our company. These risks are described in more detail in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nin Item 1A of this Report. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nWe are a biotechnology company with limited resources, a limited operating history and no products approved for clinical trials or commercial sale, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future success and viability.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nAs a result of the clinical hold that has been placed on our IND by the FDA, it has taken and may continue to take considerable time and expense to respond to the FDA, and no assurance can be given that the FDA will remove the clinical hold in which case our business and prospects will likely suffer material adverse consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nWe contract with Austrianova for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials, if allowed to proceed, and expect to continue to do so for commercialization.

We have limited\nresources, a limited operating history, no products approved for clinical trials or commercial sale and therefore have not produced any\nrevenues. We have generated significant operating losses since our inception. Our net losses for the years ended April 30, 2023, and 2022\nwere approximately $4.3 million and $4.2 million, respectively. As of April 30, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $116\nmillion. Substantially all our losses have resulted from expenses incurred relating to our research and development programs and from\ngeneral and administrative expenses and operating losses associated with our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses\nand operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate these losses will increase as we continue our research and development\nof, and, if approved by the FDA, commence clinical trials for, our product candidates. In addition to budgeted expenses, we may encounter\nunforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have no facilities to conduct fundamental research\nand we have performed our research and development activities by collaboration with contract service providers, and contract manufacturers\nand by designing and developing research programs in collaboration with university-based experts who work with us to evaluate mechanism(s)\nof disease for which we have designed and developed product candidates. We have not maintained a principal laboratory or primary research\nfacility for the development of our product candidates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBiotechnology product development is a highly\nuncertain undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We have not commenced or completed clinical trials for any of our product\ncandidates, obtained marketing approval for any product candidates, manufactured a commercial scale product, or arranged for a third party\nto do so on our behalf, or conducted sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Given the highly\nuncertain nature of biotechnology product development, we may never commence or complete clinical trials for any of our product candidates,\nobtain marketing approval for any product candidates, manufacture a commercial scale product or arrange for a third party to do so on\nour behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur limited operating history as a company makes\nany assessment of our future success and viability subject to significant uncertainty. We will encounter risks and difficulties frequently\nexperienced by early-stage biotechnology companies in rapidly evolving fields, and we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully\novercome such risks and difficulties. If we do not address these risks and difficulties successfully, our business, operating results\nand financial condition will suffer.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n31\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs a result of the clinical hold that has\nbeen placed on our IND by the FDA, it has taken and may continue to take considerable time and expense to respond to the FDA and no assurance\ncan be given that the FDA will remove the clinical hold in which case our business and prospects will likely suffer material adverse consequences.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn October 1, 2020, we received notice from the\nFDA that it had placed our IND for a planned clinical trial in LAPC on clinical hold. As part of the clinical hold process, the FDA has\nasked for additional information, tasks to be performed by us and new preclinical studies and assays. It has taken and may continue to\ntake a considerable period of time, the length of which is not certain at this time, for us to conduct such tasks and preclinical studies\nand to generate and prepare the requested information. It is possible that the service providers that we will utilize for such work may\nhave considerable backlogs and/or are suffering from slowdowns as a result of COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions and may not be able\nto perform such work for an extended period of time. Even if we are able to fully respond to the FDA\u2019s requests, they may subsequently\nmake additional requests that we would need to fulfill prior to the lifting of the clinical hold and we may never be able to begin our\nclinical trial in LAPC, obtain regulatory approval or successfully commercialize our product candidates. An inability to conduct our clinical\ntrial in LAPC as a result of the clinical hold or otherwise, would likely force us to terminate our clinical development plans. It is\npossible that we will be unable to fully respond to the FDA in a satisfactory manner, and as a result the clinical hold may never be lifted.\nIf the clinical hold is not lifted or if the lifting takes an extended period of time, our business and prospects will likely suffer material\nadverse consequences.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe contract with Austrianova for the manufacture\nof our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials, if allowed to proceed, and expect to continue to do so for commercialization.\nThis reliance on Austrianova increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or such quantities\nat an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not currently own or operate manufacturing\nfacilities to produce our encapsulated live cell product candidates for cancer, diabetes and malignant ascites. We rely on and expect\nto continue to rely on Austrianova to manufacture supplies of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials, if allowed\nto proceed, as well as for commercial manufacture of our product candidates, and these must be maintained for us to receive marketing\napproval for our product candidates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur encapsulated live cell product candidates\nmust be manufactured through complex, multi-step synthetic processes that are time-consuming and involve special conditions at certain\nstages. Biologics and drug substance manufacture requires high potency containment, and containment under aseptic conditions. Any performance\nfailures on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates.\nMoreover, the facilities that produce our Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae \ncapsules are unique to us and would not be replicable or replaceable\npromptly, if at all, if those facilities become unavailable or are damaged or destroyed through an accident, natural disaster, labor disturbance\nor otherwise.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf Austrianova should become unavailable to us\nfor any reason, we may incur additional cost or delay in identifying or qualifying a replacement manufacturer. At this time, we are unaware\nof any available substitute manufacturer other than Austrianova. In addition, while we believe that our existing manufacturer, Austrianova,\ncan produce our product candidates, if approved, in commercial quantities, we may also need to identify a third-party manufacturer capable\nof providing commercial quantities of our product candidates. If we are unable to arrange for such a third-party manufacturing source\nor fail to do so on commercially reasonable terms and in a timely manner, we may not be able to successfully produce and market our encapsulated\nlive cell and ifosfamide product or any other product candidate or may be delayed in doing so.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven if we can establish such arrangements with\nanother third-party manufacturer, reliance on a new third-party manufacturer entails additional risks, including:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nReliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n32\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA new third-party manufacturer may not be able\nto comply with cGMP standards or the requirements of a regulatory agency. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturer,\nto comply with these practices or requirements could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including additional clinical holds, fines,\ninjunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates\nor products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product\ncandidates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDelays in the cGMP certification of the Austrianova\nmanufacturing facility in Bangkok, Thailand could affect its ability to manufacture encapsulated live cells on a timely basis and could\nadversely affect supplies of our product candidates for clinical trials and to market.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur product candidates that we may develop may\ncompete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers\nthat operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing products for us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, we expect to rely on Austrianova\nto purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our clinical studies, if allowed\nto proceed. There are a small number of suppliers for certain equipment and raw materials that are used in the manufacture of our product\ncandidates. Such suppliers may not sell these raw materials to Austrianova at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms.\nFor example, there is from time to time a limited supply of acceptable cell media for production of our MCB. We do not have any control\nover the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by Eurofins or Austrianova. Moreover, we currently do not have any\nagreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. Austrianova from time to time has experienced significant supply chain\ndisruptions, some of which may be related to COVID-19, and we believe it is experiencing liquidity issues. Any further significant delay\nin the supply of a product candidate or the raw material components thereof our clinical trials, if allowed to proceed, due to the need\nto replace a third-party supplier of these raw materials could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing\nand potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If Eurofins, Austrianova or we are unable to purchase these raw materials\nafter regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed\nor there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur current and anticipated future dependence\nupon Austrianova and others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability\nto commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDisruptions in the global economy and supply chains may have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the financial condition of the third parties\non which we rely, including Austrianova.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe disruptions to the global economy in recent\nyears have impeded global supply chains, resulting in longer lead times and also increased critical component costs and freight expenses.\nAustrianova, a third-party supplier on whom we rely, from time to time has experienced significant supply chain disruptions, some of which\nmay be related to COVID-19, and we believe it may be experiencing liquidity issues. Despite any actions we have undertaken to minimize\nthe impacts from disruptions to the global economy, there can be no assurances that unforeseen future events in the global supply chain,\ninflationary pressures, and delays our third parties face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe recent and ongoing COVID-19\npandemic could materially affect our operations, as well as the business or operations of third parties with whom we conduct business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of other future health pandemics in regions where we or third parties on which\nwe rely have significant business operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe face the ongoing risk that the coronavirus\npandemic may slow our operations, our preclinical studies or the eventual enrollment of our planned clinical trial. In order to prioritize\npatient health and that of the investigators at clinical trial sites, we may need monitor enrollment of patients in our clinical study.\nIn addition, some patients may be unwilling to enroll in our trials or be unable to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines\nor travel restrictions impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. These and other factors outside of our control could\ndelay our ability to conduct clinical trials or release clinical trial results. In addition, the effects of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic\nmay also increase non-trial costs such as insurance premiums, increase the demand for and cost of capital, increase loss of work time\nfrom key personnel, and negatively impact our key clinical trial vendors. We cannot guarantee that COVID-19 or any other public health\ncrisis will not cause delays or impact on our business or proposed clinical trial.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n33\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are unable to successfully\nraise additional capital, our future clinical trials and product development could be limited, and our long-term viability may be threatened.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have experienced negative operating cash flows\nsince our inception and have funded our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities. We may need to seek additional funds\nin the future through equity or debt financings, or strategic alliances with third parties, either alone or in combination with equity\nfinancings to complete our product development initiatives. These financings could result in substantial dilution to the holders of our\ncommon stock or require contractual or other restrictions on our operations or on alternatives that may be available to us. If we raise\nadditional funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities could impose significant restrictions on our operations. Any such required\nfinancing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, and the failure to procure such required financing could have\na material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or threaten our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur operating and capital requirements during\nthis fiscal year and thereafter will vary based on several factors, including whether we can complete the studies requested by the FDA\nwith respect to our IND filing, whether the FDA allows us to commence our planned clinical trial for LAPC, how quickly enrollment of patients\nin our such trial can be commenced, the duration of the clinical trial and any change in the clinical development plans for our product\ncandidates and the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and the EMA or other comparable\nforeign regulatory authorities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur present and future capital requirements will be significant and\nwill depend on many factors, including:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nour ability to complete the studies requested by the FDA with respect to our IND filing;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nwhether the FDA lifts the clinical hold on our IND filing for LAPC;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nthe progress and results of our development efforts for our product candidates;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nthe costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nmarket acceptance of our product candidates;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nthe rate of progress in establishing coverage and reimbursement arrangements with domestic and international commercial third-party payors and government payors;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nthe extent to which we acquire or in-license other products and technologies; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nlegal, accounting, insurance and other professional and business-related costs.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may not be able to acquire additional funds\non acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise adequate funds, we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets, or delay\nor reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our development programs. Further, if we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient\nfunds, we may be required to delay planned and future clinical trials, including the pig study, and development or commercialization of\nour product candidates. We also may have to reduce the resources devoted to our product candidates or cease operations. Any of these factors\ncould harm our operating results.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n34\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDue to the significant resources required for the development\nof our programs, and depending on our ability to access capital, we must prioritize development of certain product candidates. We may\nexpend our limited resources on programs that do not yield a successful product candidate and fail to capitalize on product candidates\nor indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe seek to maintain a process of prioritization\nand resource allocation to maintain an optimal balance between aggressively advancing lead programs and ensuring replenishment of our\nportfolio. Until such time, if ever, as the FDA lifts its clinical hold on our IND related to our planned clinical trial in LAPC, our\nCell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae\n encapsulation technology is validated in our planned clinical trial, and sufficient additional funding is\navailable, we have halted spending on behalf of our development program with respect to cannabinoids.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDue to the significant resources required for\nthe development of our programs, we must focus our programs on specific diseases and decide which product candidates to pursue and advance\nand the amount of resources to allocate to each. Our decisions concerning the allocation of research, development, collaboration, management\nand financial resources toward particular product candidates or therapeutic areas may not lead to the development of any viable commercial\nproduct and may divert resources away from better opportunities. Similarly, our potential decisions to delay, terminate or collaborate\nwith third parties in respect of certain programs may subsequently also prove to be suboptimal and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities.\nWe may fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities, be required to forego or delay pursuit of\nopportunities with other product candidates or other diseases that may later prove to have greater commercial potential than those we\nchoose to pursue, or relinquish valuable rights to such product candidates through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements\nin cases in which it would have been advantageous for us to invest additional resources to retain sole development and commercialization\nrights. If we make incorrect determinations regarding the viability or market potential of any or all of our programs or product candidates\nor misread trends in the biotechnology industry, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially\nadversely affected.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe currently have no commercial revenue\nand may never become profitable.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven if we can successfully achieve regulatory\napproval for our product candidates, we do not know what the reimbursement status of our product candidates will be or when any of these\nproducts will generate revenue for us, if at all. We have not generated, and do not expect to generate, any product revenue for the foreseeable\nfuture. We expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future due to the cost of our research and development,\npreclinical studies and clinical trials and the regulatory approval process for our product candidates. The amount of future losses is\nuncertain and will depend, in part, on the rate of growth of our expenses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur ability to generate revenue from our product\ncandidates also depends on numerous additional factors, including our ability to:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nsuccessfully complete development activities, including the remaining preclinical studies and planned clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\ncomplete and submit NDAs or BLAs to the FDA and MAAs to the EMA, and obtain regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial market;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\ncomplete and submit applications to, and obtain regulatory approval from, other foreign regulatory authorities;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nmanufacture any approved products in commercial quantities and on commercially reasonable terms;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\ndevelop a commercial organization, or find suitable partners, to market, sell and distribute approved products in the markets in which we have retained commercialization rights;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nachieve acceptance among patients, clinicians and advocacy groups for any products we develop;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nobtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third parties, including government payors; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nset a commercially viable price for any products for which we may receive approval.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n35\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are unable to predict the timing or amount\nof increased expenses, or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we can complete the processes described\nabove, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing our product candidates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo date, we have generated no revenue. Our ability\nto generate revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize,\nour product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire in the future.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering,\ndeveloping or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe development and commercialization of new drug\nproducts is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates. We will face competition with respect\nto any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. Such competition may arise from major pharmaceutical\ncompanies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are several large pharmaceutical and biotechnology\ncompanies that currently market products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for\nwhich we are developing our product candidates. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that\nare entirely different from our approach. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public\nand private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research,\ndevelopment, manufacturing and commercialization.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSpecifically, there are numerous companies developing\nor marketing therapies for cancer, diabetes and malignant ascites, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our\ncommercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective,\nhave fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors\nalso may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors\nestablishing a strong market position before we can enter the market.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMany of the companies against which we are competing\nor against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development,\nmanufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we\ndo. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors may result in even more resources being concentrated among\na smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly\nthrough collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining\nqualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well\nas in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur future revenues are unpredictable which\ncauses potential fluctuations in operating results.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause of our limited operating history as a\nbiotech company; we are currently unable to accurately forecast our revenues. Future expense levels will likely be based largely on our\nmarketing and development plans and estimates of future revenue. Any sales or operating results will likely generally depend on volume\nand timing of orders, which may not occur and on our ability to fulfill such orders, which we may not be able to do. We may be unable\nto adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues\nin relation to planned expenditures could have an immediate adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results\nof operations. Further, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, we may from time to time make certain pricing,\nservice or marketing decisions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n36\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in\nfuture operating results due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Factors that may affect operating results\ninclude: (i) the ability to obtain and retain customers; (ii) our ability to attract new customers at a steady rate and maintain customer\nsatisfaction with products; (iii) our announcement or introduction of new products by us or our competitors; (iv) price competition; (v)\nthe level of use and consumer acceptance of its products; (vi) the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating\nto expansion of the business, operations and infrastructure; (vii) governmental regulations; (viii) general economic conditions; (ix)\ndelays or disruptions in our supply chain; and (x) the adverse impacts caused by COVID-19.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are unable to obtain, or if there\nare delays in obtaining, required approval from the applicable regulatory agencies, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates\nand our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur product candidates must obtain marketing approval\nfrom the FDA for commercialization in the U.S. and from foreign regulatory agencies for commercialization in countries outside the U.S.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals in the countries in which we intend to sell and distribute our product candidates is expensive\nand can take many years if approval is obtained at all. This process can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including\nthe type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will\nprevent us from commercializing that product candidate. To date, we have not received approval to market any of our product candidates\nfrom regulatory agencies in any jurisdiction. We have no experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing\napprovals and expect to rely on third-party contract research organizations to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval\nrequires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the regulatory agencies for each product\ncandidate to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of\ninformation about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur product candidates may not be effective, may\nbe only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may\npreclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. Regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval\nprocess and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical,\nclinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay,\nlimit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes\nin or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may\nalso cause delays in or prevent the approval of an application. New cancer drugs frequently are indicated only for patient populations\nthat have not responded to an existing therapy or have relapsed after such therapies. If we experience delays in obtaining approval or\nif we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability\nto generate revenues will be materially impaired.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf allowed to proceed with our clinical\ndevelopment programs, we intend to conduct clinical trials for certain of our product candidates at sites outside of the U.S., and the\nU.S. regulatory agencies may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough the FDA may accept data from clinical\ntrials conducted outside the U.S., acceptance of this data is subject to certain conditions imposed by the regulatory agencies outside\nof the U.S. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance\nwith ethical principles. The trial population must also adequately represent the population in the country in which the clinical trial\nis being conducted. The data must be applicable to the U.S. population and medical practice in the U.S. in ways that the FDA deems clinically\nmeaningful. Generally, the patient population for any clinical trial conducted outside of the U.S. must be representative of the population\nfor whom we intend to seek approval in the U.S.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n37\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, while these clinical trials are subject\nto the applicable local laws, the FDA acceptance of the data will be dependent upon its determination that the trials also complied with\nall applicable U.S. laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept data from trials conducted outside of the\nU.S. If the FDA does not accept the data from any of our clinical trials that we determine to conduct outside the U.S., it would likely\nresult in the need for additional trials that would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt the development of our\nproduct candidate.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, the conduct of clinical trials outside\nthe U.S. could have a significant impact on us. Risks inherent in conducting international clinical trials include:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nForeign regulatory requirements that could restrict or limit our ability to conduct our clinical trials;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nAdministrative burdens of conducting clinical trials under multiple foreign regulatory schemes;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nForeign exchange fluctuations; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nDiminished protection of intellectual property in some countries.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur plan to first pursue a clinical trial\nbefore a pivotal Phase 3 trial will likely result in additional costs to us and resultant delays in the FDA review process and any future\ncommercialization and marketing if regulatory approval is obtained.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf the FDA allows us to begin a clinical trial\nby lifting its clinical hold on our IND, we have determined that the data contained in previous clinical trial reports using the Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae\n\nand its Associated Technologies are not enough to advance the program to a Phase 3 pivotal trial. Therefore, we are designing a\nclinical trial that, if successful, we believe will provide the information necessary to plan a Phase 3 pivotal trial. Our determination\nto first conduct a clinical trial before conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial will likely result in additional costs to us and\nresultant delays in the regulatory review process and any future commercialization and marketing if regulatory approval is obtained. The\nsame is true to a greater extent if the FDA requires us to commence a Phase 1 or other Phase 2 clinical trial instead of the planned Phase\n2b clinical trial currently under clinical hold.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are unable to obtain, or if there\nare delays in obtaining, required approval from the regulatory agencies, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates and\nour ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur product candidates must obtain marketing approval\nfrom the FDA for commercialization in the U.S. and from foreign regulatory agencies for commercialization in countries outside the U.S.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals in the countries in which we intend to sell and distribute our product candidates is expensive\nand can take several years if approval is obtained at all.

If we experience delays in obtaining approval or\nif we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability\nto generate revenues will be materially impaired.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment of a biologic involves a lengthy\nand expensive process with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing or be unable to complete\nthe development and commercialization of our product candidates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae\n and ifosfamide\ncombination product candidate has not begun clinical development, and, like others\u2019 candidates in a similar phase of development,\nthe risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when or if this product candidate or any other product candidate will prove effective\nor safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory agencies for the sale of any\nproduct candidate, if allowed to proceed, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate\nthe safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take\nseveral years to complete and are uncertain as to their outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of a\nclinical trial. The clinical development of our product candidates is susceptible to the risk of failure inherent at any stage of drug\ndevelopment, including failure to demonstrate efficacy in a clinical trial or across a broad population of patients, the occurrence of\nsevere or medically or commercially unacceptable adverse events, failure to comply with protocols or applicable regulatory requirements\nor determination by the regulatory agencies that a drug or biologic product is not approvable. It is possible that even if one or more\nof our product candidates has a beneficial effect, that effect will not be detected during clinical evaluation because of one or more\nof a variety of factors, including the size, duration, design, measurements, conduct or analysis of our clinical trials. Conversely, because\nof the same factors, our clinical trials if allowed to proceed, may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is\ngreater than the actual positive effect, if any. Similarly, in our clinical trials if allowed to proceed, we may fail to detect toxicity\nof, or intolerability caused by, our product candidates, or mistakenly believe that our product candidates are toxic or not well tolerated\nwhen that is not, in fact, the case.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe outcome of preclinical studies and early and\nmid-phase clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not\nnecessarily predict overall results. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors have suffered significant setbacks\nin late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in earlier stages of development, and we cannot be certain that we will\nnot face similar setbacks.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe design of a clinical trial can determine whether\nits results will support approval of a product; however, flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical\ntrial is well advanced or completed. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a\nclinical trial to support marketing approval. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations\nand analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials\nhave nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for their product candidates. Even if we believe that the results of clinical trials\nfor our product candidates warrant marketing approval, the regulatory agencies may disagree and may not grant marketing approval of our\nproduct candidates or may require that we conduct initial clinical studies; the latter would require that we incur significantly increased\ncosts and would significantly extend the clinical development timeline for our product candidates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability\nin safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes\nin trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the\nclinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. Any Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial we\nmay conduct may not demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n39\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are seeking FDA approval to commence\nclinical trials in the U.S. of certain of our product candidates based on clinical data that was obtained in trials conducted outside\nthe U.S., and it is possible that the FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations or conducted nearly 20 years ago.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn support of our IND application to commence\na clinical trial in LAPC using genetically engineered live human cells encapsulated using our Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae \ntechnology\nin combination with ifosfamide we are relying on a Phase 1/2 clinical trial and a clinical trial previously conducted using the same technology\nin combination with ifosfamide between 1998 and 1999 and between 1999 and 2000, respectively. The Phase 1/2 clinical trial was carried\nout at the Division of Gastroenterology, University of Rostock, Germany, and the Phase 2 clinical trial was carried out at four centers\nin two countries in Europe: Berne, Switzerland, and in Rostock, Munich and Berlin, Germany.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough the FDA may accept data from clinical\ntrials conducted outside the U.S., acceptance of this data is subject to certain conditions imposed by the FDA. There is a risk that the\nFDA may not accept the data from the two previous trials. In that case, we may be required to conduct a Phase 1 or a Phase 1/2b clinical\ntrial rather than the planned Phase 2b clinical trial in LAPC, currently under clinical hold. This may result in additional costs to us\nand resultant delays in the regulatory review process and any future commercialization and marketing if regulatory approval is obtained.\nIt is not known whether the FDA would be likely to reject the use of such clinical data due to the significant time that has elapsed since\nthe earlier clinical trials were conducted or because the clinical trial material for our proposed clinical trial is different from that\nused in the earlier clinical trials because of cloning the cells used in the earlier trials and certain other modifications and improvements\nthat have been made to the Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae \ntechnology since the time of the earlier trials.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe intend to conduct clinical trials for\ncertain of our product candidates at sites outside of the U.S., and the U.S. regulatory agencies may not accept data from trials conducted\nin such locations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough the FDA may accept data from clinical\ntrials conducted outside the U.S., acceptance of this data is subject to certain conditions imposed by the regulatory agencies outside\nof the U.S. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance\nwith ethical principles.

Comparable regulatory agencies outside\nof the U.S., such as the EMA in the European Union, impose similar restrictions. We may never receive such approvals. We may be required\nto complete additional preclinical development and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in\nhumans before we will be able to obtain these approvals.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design\nand implement, can take many years to complete and is inherently uncertain as to outcome.

The previous Phase 1/2 and Phase 2 clinical trials had a relatively\nlimited number of patients in each trial. These trials resulted in outcomes that were not statistically significant and may not be representative\nof future results. In addition, interim results obtained after a clinical trial has commenced do not necessarily predict results in future\nclinical trials. Numerous companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage\nclinical trials even after achieving promising results in early-stage clinical development. Our clinical trials, if allowed to proceed,\nmay produce negative or inconclusive results and we may decide, or regulatory agencies may require us, to conduct additional clinical\ntrials. Moreover, clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their\nproduct candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain the approval\nfor their products by the regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n41\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we experience any unforeseen events in\nthe clinical trials of our product candidates, potential marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed\nor prevented.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during\nour clinical trials, if allowed to proceed, that could delay or prevent marketing approval of our product candidates, including:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nClinical trials of our product candidates may produce unfavorable or inconclusive results;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nWe may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs or candidates;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, patient enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nOur third-party contractors, including those manufacturing our product candidates, components, or ingredients thereof or conducting clinical trials on our behalf, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner or at all;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nRegulators or IRBs may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nWe may experience delays in reaching or may fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nPatients who enroll in a clinical trial may misrepresent their eligibility to do so or may otherwise not comply with the clinical trial protocol, resulting in the need to drop the patients from the clinical trial, increase the needed enrollment size for the clinical trial or extend the clinical trial\u2019s duration;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nWe may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of a product candidate;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nRegulatory agencies or IRBs may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or their respective standards of conduct, a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of the product candidate or findings of undesirable effects caused by a chemically or mechanistically similar drug or drug candidate;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nRegulatory agencies may disagree with our clinical trial design or our interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nRegulatory agencies may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we enter agreements for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe supply or quality of raw materials or manufactured product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient, inadequate, delayed, or not available at an acceptable cost, or we may experience interruptions in supply; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe approval policies or regulations of the regulatory agencies may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient to obtain marketing approval.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n42\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProduct development costs for us will increase\nif we experience delays in testing or pursuing marketing approvals.

Significant preclinical study or\nclinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates\nor allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates\nand may harm our business and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, clinical trial delays may\nultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of any of our product candidates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we experience delays or difficulties\nin the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, we may not achieve our clinical development timeline and our receipt of necessary regulatory\napprovals could be delayed or prevented.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical\ntrials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll enough eligible patients to participate in our clinical trials.\nPatient enrollment is a significant factor in the overall duration of a clinical trial and is affected by many factors, including:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe size and nature of the patient population;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe severity of the disease under investigation;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe proximity of patients to clinical sites;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe eligibility criteria for the trial;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe design of the clinical trial;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nEfforts to facilitate timely enrollment;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nCompeting clinical trials for the same patient population; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nClinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages and risks of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur inability to enroll enough patients for our\nclinical trials could result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays\nin our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, delay or halt the development of and approval\nprocesses for our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to achieve our clinical development timeline and goals, including the\ndates by which we will commence, complete and receive results from clinical trials. Enrollment delays may also delay or jeopardize our\nability to commence sales and generate revenues from our product candidates. Any of the foregoing could cause the value of our company\nto decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may request priority review for our product\ncandidates in the future. The regulatory agencies may not grant priority review for any of our product candidates. Moreover, even if the\nregulatory agencies designated such products for priority review, that designation may not lead to a faster regulatory review or approval\nprocess and, in any event, does not assure approval by the regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be eligible for priority review designation\nfor our product candidates if the regulatory agencies determine such product candidates offer major advances in treatment or provide a\ntreatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review designation means that the time required for the regulatory agencies to\nreview an application is less than the standard review period. The regulatory agencies have broad discretion with respect to whether to\ngrant priority review status to a product candidate, so even if we believe a product candidate is eligible for such designation or status,\nthe regulatory agencies may decide not to grant it. Thus, while the regulatory agencies have granted priority review to other oncology\nand diabetes products, our product candidates, should we determine to seek priority review of them, may not receive similar designation.\nMoreover, even if one of our product candidates is designated for priority review, such a designation does not necessarily mean a faster\noverall regulatory review process or necessarily confer any advantage with respect to approval compared to conventional procedures of\nthe regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nReceiving priority review from the regulatory\nagencies does not guarantee approval within an accelerated timeline or thereafter.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n43\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn some instances, we believe we may be\nable to secure approval from the regulatory agencies to use accelerated development pathways. If we are unable to obtain such approval,\nwe may be required to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials beyond those that we contemplate which could increase\nthe expense of obtaining and delay the receipt of necessary marketing approvals.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe anticipate that we may seek an accelerated\napproval pathway for certain of our product candidates. Under the accelerated approval provisions or their implementing regulations of\nthe regulatory agencies, they may grant accelerated approval to a product designed to treat a serious or life-threatening condition that\nprovides meaningful therapeutic benefit over available therapies upon a determination that the product influences a surrogate endpoint\nor intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Regulatory agencies consider a clinical benefit\nto be a positive therapeutic effect that is clinically meaningful in the context of a given disease, such as irreversible morbidity or\nmortality. For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic\nimage, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. An\nintermediate clinical endpoint is a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality\nthat is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. The accelerated approval\npathway may be used in cases in which the advantage of a new drug over available therapy may not be a direct therapeutic advantage but\nis a clinically important improvement from a patient and public health perspective. If granted, accelerated approval is usually contingent\non the sponsor\u2019s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe\nthe drug\u2019s clinical benefit. If such post-approval studies fail to confirm the drug\u2019s clinical benefit, regulatory agencies\nmay withdraw their approval of the drug.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPrior to seeking such accelerated approval, we\nwill seek feedback from the regulatory agencies and will otherwise evaluate our ability to seek and receive such accelerated approval.\nThere can also be no assurance that after our evaluation of the feedback and other factors we will decide to pursue or submit an NDA,\na BLA or an MAA for accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review or approval. Similarly, there can be no assurance\nthat after subsequent feedback from regulatory agencies that we will continue to pursue or apply for accelerated approval or any other\nform of expedited development, review or approval, even if we initially decide to do so. Furthermore, if we decide to apply for accelerated\napproval or under another expedited regulatory designation (such as the Breakthrough Therapy designation or Fast Track designation), there\ncan be no assurance that such submission or application will be accepted or that any expedited development, review or approval will be\ngranted on a timely basis or at all. Regulatory agencies could also require us to conduct further studies prior to considering our application\nor granting approval of any type. A failure to obtain accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review or approval\nfor any of our product candidates that we determine to seek accelerated approval for would result in a longer time to commercialization\nof such product candidate, could increase the cost of development of such product candidate and could harm our competitive position in\nthe marketplace.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may seek Orphan Drug designation for\nsome of our product candidates, and we may be unsuccessful.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRegulatory agencies may designate drugs for relatively\nsmall patient populations as Orphan Drugs. Under the standards and requirements of regulatory agencies, they may designate a product as\nan Orphan Drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition. In the U.S., this is generally defined as a disease with\na patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals. If a product with an Orphan Drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing\napproval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes\nthe EMA or FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication during the period of exclusivity.\nThe applicable period is seven years in the U.S. and ten years in Europe. In Europe, a product must meet the orphan prevalence not only\nwhen so designated but at marketing authorization. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets\nthe criteria for Orphan Drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n44\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have been granted Orphan Drug designation for\nour pancreatic cancer therapy in the U.S. and European Union. Orphan Drug exclusivity may be lost if a regulatory agency determines that\nthe request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet\nthe needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Marketing exclusivity for a product designated as an Orphan Drug may not effectively\nprotect the product candidate from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition, and the same drug may be\napproved for a different condition that may be used off label for an orphan indication. Even after an Orphan Drug is approved and granted\nexclusivity, the regulatory agency can subsequently approve the same drug in a different drug product for the same condition if they conclude\nthat the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA Fast Track by the FDA or similar designation\nby another regulatory agency, even if granted for any of our product candidates, may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review\nor approval process and does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not currently have Fast Track designation\nby the FDA or similar designation by another regulatory agency for any of our product candidates but intend to seek such designation based\nupon the data generated from our clinical trials, if allowed to proceed and if successful. If a drug or biologic is intended for the treatment\nof a serious or life-threatening condition and the product candidate demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this\ncondition, the sponsor may apply for Fast Track designation by the FDA or similar designation by another regulatory agency. Regulatory\nagencies have broad discretion whether to grant this designation by the FDA or similar designation by another regulatory agency. Even\nif we believe a product candidate is eligible for this designation, we cannot assure you that a regulatory agency would decide to grant\nit. Even if we do receive Fast Track or similar designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared\nto conventional procedures adopted by a regulatory agency. In addition, a regulatory agency may withdraw Fast Track designation if it\nbelieves that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Many product candidates that have\nreceived Fast Track designation have failed to obtain marketing approval.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA Breakthrough Therapy designation by the\nFDA or similar designation by another regulatory agency, even if granted for any of our product candidates, may not lead to a faster development\nor regulatory review or approval process and does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not currently have Breakthrough Therapy\ndesignation by the FDA or similar designation by another regulatory agency for any of our product candidates but intend seek such designation\nbased upon the data we generate during our clinical trials, if successful.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA Breakthrough Therapy or similar designation\nis within the discretion of the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Accordingly, even if we believe, after completing early clinical trials,\nthat one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a Breakthrough Therapy or other similar designation, a regulatory\nagency may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy or other similar\ndesignation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs or biologics\nconsidered for approval under conventional procedures of a regulatory agency and does not assure their ultimate approval. In addition,\neven if one or more of our product candidates receives Breakthrough Therapy designation or other similar designations, a regulatory agency\nmay later decide that such product candidates no longer meet the conditions for the designation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in\ninternational jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo market and sell our product candidates in Europe\nand many other jurisdictions outside the U.S., we or our third-party collaborators must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply\nwith numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The\ntime required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval in the U.S. The regulatory approval\nprocess outside the U.S. generally includes all the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside\nthe U.S., it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We\nor these third parties may not obtain approval from a regulatory agency outside the U.S. on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by FDA\ndoes not ensure approval by a regulatory agency in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory agency outside the\nU.S. does not ensure approval by a regulatory agency in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for\nmarketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any market.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n45\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny product candidate for which we obtain\nmarketing approval will be subject to extensive post-marketing regulatory requirements and could be subject to post-marketing restrictions\nor withdrawal from the market. We may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated\nproblems with our products, when and if any of our product candidates are approved.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur product candidates and the activities associated\nwith their development and commercialization, including their testing, manufacture, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising,\npromotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by regulatory agencies. The requirements that result from such\nregulations include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP\nrequirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, including\nperiodic inspections by regulatory agencies, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, regulatory agencies may impose requirements\nfor costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product candidate. Regulatory\nagencies tightly regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics to ensure the products are marketed only for\nthe approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. They also impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019\ncommunications regarding use of their products. If we promote our product candidates beyond their approved indications, we may be subject\nto enforcement action for off-label promotion. Violations of the laws relating to the promotion of prescription drugs or biologics may\nlead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection\nlaws.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, later discovery of previously unknown adverse\nevents or other problems with our product candidates, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements,\nmay yield various results, including:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nRestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nRestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nRestrictions on product distribution or use;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nRequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nWarning or untitled letters or Form 483s;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nWithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nRefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nRecall of products;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nFines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nSuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nRefusal to permit the import or export of our product candidates;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nProduct seizure; or\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nInjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n46\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNon-compliance with European requirements regarding\nsafety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can\nalso result in significant financial penalties.

HIPAA, as amended\nby HITECH and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding\nthe privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Federal law requires applicable manufacturers\nof covered drugs to report payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, which includes data collection\nand reporting obligations. The information is to be made publicly available on a searchable website. Analogous state and foreign laws\nand regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving\nhealthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSome state laws require pharmaceutical companies\nto comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by\nthe federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians\nand other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information\nin some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating\ncompliance efforts.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements\nwith third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs.

If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we\nexpect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative\nsanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n47\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRecently enacted and future legislation\ncould increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the\nprices we may obtain.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe United States and many foreign jurisdictions\nhave enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that may affect our ability to profitably\nsell our product candidates, if approved. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant\ninterest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls,\nrestrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs and biologics.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was intended to broaden\naccess to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency\nrequirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional\nhealth policy reforms.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well\nas other healthcare reform measures that have and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional\ndownward pressure on the price that we receive for our product candidates, if approved, and could seriously harm our future revenues.\nAny reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from\nprivate payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate\nrevenue, attain and maintain profitability of our product candidates, if approved.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGovernments outside the U.S. tend to impose\nstrict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues, if any.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn some countries, particularly the EEA countries\nand the United Kingdom, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations\nwith governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement\nor pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product\ncandidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our product candidates is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if\npricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSerious adverse events or undesirable side\neffects or other unexpected properties of our encapsulated live cell plus ifosfamide product candidate or any of our other product candidates\nmay be identified during development that could delay or prevent the product candidates\u2019 marketing approval.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSerious adverse events or undesirable side effects\ncaused by, or other unexpected properties of, our product candidates could cause us, an IRB or a regulatory agency to interrupt, delay\nor halt clinical trials of one or more of our product candidates and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of\nmarketing approval by a regulatory agency. If any of our product candidates is associated with serious adverse events or undesirable side\neffects or has properties that are unexpected, we may need to abandon development or limit development of that product candidate to certain\nuses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable\nfrom a risk-benefit perspective. Many drugs that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to\ncause undesirable or unexpected side effects that prevented further development of the drug.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n48\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven if one of our product candidates receives\nmarketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third party payors and others in the\nmedical community necessary for commercial success and the market opportunity for the product candidate may be smaller than we anticipated.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have never commercialized a drug or biologic\nproduct. Even if one of our product candidates is approved by a regulatory agency for marketing and sale, it may nonetheless fail to gain\nsufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third party payors and others in the medical community. For example, physicians\nare often reluctant to switch their patients from existing therapies even when new and potentially more effective or convenient treatments\nenter the market. Further, patients often acclimate to the therapy that they are currently taking and do not want to switch unless their\nphysicians recommend switching products or they are required to switch therapies due to lack of reimbursement for existing therapies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEfforts to educate the medical community and third-party\npayors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may not be successful. If any of our product candidates\nis approved but does not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance, we may not generate significant revenues and we may not become\nprofitable.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe degree of market acceptance of our encapsulated\nlive cell plus ifosfamide product candidate or any of our other product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on several\nfactors, including:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe efficacy and safety of the product;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe potential advantages of the product compared to alternative treatments;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nWhether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nLimitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nOur ability to offer the product for sale at competitive prices;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nOur ability to establish and maintain pricing sufficient to realize a meaningful return on our investment;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe product\u2019s convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe willingness of the target patient population to try, and of physicians to prescribe, the product;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n49\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe strength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe approval of other new products for the same indications;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nChanges in the standard of care for the targeted indications for the product;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe timing of market introduction of our approved products as well as competitive products and other therapies;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nAvailability and amount of reimbursement from government payors, managed care plans and other third-party payors;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nAdverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nPotential product liability claims.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe potential market opportunities for our product\ncandidates are difficult to estimate precisely. Our estimates of the potential market opportunities are predicated on many assumptions,\nincluding industry knowledge and publications, third party research reports and other surveys. While we believe that our internal assumptions\nare reasonable, these assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment on the part of our management, are inherently uncertain\nand the reasonableness of these assumptions has not been assessed by an independent source. If any of the assumptions prove to be inaccurate,\nthe actual markets for our product candidates could be smaller than our estimates of the potential market opportunities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf any of our product candidates receives\nmarketing approval and we or others later discover that the therapy is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side\neffects that were not previously identified, our ability to market the therapy could be compromised.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nClinical trials of our product candidates, if\nallowed to proceed, will be conducted in carefully defined subsets of patients who have agreed to enter a clinical trial. Consequently,\nit is possible that our clinical trials, if allowed to proceed, may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is\ngreater than the actual positive effect, if any, or alternatively fail to identify undesirable side effects. If, following approval of\na product candidate, we or others discover that the product candidate is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable\nside effects that were not previously identified, any of the following adverse events could occur:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nA regulatory agency may withdraw its approval of the product candidate or seize the product candidate;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nWe may be required to recall the product candidate or change the way the product is administered;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nAdditional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of, or the manufacturing processes for, the product candidate;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nWe may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nA regulatory agency may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nWe may be required to create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of the previously unidentified side effects for distribution of our product candidate to patients;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nWe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe product candidate may become less competitive; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nOur reputation may suffer.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny of these events could have a material and\nadverse effect on our operations and business and could adversely impact our stock price.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n50\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing\nand distribution capabilities or enter acceptable sales, marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties, we may not be successful\nin commercializing any product candidate that we develop when a product candidate is approved.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not have any sales, marketing or distribution\ninfrastructure and have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success\nfor any approved product candidate, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization, outsource these functions to third parties\nor license our product candidates to others. If approved by the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory agencies, we expect to license\nour encapsulated live cell plus ifosfamide product candidate for pancreatic cancer to a large pharmaceutical company with greater resources\nand experience than us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may not be able to license our encapsulated\nlive cell plus ifosfamide product candidate on reasonable terms, if at all. If other product candidates are approved for smaller or easily\ntargeted markets, we expect to commercialize them in the U.S. directly with a small and highly focused commercialization organization.\nThe development of sales, marketing and distribution capabilities will require substantial resources and will be time-consuming, which\ncould delay any product candidate launch.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe expect that we will commence the development\nof these capabilities prior to receiving approval of any of our product candidates. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for\nwhich we recruit a sales force and establish marketing and distribution capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we could\nhave prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization costs. Such a delay may be costly, and our investment could be lost\nif we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, we may not be able to hire or retain\na sales force in the U.S. that is sufficient in size or has adequate expertise in the medical markets that we plan to target. If we are\nunable to establish or retain a sales force and marketing and distribution capabilities, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nIf a potential partner has development or commercialization expertise that we believe is particularly relevant to one of our product candidates,\nthen we may seek to collaborate with that potential partner even if we believe we could otherwise develop and commercialize the product\ncandidate independently.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe expect to seek one or more strategic partners\nfor commercialization of our product candidates outside the U.S. Because of entering arrangements with third parties to perform sales,\nmarketing and distribution services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues may be lower, perhaps substantially\nlower, than if we were to directly market and sell products in those markets. Furthermore, we may be unsuccessful in entering the necessary\narrangements with third parties or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, we may have little or no control\nover such third parties and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our product candidates\neffectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities,\neither on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing any of our product candidates that\nreceive marketing approval.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe rely heavily on third parties to conduct\nour preclinical studies and plan to rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, assuming they are allowed to proceed, and those\nthird parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such studies and trials.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe currently rely heavily on third parties to\nconduct our preclinical studies and plan to rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, assuming they are allowed to proceed,\nincluding Austrianova in which we own an equity interest. We expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties, such as a CRO, a clinical\ndata management organization, a medical institution, a clinical investigator and others to plan for and conduct our clinical trials. Our\nagreements with these third parties generally allow the third party to terminate our agreement with them at any time. If we are required\nto enter alternative arrangements because of any such termination, the introduction of our product candidates to market could be delayed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n51\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur reliance on these third parties for R&D\nactivities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we design our clinical\ntrials and will remain responsible for ensuring that each is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocol\nfor the trial. Moreover, regulatory agencies require us to comply with current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) for conducting,\nrecording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the\nrights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not\nrelieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of\ncompleted clinical trials on a government-sponsored database of regulatory agencies within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can\nresult in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, these third parties may also have\nrelationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual\nduties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with the requirements of a regulatory agency or our protocols,\nwe will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to,\nor may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, disruptions in the global economy\nand supply chains could adversely affect the financial conditions of the third parties on which we rely, resulting in delays in preclinical\nstudies and clinical trials that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For instance, Austrianova\nfrom time to time has experienced significant supply chain delays, some of which may be related to COVID-19, and we believe it may be\nexperiencing liquidity issues.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe rely on numerous consultants for a substantial\nportion of our R&D related to our product candidates. If there are delays or failures to perform their obligations, our product candidates\nwould be adversely affected. If our collaboration with these consultants is unsuccessful or is terminated, we would need to identify new\nresearch and collaboration partners for our preclinical and clinical development. If we are unsuccessful or significantly delayed in identifying\nnew collaboration and research partners, or unable to reach an agreement with such a partner on commercially reasonable terms, development\nof our product candidates will suffer, and our business would be materially harmed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, if any of these consultants change\ntheir strategic focus, or if external factors cause any one of them to divert resources from our collaboration, or if any one of them\nindependently develops products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates using resources or information it acquires\nfrom our collaboration, our business and results of operations could suffer.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFuture preclinical and clinical development\ncollaborations may be important to us. If we are unable to maintain these collaborations, or if these collaborations are not successful,\nour business could be adversely affected.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor some of our product candidates, we may in\nthe future determine to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for development of our product candidates. We face\nsignificant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for any collaboration will depend,\namong other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed\ncollaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of several factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable\ncollaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce\nor delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay our potential development schedule or increase\nour expenditures and undertake preclinical and clinical development activities at our own expense. If we fail to enter collaborations\nand do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development activities, we may not be able to further develop\nour product candidates or continue to develop our product candidates and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n52\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFuture collaborations we may enter may involve\nthe following risks:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nCollaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nCollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nChanges in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, may divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nCollaborators may delay discovery and preclinical development, provide insufficient funding for product development of targets selected by us, stop or abandon preclinical or clinical development of a product candidate or must repeat or conduct new preclinical and clinical development of a product candidate;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nCollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed than ours;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nProduct candidates may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the development of our product candidates;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nDisagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development might cause delays or termination of the preclinical or clinical development or commercialization of product candidates. This might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nCollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or intellectual property rights licensed to us or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nCollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nCollaborations may be terminated at the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of our product candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, subject to its contractual obligations\nto us, if a collaborator of ours is involved in a business combination, the collaborator might deemphasize or terminate the development\nof any of our product candidates. If one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract\nnew collaborators and our perception in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected. If we are unable to maintain\nour collaborations, development of our product candidates could be delayed, and we may need additional resources to develop them.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe rely on Prof. G\u00fcnzburg and Dr. Salmons\nfor the development of our product candidates. If they decide to terminate their relationship with us, we may not be successful in the\ndevelopment of our product candidates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe rely on Prof. Walter H. G\u00fcnzburg and Dr. Brian Salmons, officers\nof Austrianova, for the development of our product candidates. If they decide to terminate their relationship with us, we may not be successful\nin the development of our product candidates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProf. G\u00fcnzburg and Dr. Salmons are involved\nin almost all our scientific endeavors underway and being planned by us. These endeavors include preclinical and clinical studies involving\nour cancer therapy for LAPC to be conducted in the U.S. and elsewhere on our behalf. They also provide professional consulting services\nto us through the respective consulting agreements we have entered with the consulting companies through which they provide services.\nThe consulting agreements may be terminated for any reason at any time upon one party giving the other written notice prior to the effective\ndate of the termination. If that occurs, we may not be successful in the development of our product candidates which could have a material\nadverse effect on us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n53\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe manufacture of our product candidates\nis complex, and difficulties may be encountered in production. If such difficulties are encountered or failure to meet regulatory standards\noccurs, our ability to provide supply of our product candidates for clinical trials, if allowed to proceed, or our products for patients,\nif approved, could be delayed or stopped, or we may be unable to maintain a commercially viable cost structure.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe processes involved in manufacturing our product\ncandidates are complex, expensive, highly regulated and subject to multiple risks. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes\ncould result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. Further, as product candidates are developed\nthrough preclinical studies to potential future clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects\nof the development program, such as manufacturing methods, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such\nchanges carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our product candidates\nto perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials. We expect to rely on third-party\nmanufacturers for the manufacturing of our products.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn order to conduct planned or future clinical\ntrials of our product candidates, or supply commercial products, if approved, we will need to have them manufactured in small and large\nquantities. Our manufacturing partners may be unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any of our product candidates\nin a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. In addition, quality issues may arise during scale-up activities. If our manufacturing\npartners are unable to successfully scale up the manufacture of our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity, the development,\ntesting and potential clinical trials of that product candidate may be delayed or become infeasible, and regulatory approval or commercial\nlaunch of any resulting product may be delayed or not obtained, which could significantly harm our business. The same risks would apply\nto our internal manufacturing facilities, should we in the future decide to build internal manufacturing capacity. In addition, building\ninternal manufacturing capacity would carry significant risks in terms of being able to plan, design and execute on a complex project\nto build manufacturing facilities in a timely and cost-efficient manner.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, the manufacturing process for any\nproducts that we may develop is subject to FDA, EMA and foreign regulatory authority approval processes and continuous oversight, and\nwe will need to contract with manufacturers who can meet all applicable FDA, EMA and foreign regulatory authority requirements, including\ncomplying with current good manufacturing processes, or on an ongoing basis. If we or our third-party manufacturers are unable to reliably\nproduce products to specifications acceptable to the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities, we may not obtain or maintain the approvals\nwe need to commercialize such products. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, there is no assurance\nthat either we or our third-party manufacturers will be able to manufacture the approved product to specifications acceptable to the FDA,\nEMA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product,\nor to meet potential future demand. Any of these challenges could delay initiation and completion of clinical trials, require bridging\nclinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidate,\nimpair commercialization efforts, increase our cost of goods, and have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition,\nresults of operations and growth prospects.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n54\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights\nthroughout the world.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents or establishing\nother intellectual property rights to our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and\nour intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States or\nnon-existent. For example, the Melligen cells are protected by patents only in the U.S. and Europe and we are only pursuing patent protection\nfor our pancreatic cancer product candidate in the U.S., Australia and Canada.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMany companies have encountered significant problems\nin protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries do not favor the\nenforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our\npatents or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent and other intellectual property\nrights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business,\ncould put our patents or intellectual property rights at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications\nat risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate,\nand the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMany countries, including European Union countries,\nIndia, Japan and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under specified circumstances to grant\nlicenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a\nlicense to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our ability to pursue strategic\nalternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with potential third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing\napproval for and/or commercialize our product candidates, and consequently our potential revenue opportunities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur intellectual property and data and market\nexclusivity may not be sufficient to block others from commercializing identical or competing products. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability\nto obtain and maintain both intellectual property rights and data and market exclusivity for our product candidates in order to block\nothers from commercializing identical or competing products. Establishing intellectual property rights includes filing, prosecuting, maintaining\nand enforcing patents that cover our product candidates and variations of our product candidates and protecting our trade secrets and\nother proprietary information related to our product candidates from unauthorized use.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe foundational patents relating to the Cell-in-the-Box\u00ae\ntechnology that were formerly licensed from Bavarian Nordic/GSF covering capsules encapsulating cells expressing cytochrome P450 and treatment\nmethods using the same expired on March 27, 2017. Currently, we do not have any issued patents in any countries covering our product candidate\nfor the treatment of pancreatic cancer. We exclusively license from UTS patented Melligen cells, which cover our product candidate for\nthe treatment of diabetes, which are issued in the U.S. and Europe and expire in August 2028. Currently, we do not have any issued patents\nor pending applications covering our product candidate for the treatment of cancer using cannabinoids or our product candidate for the\ntreatment of malignant ascites fluid therapy. We may not be able to obtain protection for our product candidates or variations of our\nproduct candidates. Even if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide\nus with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage or\nour patents may expire before or shortly after our product candidate is approved. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned\nor licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n55\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConfidential know-how and trade secrets are only\nprotectable to the extent a third party utilizes the confidential know-how or trade secret in an unauthorized manner; however, if a third\nparty is able to independently duplicate the technology, such as through reverse engineering, without access to or use of our confidential\nknow-how or trade secret, we would have no recourse.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, data exclusivity that is provided\nthrough the BPCIA in the U.S. and equivalents in foreign countries is limited in both time and scope. The BPCIA bars the FDA from approving\nbiosimilar applications for 12 years after an innovator biological product receives initial marketing approval, however it does not bar\nthe FDA from approving an identical or similar product that is the subject of its own BLA. Finally, upon the approval of the first BLA\nfor a biologic designated as an Orphan Drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of that BLA is entitled to 7 years of exclusive marketing\nrights in the U.S. for biologic for the particular indication unless the sponsor cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities\nto meet the needs of persons with the disease. In Europe, this exclusivity is 10 years. However, Orphan Drug status for an approved indication\ndoes not prevent another company from seeking approval of a biologic that has other labeled indications that are not under orphan or other\nexclusivities. In addition, in the U.S., the FDA is not prevented from approving another biologic for the same labeled Orphan indication\nif the company can demonstrate that the other biologic is clinically superior to first approved product.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven if we are able to obtain patents, maintain\nconfidential information, trade secrets, obtain data, and market exclusivity for our product candidates, our competitors may be able to\ndevelop and obtain approval of identical or competing products.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain\nintellectual property protection for our technology and product candidates, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection obtained\nis not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our\nability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability\nto obtain and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We seek\nto protect our proprietary position by filing patents in the U.S. and abroad related to our product candidates. Our patent portfolio relating\nto the Cell-in-the-Box\n\u00ae\n technology was formerly licensed from Bavarian Nordic/GSF. The Bavarian Nordic/GSF patents covered\ncapsules encapsulating cells expressing cytochrome P450 and treatment methods using the same. These patents expired on March 27, 2017.\nWe exclusively license, from UTS, patented Melligen cells, which cover our product candidate for the treatment of diabetes. The patents\nare issued in the U.S. and Europe and expire in August 2028. Currently, we do not have any issued patents in any countries covering our\nproduct candidate for the treatment of cancer; we have pending applications in the U.S., Australia and Canada and relating to our product\ncandidate for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. If issued, such patents would expire in March 2038.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe cannot estimate the financial or other impact\nof the expiration of the Bavarian Nordic/GSF patents or the failure of the USPTO or similar regulatory authorities in other countries\ndenying the claims we pursue in the U.S. and other countries.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe patent prosecution and/or patent maintenance\nprocess is expensive and time-consuming. We may not be able to file and prosecute or maintain all necessary or desirable patent applications\nor maintain the existing patents at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations\nand may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions. Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, patents or other intellectual\nproperty rights may be unavailable or limited in scope. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our discovery\nand preclinical development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMoreover, in some circumstances, we do not have\nthe right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that\nwe license from third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with\nthe best interests of our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n56\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical\ncompanies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much\nlitigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. For example,\nIndia does not allow patents for methods of treating the human body. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag\nthe actual discoveries, and patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 or more months\nafter filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed\nin our licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Consequently,\nthe issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Any future patent applications\nmay not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others\nfrom commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in\nthe U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties\nand costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned or licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our owned or licensed\npatents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (\u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d) was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith\nAct includes several significant changes to patent law in the U.S. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are\nprosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration\nof the Leahy-Smith Act. Many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, such as the first to file provisions,\nonly became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation\nof our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution\nof our owned or licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our owned or licensed patents, all of which could have\na material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance\nsubmission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter-party review, post-grant review\nor interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission,\nproceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology\nor products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without\ninfringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications\nis threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current our future product\ncandidates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications\nissue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing\nwith us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents\nby developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as\nto its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices\nin the U.S. and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated\nor held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical\ntechnology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required\nfor the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or\nshortly after such candidates are commercialized. Thus, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights\nto exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n57\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe risks described elsewhere pertaining to our\npatents and other intellectual property rights also apply to the intellectual property rights that we license, and any failure to obtain,\nmaintain and enforce these rights could have a material adverse effect on our business. In some cases, we may not have control over the\nprosecution, maintenance or enforcement of the patents that we license. Moreover, our licensors may fail to take the steps that we believe\nare necessary or desirable to obtain, maintain and enforce the licensed patents. Any inability on our part to protect adequately our intellectual\nproperty may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we do not obtain patent and/or data exclusivity for our product\ncandidates, our business may be materially harmed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur commercial success will largely depend on\nour ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection and/or data exclusivity under the BPCIA in the U.S.\nand other countries with respect to our proprietary technology, product candidates and our target indications.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are unable to obtain patents covering our\nproduct candidates or obtain data and/or marketing exclusivity for our product candidates, our competitors may be able to take advantage\nof our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data to obtain approval of competing\nproducts, such as a biosimilar, earlier than might otherwise be the case.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection\ndepends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent\nagencies. Our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity\nfees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent\nagencies outside of the U.S. in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental\npatent agencies require compliance with numerous procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application\nprocess. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured\nby payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance\ncan result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the\nrelevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material\nadverse effect on our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect\nor enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause competition in our industry is intense,\ncompetitors may infringe or otherwise violate our issued patents, patents of our licensors or other intellectual property. To counter\ninfringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims\nwe assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their\npatents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole\nor in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue because our\npatents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of the patents associated\nwith our business at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. We may also elect to enter license agreements to settle patent\ninfringement claims or to resolve disputes prior to litigation, and any such license agreements may require us to pay royalties and other\nfees that could be significant. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in intellectual property litigation,\nthere is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n58\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we breach any of our license or collaboration\nagreements, it could compromise our development and commercialization efforts for our product candidates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have licensed rights to intellectual property\nfrom third parties to commercialize our product candidates, including our Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae\n Technology for LAPC and diabetes.\nIf we materially breach or fail to perform any provision under these license and collaboration agreements, including failure to make payments\nto a licensor or collaborator when due for royalties and failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize our\nproduct candidates, such licensors and collaborators have the right to terminate our agreements, and upon the effective date of such termination,\nour right to practice the licensed intellectual property would end. Any uncured, material breach under the agreements could result in\nour loss of rights to practice the patent rights and other intellectual property licensed to us under the agreements and could result\nin the loss of our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may need to license certain intellectual\nproperty from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA third party may hold intellectual property,\nincluding patent rights, which are important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented\nor proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from\nthese third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. Although we believe that licenses\nto these patents may be available from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, if we were not able to obtain a license,\nor are not able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings\nalleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material\nadverse effect on the success of our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability,\nand the ability of our collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies\nwithout infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology\nand pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual\nproperty rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO and various\ngovernmental patent agencies outside of the U.S. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or\npatents that may be granted in the future.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s\nintellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our\nproduct candidates and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nEven if we could obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed\nto us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could\nbe found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a\npatent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business\noperations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets\nof third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or\nmaintaining necessary rights for its development pipeline through acquisitions and licenses from third parties.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause our programs may involve additional product\ncandidates that may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business may depend in part on our\nability to acquire, in-license or use these proprietary rights. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of\nuse or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify. The licensing and acquisition of third-party\nintellectual property rights is a competitive area, and numerous established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire\nthird-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage\nover us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n59\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, companies that perceive us to be\na competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual\nproperty rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment. If we are unable to successfully obtain\nrights to required third-party intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality\nof our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our\ntechnology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information,\nto maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering non-disclosure and confidentiality\nagreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract\nmanufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We seek to protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by\nentering confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants; however, we cannot be certain that such agreements have been entered\nwith all relevant parties.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMoreover, to the extent we enter such agreements,\nany of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets to unaffiliated third\nparties. We may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated\na trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside\nthe U.S. are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently\ndeveloped by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate them, from using that technology\nor information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our\ncompetitive position would be harmed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe majority of the technology that we license\nand use for our product candidates is not protected by patents, but rather is based upon confidential know-how and trade secrets. Confidential\nknow-how and trade secrets are only protectable to the extent a third party utilizes the confidential know-how or trade secret in an unauthorized\nmanner; however, if a third party is able to independently duplicate the technology, such as through reverse engineering, without access\nto or use of our confidential know-how or trade secret, we would have no recourse.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees,\nconsultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of their former employers or other third\nparties.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe employ individuals and use consultants and\nindependent contractors who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. Although we seek to ensure that\nour employees and our consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work\nfor us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used\nor disclosed trade secrets, or other confidential information of our employees\u2019, consultants\u2019 or independent contractors\u2019\nformer employers, clients or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an\nownership interest in our patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending\nthese claims, and if we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property\nrights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Even if we are successful, litigation could result\nin substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and others working for us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require\nour employees, consultants and independent contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements\nassigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops\nintellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and\nwe may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what\nwe regard as our intellectual property. If we or our licensors fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying\nmonetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we and our licensors are successful in prosecuting\nor defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n60\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny trademarks we have obtained or may obtain\nmay be infringed or successfully challenged, resulting in harm to our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe expect to rely on trademarks as one means to\ndistinguish any of our drug candidates that are approved for marketing from the products of our competitors. Once we select new trademarks\nand apply to register them, our trademark applications may not be approved. Third parties may oppose or attempt to cancel our trademark\napplications or trademarks, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. If our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could\nbe forced to rebrand our drugs, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising\nand marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily\naddress all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our\nintellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business,\nor permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nothers may be able to make compositions that are the same as or like our product candidates, but that are not covered by the claims of any patents that we may own or exclusively license;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nothers may be able to make product that is like the product candidates we intend to commercialize that is not covered by any patents that we might own or exclusively license and have the right to enforce;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nwe, our licensors or any collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by issued patents or pending patent applications that we may own;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nwe, our licensors or any collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nissued patents that we may own may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable because of legal challenges;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in the U.S. and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Business Model and Operations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDevelopment of brand awareness is critical\nto our success.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor certain market segments that we plan to pursue,\nthe development of our brand awareness is essential for us to reduce our marketing expenditures over time and realize greater benefits\nfrom marketing expenditures. If our brand-marketing efforts are unsuccessful, growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations\nwould be adversely affected. Our brand awareness efforts have required, and will most likely continue to require, additional expenses\nand time of the current senior management team.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n61\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny weakness in our internal controls could\nhave a material adverse effect on us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs discussed in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d\nthe senior management has identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and cannot assure you that\nadditional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. We cannot assure you that these steps will be successful in preventing\nmaterial weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting in the future. In addition, any such\nfailure could adversely affect our ability to report financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could have other material\neffects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Material weaknesses in internal controls\nover financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial\ninformation which could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe insurance coverage and reimbursement\nstatus of newly approved products are uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current\nproducts could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe availability and extent of reimbursement by\ngovernmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments. Sales of our products, if approved\nwill depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products, if approved, will be paid by\nhealth maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health\nadministration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available\nonly to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved\nreimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on\nour investment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the\ninsurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the U.S., the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines\nare typically made by the CMS, an agency within the HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed\nunder Medicare. Private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect\nto reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as ours, as there is no body of established practices and precedents for these\nnew products. Reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more conservative than CMS. For example, several cancer drugs have been approved\nfor reimbursement in the U.S. and have not been approved for reimbursement in certain European countries. Outside the U.S., international\noperations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing\nemphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and\nusage of our product candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as\npart of national health systems. In general, the prices of medicines under such systems are substantially lower than in the U.S. Other\ncountries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls\nor other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we can charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets\noutside the U.S., the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the U.S. and may be insufficient to generate commercially\nreasonable revenues and profits.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n62\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and\nthird-party payors, in the U.S. and abroad, to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and\nlevel of reimbursement for new products approved and, thus, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates.\nWe expect to experience pricing pressures with the sale of any of our products, if approved, due to the trend toward managed healthcare,\nthe increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs\nin general, particularly prescription drugs and biologics and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Because\nof this, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products into the healthcare market.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to CMS and private payors, professional\norganizations such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Society of Clinical Oncology can influence decisions\nabout reimbursement for new medicines by determining standards for care. Many private payors may also contract with commercial vendors\nwho sell software that provide guidelines that attempt to limit utilization of, and therefore reimbursement for, certain products deemed\nto provide limited benefit to existing alternatives. Such organizations may set guidelines that limit reimbursement or utilization of\nour products.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur employees, consultants and independent\ncontractors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements,\nwhich could subject us to significant liability and harm our reputation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud and other\nmisconduct by those who work for us. Misconduct by employees, consultants or independent contractors could include failures to comply\nwith the FCPA or with the DEA, the FDA or the EMA regulations or similar regulations of other foreign regulatory authorities or to provide\naccurate information to the DEA, the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, misconduct could include failures\nto comply with certain manufacturing standards, to comply with U.S. federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations\nand similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to report financial information\nor data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. Misconduct by those who work for us could also involve the improper use\nof information obtained during our clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We\nhave implemented and will enforce a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct\nby those who work for us. The precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged\nrisks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with\nsuch laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting\nour rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant\nfines or other sanctions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur transactions and relationships outside\nthe U.S. will be subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs we pursue international clinical trials, licensing\nand, in the future, sales arrangements outside the U.S., we will be heavily regulated and expect to have significant interaction with\nforeign officials. Additionally, in many countries outside the U.S., the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed\nby the government and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our interactions with these prescribers and\npurchasers would be subject to regulation under the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other\ncountries in which we operate. The FCPA generally prohibits paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value,\ndirectly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain\nbusiness. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nof the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations may\nbe costly and may limit our ability to expand into certain markets. There is no certainty that all our employees, agents, contractors,\nor collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level\nof complexity of these laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against\nus, our officers, or our employees, the closing down of our facilities, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business\nactivities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations\ncould include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation,\nour brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees and our business, prospects, operating results\nand financial condition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n63\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could\ncause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability\nexposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially\nsell any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products\ncaused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nDecreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nInjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nWithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nSignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nSubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nLoss of revenue;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nReduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe currently do not have product liability insurance\nbecause we do not have any products to market. We will need such insurance for clinical trials, if allowed to proceed, and for commercialization\nof our products, if approved. Product liability insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance\ncoverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe incur increased costs because of operating\nas a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs a public company, we have incurred and are\ncontinuing to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. These expenses may increase. We are subject to, among others, the\nreporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Protection Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the Commission. Our management and other personnel devote\na substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMoreover, these rules and regulations have substantially\nincreased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costlier. The increased costs have\nincreased our net loss. These rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain sufficient director\nand officer liability insurance coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may continue to incur\nto respond to these requirements. The ongoing impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain\nqualified persons to serve on our Board, our Board committees or as executive officers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisk Factors Related to Our Stock and Financial\nCondition\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq.\nMarket prices for our shares of common stock will be influenced by several factors, including, but not limited to:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe issuance of new shares pursuant to future offering;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nChanges in interest rates;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nNew services or significant contracts and acquisitions;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nVariations in quarterly operating results;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nChange in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nThe depth and liquidity of the market for the shares;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nInvestor perceptions of us and of investments based in the countries where we do business or conduct research; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nGeneral economic and other national and international conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n64\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity\nofferings.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may in\nthe future offer additional common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices lower than\nthat paid by existing investors.

To\nthe extent that holders of existing options or warrants sell the shares of common stock issued upon the exercise of warrants, the market\nprice of our common stock may decrease due to the additional selling pressure in the market.

Over the past twelve months, shares of our common stock were quoted and traded at a high of $3.10\nper share and a low of $1.95 per share. The inability to sell securities in a rapidly declining market may substantially increase the\nrisk of loss because the price of our common stock may suffer greater declines due to the historical price volatility of our shares. Certain\nfactors, some of which are beyond our control, which may cause our share price to fluctuate significantly include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nVariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nLoss of a key relationship or failure to complete significant product candidate milestones timely or at all;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nAdditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nFluctuations in the stock market price and volume.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market\nin general, and the over-the-counter markets in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In some cases, these\nfluctuations are unrelated or disproportionate to the performance of the underlying company. These market and industry factors may materially\nand adversely affect our share price, regardless of our performance or whether we meet our business objectives. In the past, class action\nlitigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of those companies\u2019 common\nstock. If we become involved in this type of litigation in the future, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\nattention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on us and the trading price of our common stock.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n67\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have no plans to pay dividends in the\nforeseeable future, and investors may not expect a dividend as a return of or on any investment in us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have not paid dividends on our shares of common\nstock and do not anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of the certificate of designations\ngoverning our Series B convertible preferred stock presently restricts our ability to pay dividends.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under the SEC\u2019s\ndisclosure rules and have elected to comply with the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under the SEC\u2019s\ndisclosure rules, meaning that we have either:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\na public float of less than $250 million; or\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nannual revenues of less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nno public float; or\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\na public float of less than $700 million.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are permitted\nto comply with scaled-back disclosure obligations in our SEC filings compared to other issuers, including with respect to disclosure obligations\nregarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We have elected to adopt the accommodations available to\nsmaller reporting companies. Until we cease to be a smaller reporting company, the scaled-back disclosure in our SEC filings will result\nin less information about our company being available than for other public companies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf investors consider our common stock less attractive\nas a result of our election to use the scaled-back disclosure permitted for smaller reporting companies, there may be a less active trading\nmarket for our common stock and our share price may be more volatile.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs a non-accelerated filer, we are not required to comply with\nthe auditor attestation requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a non-accelerated filer under the Exchange\nAct, and we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nTherefore, our internal controls over financial reporting will not receive the level of review provided by the process relating to the\nauditor attestation included in annual reports of issuers that are subject to the auditor attestation requirements. In addition, we cannot\npredict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements.\nIf some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and\ntrading price for our common stock may be negatively affected.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n68\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Employee and Tax Matters,\nManaging Growth and Macroeconomic Conditions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have experienced\nsignificant management changes which could increase our control risks and have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business\nand our results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have recently experienced\na number of changes in our management, including changes in our Chief Executive Officer and Board. The magnitude of these changes and\nthe short time interval in which they have occurred add to the risks of control failures, including a failure in the effective operation\nof our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures. Control failures could result in material\nadverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. It may take time for the new management team to become sufficiently\nfamiliar with our business and each other to effectively develop and implement our business strategies. The turnover of key management\npositions could further harm our financial performance and results of operations. Management attention may be diverted from regular business\nconcerns by reorganizations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have a limited number of employees and\nare highly dependent on our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Our future success depends on our ability to retain these\nofficers and other key personnel and to attract, retain and motivate other needed qualified personnel.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are an early-stage biotechnology company with\na limited operating history. As of April 30, 2023, we had 2 full-time employees and numerous consultants. We are highly dependent on the\nR&D, clinical and business development expertise of the principal members of our management, scientific and clinical teams, specifically,\non our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing\nand sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our Interim Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer or other key employees or consultants could severely impede the achievement of our R&D and commercialization\nof our product candidates and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, replacing executive officers and\nkey employees and consultants may be difficult and may take an extended period because of the limited number of individuals in our industry\nwith the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize our product\ncandidates. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel\non acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe also experience competition for the hiring\nof scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on other consultants and advisors,\nincluding scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our discovery, preclinical and clinical development and commercialization\nstrategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory\ncontracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality\npersonnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n69\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur ability to use our net operating loss\ncarryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of April 30, 2023, we had federal net operating\nloss carryforwards of approximately $56 million, and approximately $47 million for state net operating losses, which will begin to expire\nin varying amounts beginning in 2023. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the\nCode, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d (generally defined as a\ngreater than 50-percentage-point cumulative change (by value) in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year\nperiod), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to\noffset its post-change taxable income or taxes will be limited to approximately $19 million and $6 million for federal and state, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe experienced ownership changes in the past and\ncould experience one or more ownership changes in the future, some of which are outside our control. Our net operating loss carryforwards\nare subject to limitation under state laws. Further, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards of companies that we may\nacquire in the future may also be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to tax law changes, such as suspensions on the\nuse of net operating loss carryforwards, or other unforeseen reasons, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards\nand other pre-change tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitation or expire.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe expect to expand our development and\nregulatory capabilities and potentially implement sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. Thus, we may encounter difficulties\nin managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe expect to experience significant growth in\nthe number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs and, if\nany of our product candidates receive marketing approval, sales, marketing and distribution. To manage our anticipated future growth,\nwe must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit\nand train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in\nmanaging a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and\ntrain additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and\nbusiness development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected\nby general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. The recent global financial crisis related to COVID-19\ncaused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Also, geopolitical tensions and the conflict between Russia\nand Ukraine continue to escalate, and numerous jurisdictions have imposed harsh sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia,\nas well as enhanced export controls on certain products and industries. These and any additional sanctions and export controls, as well\nas any counter responses by the governments of Russia or other jurisdictions, could adversely affect, directly or indirectly, the global\nsupply chain, with negative implications on the availability and prices of raw materials, energy prices, and our customers, as well as\nthe global financial markets and financial services industry.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA severe or prolonged economic downturn, such\nas the recent global financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including our ability to raise additional capital\nwhen needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply\ndisruption. Any of the foregoing could adversely impact our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business and operations would suffer\nin the event of system failures.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDespite the implementation of security measures,\nour internal computer systems and those of our third-party service providers on whom we rely on are vulnerable to damage from computer\nviruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Furthermore, we have little\nor no control over the security measures and computer systems of our third-party service providers. While we and, to our knowledge, our\nthird-party service providers have not experienced any such system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were\nto occur and cause interruptions in our operations or the operations of our third-party service providers, it could result in a material\ndisruption of our drug development programs. If any disruptions occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n70\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWe are subject to legal, regulatory, financial\nand other risks with our operations outside the U.S.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe operate globally and are attempting to develop\nproducts in multiple countries. Consequently, we face complex legal and regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions, which may expose\nus to certain financial and other risks. International operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\ngreater difficulty in overseeing foreign operations;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nlogistical and communications challenges;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\npotential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices, including export license requirements, trade barriers, tariffs and tax laws;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nburdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\npolitical and economic instability;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nincreases in duties and taxation;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nforeign tax laws and potential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\ngreater difficulty in protecting intellectual property;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nthe risk of third-party disputes over ownership of intellectual property and infringement of third-party intellectual property by our products; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\ngeneral social, economic and political conditions in these foreign markets.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n",
    "item7": ">ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following discussion may contain forward-looking\nstatements that involve risks and uncertainties. As described under the caption \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d\nour actual results could differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include,\nbut are not limited to, any factors discussed in this section as well as factors described in Part II, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nand under the caption \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a biotechnology company focused on developing\nand preparing to commercialize cellular therapies for cancer, diabetes and malignant ascites based upon our proprietary cellulose-based\nlive cell encapsulation technology we refer to as Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae\n. We are working to advance clinical research and development\nof new cellular-based therapies in oncology and diabetes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are actively engaged preparing for a clinical\ntrial in LAPC using encapsulated live cells like those used in the previous Phase 1/2 and Phase 2 clinical trials discussed above.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn September 1, 2020, we submitted an IND to the\nFDA for our planned clinical trial in LAPC. On October 1, 2020, we received notice from the FDA that it had placed our IND on clinical\nhold. On October 30, 2020, the FDA sent a letter to us setting forth the reasons for the clinical hold and specific guidance on what we\nmust do to have the clinical hold lifted.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo address our clinical hold, we assembled a team\nof regulatory and scientific experts to respond to the items requested by the FDA. That team has been working to complete the list of\nitems requested by the FDA. For a complete discussion of what the FDA requires of us and the efforts we have undertaken to lift the clinical\nhold, see Item 1. Business under the Section entitled, \u201cClinical Hold\u201d of this Report.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are also developing a way to delay the production\nand accumulation of malignant ascites that results from many types of abdominal cancerous tumors. Our therapy for malignant ascites involves\nusing the same encapsulated cells we employ for pancreatic cancer but placing the encapsulated cells in the peritoneal cavity of a patient\nand administering ifosfamide intravenously.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to these cancer programs, we have\nalso been considering ways to exploit the benefits of the Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae\n technology to develop therapies for cancer that\ninvolve prodrugs based upon certain constituents of the \nCannabis\n plant. However, until the FDA allows us to commence our clinical\ntrial in LAPC and we are able to validate our Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae\n encapsulation technology in a clinical trial, we are not spending\nany further resources developing our Cannabis Program.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, we have been developing a potential therapy\nfor Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes Our product candidate for the treatment of diabetes consists of encapsulated\ngenetically modified insulin-producing cells. The encapsulation will be done using the Cell-in-a-Box\n\u00ae\n technology. Implanting\nthese encapsulated cells in the body is designed to function as a bio-artificial pancreas for purposes of insulin production.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n74\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nReverse Stock Split\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEffective July 12, 2021, we filed a Certificate\nof Change to our Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the \u201cArticles of Incorporation\u201d) with the Nevada Secretary of State\nthat authorized a 1:1500 reverse stock split of our common stock. The reverse stock split resulted in reducing the authorized number of\nshares of our common stock from 50 billion to thirty-three million three hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-four with\na par value of $0.0001 per share. Any fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split were rounded up to the next whole share.\nAll warrants, option, share and per share information in this Report gives retroactive effect to such 1:1500 reverse stock split.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIncrease in Authorized Shares \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn March 14, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Change\nwith the State of Nevada, Secretary of State, to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock to 133,333,334 shares effective\nimmediately. The par value remained $0.0001 per share.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCOVID-19 Impact on Our Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe face the ongoing risk that the coronavirus\npandemic may slow our operations, our preclinical studies or the eventual enrollment of our planned clinical trial. In order to prioritize\npatient health and that of the investigators at clinical trial sites, we may need monitor enrollment of patients in our clinical study.\nIn addition, some patients may be unwilling to enroll in our trials or be unable to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines\nor travel restrictions impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. These and other factors outside of our control could\ndelay our ability to conduct clinical trials or release clinical trial results. In addition, the effects of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic\nmay also increase non-trial costs such as insurance premiums, increase the demand for and cost of capital, increase loss of work time\nfrom key personnel, and negatively impact our key clinical trial vendors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPerformance Indicators\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNon-financial performance indicators used by management\nto manage and assess how the business is progressing will include, but are not limited to, the ability to: (i) acquire appropriate funding\nfor all aspects of our operations; (ii) acquire and complete necessary contracts; (iii) complete activities for producing genetically\nmodified human cells and having them encapsulated for our preclinical studies and the planned clinical trial in LAPC; (iv) have regulatory\nwork completed to enable studies and trials to be submitted to regulatory agencies; (v) complete all required tests and studies on the\ncells and capsules we plan to use in our clinical trial in patients with LAPC; (vi) ensure completion of the production of encapsulated\ncells according to cGMP regulations to use in our planned clinical trial; (vii) complete all of the tasked the FDA requires of us in order\nto have the clinical hold lifted; and (viii) obtain approval from the FDA to lift the clinical hold on our IND that we may commence our\nplanned clinical trial in LAPC.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere are numerous items required to be completed\nsuccessfully to ensure our final product candidate is ready for use in our planned clinical trial in LAPC. The effects of material transactions\nwith related parties, and certain other parties to the extent necessary for such an undertaking, may have substantial effects on both\nthe timeliness and success of our current and prospective financial position and operating results. Nonetheless, we are actively working\nto ensure strong ties and interactions to minimize the inherent risks regarding success. We do not believe there are factors which will\ncause materially different amounts to be reported than those presented in this Report. We aim to assess this regularly to provide accurate\ninformation to our shareholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n75\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of April 30, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents\ntotaled approximately $68 million, compared to approximately $85.4 million as of April 30, 2022. Working capital was approximately $67.6\nmillion as of April 30, 2023, and approximately $84.8 million as of April 30, 2022. The decrease in cash is attributable to the repurchase\nof our common stock pursuant to the Repurchase Programs, recorded as treasury stock and an increase in our operating expenses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021 Underwritten Offering\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn August 9, 2021, we entered into an underwriting\nagreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co. (\u201cWainwright\u201d), pursuant to which we offered and sold an aggregate of 2,630,385 shares\nof common stock, and 899,027 pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock, and common warrants to purchase 4,028,528 shares of common\nstock (the \u201cFirst 2021 Offering\u201d). The common warrants sold in the First 2021 Offering have an exercise price of $4.25 per\nshare, were exercisable immediately upon issuance, and expire five years following the date of issuance. The pre-funded warrants sold\nin the First 2021 Offering have an exercise price of $0.001 per share, were exercisable immediately upon issuance, and do not have an\nexpiration date. The gross proceeds of the First 2021 Offering were $15 million, before deduction of underwriting discounts, commissions,\nand estimated offering expenses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWainwright acted as the exclusive placement agent\nfor the Second 2021 Offering pursuant to an engagement letter with the Company dated April 26, 2021 (the \u201cWainwright Engagement\nLetter\u201d). Pursuant to the Wainwright Engagement Letter and in connection with the First 2021 Offering, we paid Wainwright a placement\nagent fee equal to 7.5% of the aggregate gross proceeds and a management fee equal to 1.0% of the gross proceeds, and we issued Wainwright\nwarrants to purchase up to [ ] shares of common stock (the \u201cPlacement Agent Warrants\u201d). The Placement Agent Warrants have\nan exercise price of $6.25 per share, were exercisable immediately upon issuance, and expire five years following the date of issuance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn August 2021, we received twenty-seven (27)\nexercise notices from holders of the common warrants issued in the First 2021 Offering, pursuant to which we received approximately $10,720,000\nand issued 2,522,387 shares of common stock (the \u201c2021 Warrant Exercises\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021 Registered Direct Offering and Concurrent\nPrivate Placement\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn August 19, 2021, we entered into a securities\npurchase agreement with certain institutional investors, pursuant to which we sold (i) 8,430,000 shares of common stock and pre-funded\nwarrants to purchase up to 5,570,000 shares of common stock in a registered direct offering and (ii) unregistered warrants to purchase\nup to 7,000,000 shares of common stock (the \u201cSeries A Warrants\u201d) in a concurrent private placement (collectively, the \u201cSecond\n2021 Offering\u201d). The pre-funded warrants sold in the Second 2021 Offering have an exercise price of $0.001 per share, were exercisable\nimmediately upon issuance, and do not have an expiration date. The Series A Warrants have an exercise price of $5.00 per share, were exercisable\nimmediately upon issuance, and expire five years following the date of issuance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWainwright acted as the exclusive placement agent\nfor the Second 2021 Offering pursuant to the Wainwright Engagement Letter. Pursuant to such engagement letter and in connection with the\nSecond 2021 Offering, we paid Wainwright a placement agent fee equal to 7.5% of the aggregate gross proceeds and a management fee equal\nto 1.0% of the gross proceeds, and we issued Wainwright an additional 1,050,000 Placement Agent Warrants. We received gross proceeds from\nthe Second 2021 Offering, before deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, of approximately\n$70 million. On November 17, 2021, our Registration Statement on Form S-3 registering the resale of the shares of common stock underlying\nthe Series A Warrants and the Placement Agent Warrants was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDuring the year ended April 30, 2022, we received\napproximately $87.4 million from the First 2021 Offering, the Second 2021 Offering and the 2021 Warrant Exercises. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n76\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRepurchase Programs\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPursuant to the First Repurchase Program, we may\nacquire up to $10 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, as determined by a formula based on the market price of the common\nstock and average daily volumes. Pursuant to the Second Repurchase Program, we may acquire up to $10 million of our outstanding shares\nof common stock from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated block transactions or other means in accordance with\napplicable securities laws. For more information on the Repurchase Programs, see \u201cNote 12 \u2013 Treasury Stock.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOther Liquidity Matters\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have no other off-balance sheet arrangements\nthat could have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,\nchanges in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo meet our short and long-term liquidity needs,\nwe expect to use existing cash balances and a variety of other means. Other sources of liquidity could include additional potential issuances\nof debt or equity securities in public or private financings, partnerships, collaborations and sale of assets. Our history of operating\nlosses and liquidity challenges may make it difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms or at all. The demand for the equity\nand debt of pharmaceutical companies like ours is dependent upon many factors, including the general state of the financial markets. During\ntimes of extreme market volatility, capital may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain such additional\ncapital could materially and adversely affect our business operations. Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will\ndepend on many factors, but we believe that our cash on hand will enable us to fund operating expenses for at least the next 12 months\nfollowing the issuance of our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYear ended April 30, 2023, compared to year\nended April 30, 2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe had no revenues in the fiscal years ended April\n30, 2023, and 2022.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOperating Expenses\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur total operating expenses during the year ended\nApril 30, 2023 were $6,455,494, representing an increase of $2,063,480 compared to the year ended April 30, 2022.

We are required to make assumptions and estimates\nabout future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related\ndisclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management\nbelieves to be relevant at the time our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting\npolicies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our Consolidated Financial Statements are presented fairly and in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from\nour assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed\nin Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d\nof this Report. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating\nour reported financial results and require management\u2019s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need\nto make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates\nand related disclosures with our Board.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nR&D expenses consist of costs incurred for\ndirect and overhead-related research expenses and are expensed as incurred. Costs to acquire technologies, including licenses, which are\nutilized in R&D and that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred. Technology developed for use in our product candidates\nis expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur stock-based compensation plans are described\nin Note 4 and 5 of the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements to this Report. We follow the provisions of ASC 718, \nCompensation\n- Stock Compensation \n(\u201cASC 718\u201d), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based\nawards made to employees.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBasic net income (loss) per share of common stock\nis computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock\nis computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and shares of common stock equivalents outstanding. Potentially\ndilutive stock options and warrants to purchase 10,172,116 and 10,813,635 post reverse stock split shares of common stock at April 30,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share because the effect would be anti-dilutive.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDuring the current and prior year, there were\nno new accounting pronouncements that need to be disclosed in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n",
