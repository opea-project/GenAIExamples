While we believe our intellectual property is valuable and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success, we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.\nFor more information on the risks related to our intellectual property rights, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLooking Towards the Future \nIn Fiscal 2024 we intend to continue to implement strategies that are designed to: \nInvest in Innovation. \nWe believe we are well-positioned to develop additional innovative solutions to address the evolving market. We plan to continue investing in technology innovation by funding internal development, acquiring complementary technologies and collaborating with third parties.\nInvest in the Cloud.\n Today, the destination for innovation is the cloud. Businesses of all sizes rely on a combination of APIs, public and private clouds, managed services and off-cloud solutions. As a result, we are committed to continue to modernize our technology infrastructure and leverage existing investments in the OpenText Cloud. The combination of \n15\nTable of Contents\nOpenText cloud-native applications and managed services, together with the scalability and performance of our partner public cloud providers, offer more secure, reliable and compliant solutions to customers wanting to deploy cloud-based Information Management applications. OpenText Cloud Editions is designed to build additional flexibility and scalability for our customers: becoming cloud-native, connecting anything and extending capabilities quickly with multi-tenant SaaS applications and services.\nInvest in AI. \nWe believe that customers are seeking practical AI and OpenText is in a strong position to help customers discover the most prevailing use cases that leverage an interconnected source of all data types (content, business network, customer experience, IT service management, application development, asset management, IoT, etc.). We believe one of the greatest opportunities is to help customers leverage their operational and experience data with generative AI to discover new insights for efficiency and competitive advantages. We strive to co-innovate with customers by taking the proven concept of machine learning and applying it to their organizational needs.\nBroaden Global Presence\n. As customers become increasingly multi-national and as international markets continue to adopt Information Management solutions, we plan to further grow our brand, presence and partner networks in these new markets. We are focused on using our direct sales for targeting existing G10K customers and plan to address new geographies and SMB customers, jointly with our partners.\nBroaden Our Information Management Reach into the G10K. \nAs technologies and customers become more sophisticated, we intend to be a leader in expanding the definition of traditional market sectors. We continue to expand our direct sales coverage of the G10K as we focus on connecting this marquee customer base to our information platform.\nDeepen Existing Customer Footprint\n. We believe one of our greatest opportunities is to sell newly developed or acquired technologies to our existing customer base, and cross-sell historical OpenText products to newly acquired customers. We have significant expertise in a number of industry sectors and aim to increase our customer penetration based on our strong credentials. We are particularly focused on circumstances where the customer is looking to consolidate multiple vendors with solutions from a single source while addressing a broader spectrum of business problems or equally new or existing customers looking to take a more holistic approach to digital transformation.\nInvest in Technology Leadership.\n We believe we are well-positioned to develop additional innovative solutions to address the evolving market. We plan to continue investing in technology innovation by funding internal development, acquiring complementary technologies and collaborating with third-parties.\nDeepen Strategic Partnerships.\n OpenText is committed culturally, programmatically and strategically to be a partner-embracing company. Our partnerships with companies such as SAP SE, Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce.com Corporation and others serve as examples of how we are working together with our partners to create next-generation Information Management solutions and deliver them to market. We will continue to look for ways to create more customer value from our strategic partnerships.\nDeliver Organic Growth. \nWe are focused on investing and delivering on organic growth. The Information Management market is large and is expected to continue to grow and we expect cloud to be our leading growth driver. We have multiple initiatives that are designed to deliver organic growth including; guiding our customers along their cloud journey, investing in our mid-market channel and deepening our relationships with our partners and hyperscalers. As customers move into the cloud, it will facilitate cross-sell and upsell opportunities across the product portfolio and geographies.\nExecute on Deleveraging Goals. \nAs part of the Micro Focus Acquisition, the Company announced an initiative to deleverage our balance sheet through the repayment of outstanding debt instruments utilizing the free cash flows generated from our combined operations. We intend to maintain our dividend during our deleveraging initiatives which is aimed at enhancing our continued commitment to returning value to our shareholders.\nSelectively Pursue Acquisitions.\n We expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to strengthen our service offerings in the Information Management market. Considering the continually evolving marketplace in which we operate, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities within the Information Management market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities. We plan to continue to pursue acquisitions that complement our existing business, represent a strong strategic fit and are consistent with our overall growth strategy and disciplined financial management. We may also target future acquisitions to expand or add functionality and capabilities to our existing portfolio of solutions, as well as add new solutions to our portfolio.\n16\nTable of Contents\nHuman Capital\nOur Global Footprint\nOur ability to attract, retain and engage a diverse workforce committed to innovation, operational excellence and the OpenText mission and values across our global footprint is a cornerstone to our success.\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, we employed a total of approximately 24,100 individuals, of which approximately 9,700 joined our workforce as part of the Micro Focus Acquisition. Of the total 24,100 individuals we employed as of June\u00a030, 2023, 9,050 or 38% are in the Americas, 5,750 or 24% are in EMEA and 9,300 or 38% are in Asia Pacific. Currently, we have employees in 45 countries enabling strong access to multiple talent pools while ensuring reach and proximity to our customers. Please see \u201cResults of Operations\u201d included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our definitions of geographic regions.\nThe approximate composition of our employee base is as follows: (i) 4,800 employees in sales and marketing, (ii)\u00a08,300 employees in product development, (iii) 3,700 employees in cloud services, (iv) 2,200 employees in professional services, (v)\u00a01,700 employees in customer support and (vi) 3,400 employees in general and administrative roles. \nWe believe that relations with our employees are strong. In certain jurisdictions, where it is customary to do so, a \u201cWorkers\u2019 Council\u201d or professional union represents our employees.\nEmployee Safety and Remote Work\nThe OpenText COVID-19 pandemic response program, Project Shield, evolved in Fiscal 2023 with the global lifting of COVID-19 safety restrictions. While active, Project Shield kept teams informed with comprehensive resources and current COVID-19 information, including a dedicated platform with helpful health and safety protocols for our employees returning to the office. \nAs of January 2023, all office-based employees were granted the flexibility to work from home up to 40% of their time. Project Shield worked alongside our internal teams to launch our flexible approach to return to the office. We continue to invest in software and hardware along with office redesign to support a flexible workforce where teams can collaborate and be productive. Using our offices in a purposeful way drives innovation, creativity and teamwork. Our past experiences continue to inform our future workplace standards and practices. See \u201cWe have a Flex-Office program, which subjects us to certain operational challenges and risks\u201d in Part I, Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nEmployee Engagement\nWe regularly conduct employee research to understand perceptions in the areas of engagement, company strategy, personal impact, manager effectiveness, recognition, career development and equity, diversity and inclusion. Participation level and engagement have remained high. Throughout the phases of the global health pandemic, employee communication and listening strategies increased, including supplemental surveys ranging from topics of well-being, feedback from new hires on the quality of their onboarding and office re-opening plans.\nEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance\nThe OpenText Zero-In Initiative is our commitment to our global impact goals and initiatives related to ESG. We believe the future of growth is sustainable and inclusive, and we commit to zero footprint, zero barriers and achieving our commitments with zero compromise through our purposeful goals to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040, zero waste from operations by 2030 and to be majority ethnically diverse among employees by 2030 with equal gender representation in key roles and 40% women in leadership positions at all management levels.\nOur charitable giving program supports activities at the local and global level, focused on education, innovation,\n \ndisaster relief and the health and welfare of children and families. We\n \nalso provide employees three paid days off to volunteer and make an impact to the causes that matter most to them. In addition, we launched the Navigator Internship Program to create pathways to digital jobs for Indigenous and under-represented minority students.\nTo operate long-term, we need to ensure that our local communities and the natural environment are thriving. We are committed to mitigating any adverse environmental impacts of our business activities, which at a minimum means abiding by all environmental laws, regulations and standards that apply to us. Our Environmental Policy articulates our commitment to measuring and managing our environmental impact.\n \nWe integrate the consideration of environmental concerns and impacts into our everyday decision making and business activities. Externally, we promote sustainable \n17\nTable of Contents\nconsumption by developing and promoting environmentally sound technologies to support our customers\u2019 digital transformations, including transitioning to the cloud environment. Internally, we continue to develop, implement and manage company-wide environmental initiatives.\nSee \u201cIncreased attention from shareholders, customers and other key relationships regarding our CSR and ESG practices could impact our business activities, financial performance and reputation\u201d in Part I, Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEquity, Diversity and Inclusion (ED&I)\nWe are passionate about creating an inclusive environment where skilled and diverse employees thrive, deliver compelling innovations to our customers and provide shareholder value. We are committed to increasing equity in opportunity for all employees regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion or other differences. \nAt OpenText, we have established a global Equity, Diversity and Inclusion steering committee to guide ED&I programs. We bring our ambition to life through impact teams made of employees who come together to recommend policies, programs and initiatives across a range of topics.\nOur impact teams are leading global initiatives with local impact which include: \n\u2022\nAwareness and Training: For employees and managers on matters such as inclusive leadership practices and diversity awareness;\n\u2022\nRecruiting: Platforms that are inclusive, diverse slates for key leadership roles and an increased focus on virtual work opportunities to widen recruiting talent and diversity;\n\u2022\nAdvancement: Internal career building opportunities, mentoring and networks;\n\u2022\nAdvocacy: Employee affinity groups, including \u201cBlack Employee Empowerment\u201d and \u201cWomen in Technology,\u201d fostering sponsorship, community and career conversations; and\n\u2022\nCivic Action: Focusing an ED&I lens on community outreach and engagement.\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur compensation philosophy is based on a set of principles that align with business strategy, reflect business and individual performance levels, consider market conditions to ensure competitiveness, demonstrate internal pay equity for similar roles and reflect the impact that economic conditions have on pay programs.\nOur compensation and benefit programs are regularly reviewed through an executive-sponsored governance process. Across the Company, we offer a wide variety of retirement and group benefits including medical, life and disability, which are designed to protect employees and their dependents against financial hardship due to illness or injury. Programs are designed to recognize the diversity of our work force and a range of well-being needs. We also have regional Employee Assistance Programs in many countries that provide 24/7 confidential counselling, support and access to resources for employees and their families. The OpenText Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is a global benefit program that allows all eligible employees to purchase OpenText shares at a 15% discount and provides the opportunity for employees to strengthen their ownership in the Company while enjoying the benefits of potential share price appreciation. \nInternal equity is a cornerstone of our goals. Our pay programs are carefully designed and governed, from hiring practices to consistency in progression rates for common roles. In designing variable pay for performance awards, we focus only on measurable outcomes rather than subjective measures. This ensures true equity in opportunity and awards tied to business results.\nEmployee Education, Training and Compliance\nWe know that employees join OpenText for continuous learning, experience and credentials to shape their careers. Our strategies focus on ensuring strong technical credentials, building capabilities, new skills sets and a high duty of care in ensuring ethical, secure and compliant practices. All employees have internal access to certification on OpenText and partner products.\nLeaders and managers play a key role in the engagement of employees. From a focus on high quality interviewing and onboarding of new hires to the importance of career development planning, we foster a culture and value proposition of career development. Internal applications to job postings are highly encouraged. Our annual Career Week event focuses on career development planning and honing manager skills in developing teams. \n18\nTable of Contents\nWe offer an annual education reimbursement program to all employees globally. This program aligns with our commitment to support internal development, equal opportunity and mobility across all of our geographies, regardless of an employee\u2019s role, function or location. We have designed the education reimbursement program to meet the needs of all personalized development goals through programs that range from technical to business skills. \nAs part of our commitment to the highest standards of conduct, all employees and contractors participate in an annual formal Compliance and Data Security Training, including Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Responsible Business Practices, Data Protection, Global Data Privacy Practices, Protecting Information and Preventing Sexual Harassment Training. These compliance programs ensure that we operate our business with integrity, following standard business ethics across the globe.\nAvailable Information\nOpenText Corporation was incorporated on June 26, 1991.

    "item1a": ">Item 1A.  Risk Factors \nThe following important factors could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from our current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections. These forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or made elsewhere by management from time to time are subject to important risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies. The risks discussed below are not necessarily presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence. \nYou should read these risk factors in conjunction with the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nIf we do not continue to develop technologically advanced products that successfully integrate with the software products and enhancements used by our customers, future revenues and our operating results may be negatively affected\nOur success depends upon our ability to design, develop, test, market, license, sell and support new software products and services and enhancements of current products and services on a timely basis in response to both competitive threats and marketplace demands. The software industry is increasingly focused on cloud computing, mobility, social media, SaaS and artificial intelligence, among other continually evolving shifts. In addition, our software products, services and enhancements must remain compatible with standard platforms and file formats. Often, we must integrate software licensed or acquired from third parties with our proprietary software to create new products or improve our existing products. If we are unable to achieve a successful integration with third party software, we may not be successful in developing and marketing our new software products, services and enhancements. If we are unable to successfully integrate third party software to develop new software products, services and enhancements to existing software products and services, or to complete the development of new software products and services which we license or acquire from third parties, our operating results will be materially adversely affected. In addition, if the integrated or new products or enhancements do not achieve acceptance by the marketplace, our operating results will be materially adversely affected. Moreover, if new industry standards emerge that we do not anticipate or adapt to, or, if alternatives to our services and solutions are developed by our competitors in times of rapid technological change, our software products and services could be rendered less competitive or obsolete, causing us to lose market share and, as a result, harm our business and operating results and our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nProduct development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and we may terminate one or more of our development programs\nWe may determine that certain software product candidates or programs do not have sufficient potential to warrant the continued allocation of resources. Accordingly, we may elect to terminate one or more of our programs for such product candidates. If we terminate a software product in development in which we have invested significant resources, our prospects may suffer, as we will have expended resources on a project that does not provide a return on our investment, and may have missed the opportunity to have allocated those resources to potentially more productive uses, which may negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur investment in our current research and development efforts may not provide a sufficient or timely return\nThe development of information management software products is a costly, complex and time-consuming process, and the investment in information management software product development often involves a long wait until a return is achieved on such an investment. We are making, and will continue to make, significant investments in software research and development and related product and service opportunities. Investments in new technology and processes are inherently speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including the degree of innovation of the software products and services developed through our research and development efforts, sufficient support from our strategic partners and effective distribution and marketing. Accelerated software product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development and the potential introduction of government regulation, including that related to the use of AI, may increase the costs of research and development. These expenditures may adversely affect our operating results if they are not offset by corresponding revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts in order to maintain our competitive position. However, significant revenues from new software product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new software products \n20\nTable of Contents\nand services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new software products and services may not be as high as the margins we have experienced for our current or historical software products and services.\nIf our software products and services do not gain market acceptance, our operating results may be negatively affected\nWe intend to pursue our strategy of being a market leading consolidator for cloud-based information management solutions. We intend to grow the capabilities of our information management software offerings through our proprietary research and the development of new software product and service offerings, as well as through acquisitions. It is important to our success that we continue to enhance our software products and services in response to customer demand and to seek to set the standard for information management capabilities. The primary market for our software products and services is rapidly evolving, and the level of acceptance of products and services that have been released recently, or that are planned for future release to the marketplace, is not certain. If the markets for our software products and services fail to develop, develop more slowly than expected or become subject to increased competition, our business may suffer. As a result, we may be unable to: (i) successfully market our current products and services; (ii) develop new software products and services and enhancements to current software products and services; (iii) complete customer implementations on a timely basis; or (iv) complete software products and services currently under development. In addition, increased competition and transitioning from perpetual license sales to subscription-based business model could put significant pricing pressures on our products, which could negatively impact our margins and profitability. If our software products and services are not accepted by our customers or by other businesses in the marketplace, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete effectively\nWe are highly dependent on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, to establish and maintain our proprietary rights. We intend to protect our intellectual property rights vigorously; however, there can be no assurance that these measures will, in all cases, be successful, and these measures can be costly and/or subject us to counterclaims, including challenges to the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights may be difficult, particularly in some countries outside of North America in which we seek to market our software products and services. While Canadian and U.S. copyright laws, international conventions and international treaties may provide meaningful protection against unauthorized duplication of software, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of Canada or the United States. The absence of internationally harmonized intellectual property laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent protection of our proprietary rights. Software piracy has been, and is expected to be, a persistent problem for the software industry, and piracy of our software products represents a loss of revenue to us. Where applicable, certain of our license arrangements have required us to make a limited confidential disclosure of portions of the source code for our software products, or to place such source code into escrow for the protection of another party. Despite the precautions we have taken, unauthorized third parties, including our competitors, may be able to copy certain portions of our software products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Our competitive position may be adversely affected by our possible inability to effectively protect our intellectual property. In addition, certain of our products contain open source software. Licensees of open source software may be required to make public certain source code, to license proprietary software for free or to permit others to create derivative works of proprietary software. While we monitor and control the use of open source software in our products and in any third party software that is incorporated into our products, and try to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way that negatively affects our proprietary software, there can be no guarantee that such use does not occur inadvertently, which in turn, could harm our intellectual property position and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, any undetected errors or defects in open source software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our software products, delay the introduction of new solutions, or render our software more vulnerable to breaches or security attacks.\nOther companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, which could materially increase costs and materially harm our ability to generate future revenues and profits\nClaims of infringement (including misappropriation and/or other intellectual property violation) are common in the software industry and increasing as related legal protections, including copyrights and patents, are applied to software products. Although most of our technology is proprietary in nature, we do include certain third party and open source software in our software products. In the case of third-party software, we believe this software is licensed from the entity holding the intellectual property rights. While we believe that we have secured proper licenses for all material third-party intellectual property that is integrated into our products in a manner that requires a license, third parties have and may continue to assert infringement claims against us in the future. In particular, our efforts to protect our intellectual property through patent litigation may result in counterclaims of patent infringement by counterparties in such suits. Any such assertion, regardless of merit, may result in litigation or require us to obtain a license for the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such licenses \n21\nTable of Contents\nmay not be available, or they may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, as we continue to develop software products and expand our portfolio using new technology and innovation, our exposure to threats of infringement may increase. Any infringement claims and related litigation could be time-consuming and disruptive to our ability to generate revenues or enter into new market opportunities and may result in significantly increased costs as a result of our defense against those claims or our attempt to license the intellectual property rights or rework our products to avoid infringement of third-party rights. Typically, our agreements with our partners and customers contain provisions that require us to indemnify them for damages sustained by them as a result of any infringement claims involving our products. Any of the foregoing infringement claims and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results as well as on our ability to generate future revenues and profits.\nOur software products and services may contain defects that could harm our reputation, be costly to correct, delay revenues and expose us to litigation\nOur software products and services are highly complex and sophisticated and, from time to time, may contain design defects, software errors, hardware failures or other computer system failures that are difficult to detect and correct. Errors, defects and/or other failures may be found in new software products or services or improvements to existing products or services after delivery to our customers, including as a result of the introduction of new and emerging technologies such as AI. If these defects, errors and/or other failures are discovered, we may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner. In addition, despite the extensive tests we conduct on all our software products or services, we may not be able to fully simulate the environment in which our products or services will operate and, as a result, we may be unable to adequately detect the design defects or software or hardware errors that may become apparent only after the products are installed in an end-user\u2019s network, and only after users have transitioned to our services. The occurrence of errors, defects and/or other failures in our software products or services could result in the delay or the denial of market acceptance of our products and alleviating such errors, defects and/or other failures may require us to make significant expenditure of our resources. Customers often use our services and solutions for critical business processes and, as a result, any defect or disruption in our solutions, any data breaches or misappropriation of proprietary information or any error in execution, including human error or intentional third-party activity such as denial of service attacks or hacking, may cause customers to reconsider renewing their contracts with us. The errors in or failure of our software products and services could also result in us losing customer transaction documents and other customer files, causing significant customer dissatisfaction and possibly giving rise to claims for monetary damages. The harm to our reputation resulting from product and service errors, defects and/or other failures may be material. Since we regularly provide a warranty with our software products, the financial impact of fulfilling warranty obligations may be significant in the future. Our agreements with our strategic partners and end-users typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to claims. These agreements regularly contain terms such as the exclusion of all implied warranties and the limitation of the availability of consequential or incidental damages. However, such provisions may not effectively protect us against claims and the attendant liabilities and costs associated with such claims. Any claims for actual or alleged losses to our customers\u2019 businesses may require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or arbitration or to pay significant sums in settlements or damages. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of merit, can be costly and would divert management\u2019s attention and resources. Although we maintain errors and omissions insurance coverage and comprehensive liability insurance coverage, such coverage may not be adequate to cover all such claims. Accordingly, any such claim could negatively affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur software products rely on the stability of infrastructure software that, if not stable, could negatively impact the effectiveness of our products, resulting in harm to our reputation and business\nOur development of Internet and intranet applications depends on the stability, functionality and scalability of the infrastructure software of the underlying intranet, such as the infrastructure software produced by Hewlett-Packard, Oracle, Microsoft and others. If weaknesses in such infrastructure software exist, we may not be able to correct or compensate for such weaknesses. If we are unable to address weaknesses resulting from problems in the infrastructure software such that our software products do not meet customer needs or expectations, our reputation, and consequently, our business, may be significantly harmed.\nRisks associated with the evolving use of the Internet, including changing standards, competition and regulation and associated compliance efforts, may adversely impact our business\nThe use of the Internet as a vehicle for electronic data interchange (EDI) and related services continues to raise numerous issues, including those relating to reliability, data security, data integrity and rapidly evolving standards. New competitors, including media, software vendors and telecommunications companies, offer products and services that utilize the Internet in competition with our products and services, which may be less expensive or process transactions and data faster and more efficiently. Internet-based commerce is subject to increasing regulation by Canadian, U.S. federal and state and foreign governments, including in the areas of data privacy and breaches and taxation. Laws and regulations relating to the solicitation, \n22\nTable of Contents\ncollection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers\u2019 ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for Internet-based solutions and restricting our ability to store, process, analyze and share data through the Internet. Although we believe that the Internet will continue to provide opportunities to expand the use of our products and services, we cannot guarantee that our efforts to capitalize on these opportunities will be successful or that increased usage of the Internet for business integration products and services, increased competition or heightened regulation will not adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBusiness disruptions, including those arising from disasters, pandemics or catastrophic events, may adversely affect our operations\nOur business and operations are highly automated, and a disruption or failure of our systems may delay our ability to complete sales and to provide services. Business disruptions can be caused by several factors, including climate change, natural disasters, global health pandemics, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications and system failures, computer viruses, physical attacks and cyber-attacks. A major disaster or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems, including our cloud services, could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations. We operate data centers in various locations around the world and although we have redundancy capability built into our disaster recovery plan, we cannot ensure that our systems and data centers will remain fully operational during and immediately after a disaster or disruption. We also rely on third parties that provide critical services in our operations and despite our diligence around their disaster recovery processes, we cannot provide assurances as to whether these third-party service providers can maintain operations during a disaster or disruption. Global climate change may also aggravate natural disasters and increase severe weather events that affect our business operations, thereby compelling us to build additional resiliency in order to mitigate their impact. Further, in the event of any future global health pandemic, certain measures or restrictions may be imposed or recommended by governments, public institutions and other organizations, which could disrupt economic activity and result in reduced commercial and consumer confidence and spending, increased unemployment, closure or restricted operating conditions for businesses, inflation, volatility in the global economy, instability in the credit and financial markets, labour shortages and disruption in supply chains. Any business disruption could negatively affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nUnauthorized disclosures, cyber-attacks, breaches of data security and other information technology risks may adversely affect our operations\nMost of the jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, security and protection of information. We have certain measures to protect our information systems against unauthorized access and disclosure of personal information and of our confidential information and confidential information belonging to our customers. We have policies and procedures in place dealing with data security and records retention. These measures and policies may change over time as laws and regulations regarding data privacy, security and protection of information change. However, there is no assurance that the security measures we have put in place will be effective in every case, and our response process to incidents may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to prevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. Failures and breaches in security could result in a negative impact for us and for our customers, adversely affecting our and our customers\u2019 businesses, assets, revenues, brands and reputations, disrupting our operations and resulting in penalties, fines, litigation, regulatory proceedings, regulatory investigations, increase insurance premiums, remediation efforts, indemnification expenditures, reputational harm, negative publicity, lost revenues and/or other potential liabilities, in each case depending on the nature of the information disclosed. Security breaches could also affect our relations with our customers, damage our reputation and harm our ability to keep existing customers and to attract new customers. Some jurisdictions, including all U.S. states and the European Union (EU), have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data, and in some cases our agreements with certain customers require us to notify them in the event of a data security incident. Such mandatory disclosures could lead to negative publicity and may cause our current and prospective customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. These circumstances could also result in adverse impact on the market price of our Common Shares. These risks to our business may increase as we expand the number of web-based and cloud-based products, systems and solutions we offer and as we increase the number of countries in which we operate.\nIn particular, we are increasingly relying on virtual environments and communications systems, which have been in recent years and may be in the future subjected to third-party vulnerabilities and security risks of increasing frequency, scope and potential harm. Malicious hackers may attempt to gain access to our network or data centers; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, systems, solutions, employees and customers; interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others; or attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities in our products, systems or solutions, and such acts may go undetected. Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated cybercrimes and cyberattacks, including computer viruses and other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial-of-service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking, and other types of attacks, pose a risk to the security and availability of our information technology \n23\nTable of Contents\nsystems, networks, products, solutions and services, including those that are managed, hosted, provided, or used by third parties (and which may not provide the same level of information security as our own products, systems or solutions), as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and the data of our customers, partners, consumers, employees, stockholders, suppliers and others. Although we monitor our networks and continue to enhance our security protections, hackers are increasingly more sophisticated and aggressive and change tactics frequently, and our efforts may be inadequate to prevent or mitigate all incidents of data breach or theft. A series of issues may also be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. Furthermore, it is possible that the risk of cyber-attacks and other data security breaches or thefts to us or our customers may increase due to global geo-political uncertainty, in particular such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nIn addition, if data security is compromised, this could materially and adversely affect our operating results given that we have customers that use our systems to store and exchange large volumes of proprietary and confidential information and the security and reliability of our services are of significant importance to these customers. We have experienced attempts by third parties to identify and exploit product and services vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers\u2019 or service providers\u2019 cloud offerings and other products, systems or solutions. We may experience future security issues, whether due to human error or misconduct, system errors or vulnerabilities in our or our third-party service providers\u2019 products, systems or solutions. If our products, systems or solutions, or the products, systems or solutions of third-party service providers on whom we rely or may rely in the future, are attacked or accessed by unauthorized parties, it could lead to major disruption or denial of service and access to or loss, modification or theft of our and our customers\u2019 data, which may require us to spend material financial or other resources on correcting the breach and indemnifying the relevant parties and/or on litigation, regulatory investigations, regulatory proceedings, increased insurance premiums, lost revenues, penalties, reputational harm, negative publicity, fines and/or other potential liabilities. If third-party service providers fail to implement adequate data security practices or otherwise suffer a security breach, our or our customer\u2019s data may be improperly accessed, disclosed, used or otherwise lost, which could lead to reputational, business, operating and financial harms. Our efforts to protect against cyber-attacks and data breaches, including increased risks associated with work from home measures, may not be sufficient to prevent or mitigate such incidents, which could have material adverse effects on our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition\n.\nOur success depends on our relationships with strategic partners, distributors and third-party service providers and any reduction in the sales efforts by distributors, cooperative efforts from our partners or service from third party providers could materially impact our revenues\nWe rely on close cooperation with strategic partners for sales and software product development as well as for the optimization of opportunities that arise in our competitive environment. A portion of our license revenues is derived from the licensing of our software products through third parties. Also, a portion of our service revenues may be impacted by the level of service provided by third party service providers relating to Internet, telecommunications and power services. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to maintain access to and grow existing channels of distribution and to gain access to new channels if and when they develop. We may not be able to retain a sufficient number of our existing distributors or develop a sufficient number of future distributors. Distributors may also give higher priority to the licensing or sale of software products and services other than ours (which could include competitors\u2019 products and services) or may not devote sufficient resources to marketing our software products and services. The performance of third party distributors and third party service providers is largely outside of our control, and we are unable to predict the extent to which these distributors and service providers will be successful in either marketing and licensing or selling our software products and services or providing adequate Internet, telecommunication and power services so that disruptions and outages are not experienced by our customers. A reduction in strategic partner cooperation or sales efforts, a decline in the number of distributors, a decision by our distributors to discontinue the licensing of our software products or a decline or disruption in third party services could cause users and the general public to perceive our software products and services as inferior and could materially reduce our revenues. In addition, our financial results could be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of our distributors or third-party service providers were to weaken. Some of our distributors and third-party service providers may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic weakness, industry consolidation and market trends.\nThe loss of licenses to resell or use third-party software or the lack of support or enhancement of such software could adversely affect our business\nWe currently depend upon a limited number of third-party software products. If such software products were not available, we might experience delays or increased costs in the development of our own software products. For a limited number of our product modules, we rely on software products that we license from third parties, including software that is integrated with internally developed software and which is used in our products to perform key functions. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms and the related software may not \n24\nTable of Contents\ncontinue to be appropriately supported, maintained or enhanced by the licensors. The loss by us of the license to use, or the inability by licensors to support, maintain or enhance any such software, could result in increased costs, lost revenues or delays until equivalent software is internally developed or licensed from another third party and integrated with our software. Such increased costs, lost revenues or delays could adversely affect our business. For example, with our acquisition of Zix, we extended our partnership with Microsoft by becoming one of their authorized Cloud Solutions Providers in North America. If our key partners were to terminate our relationship, make an adverse change in their reseller program, change their product offerings or experience a major cyber-attack or similar event, it could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business.\nCurrent and future competitors could have a significant impact on our ability to generate future revenues and profits\nThe markets for our software products and services are intensely competitive and are subject to rapid technological change and other pressures created by changes in our industry. The convergence of many technologies has resulted in unforeseen competitors arising from companies that were traditionally not viewed as threats to our market position. We expect competition to increase and intensify in the future as the pace of technological change and adaptation quickens and as additional companies enter our markets, including those competitors who offer solutions similar to ours, but offer it through a different form of delivery. Numerous releases of competitive products have occurred in recent history and are expected to continue in the future. We may not be able to compete effectively with current competitors and potential entrants into our marketplace. We could lose market share if our current or prospective competitors: (i) develop technologies that are perceived to be substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies; (ii) introduce new competitive products or services; (iii) add new functionality to existing products and services, including through new and emerging AI applications; (iv) acquire competitive products and services; (v) reduce prices; or (vi) form strategic alliances or cooperative relationships with other companies. If other businesses were to engage in aggressive pricing policies with respect to competing products, or if the dynamics in our marketplace resulted in increasing bargaining power by the consumers of our software products and services, we would need to lower the prices we charge for the products and services we offer. This could result in lower revenues or reduced margins, either of which may materially adversely affect our business and operating results. Moreover, our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers, distributors or third-party service providers. Additionally, if prospective consumers choose methods of information management delivery different from that which we offer, our business and operating results could also be materially adversely affected.\nThe length of our sales cycle can fluctuate significantly which could result in significant fluctuations in revenues being recognized from quarter to quarter\nThe decision by a customer to license our software products or purchase our services often involves a comprehensive implementation process across the customer\u2019s network or networks. As a result, the licensing and implementation of our software products and any related services may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers, accompanied by the attendant risks and delays frequently associated with significant technology implementation projects. Given the significant investment and commitment of resources required by an organization to implement our software products, our sales cycle may be longer compared to other companies within our own industry, as well as companies in other industries. Also, because of changes in customer spending habits, it may be difficult for us to budget, forecast and allocate our resources properly. In weak economic environments, such as a recession or slowdown, it is not uncommon to see reduced information technology spending. It may take several months, or even several quarters, for marketing opportunities to materialize, especially following a prolonged period of weak economic environment. If a customer\u2019s decision to license our software or purchase our services is delayed or if the implementation of these software products takes longer than originally anticipated, the date on which we may recognize revenues from these licenses or sales would be delayed. Such delays and fluctuations could cause our revenues to be lower than expected in a particular period and we may not be able to adjust our costs quickly enough to offset such lower revenues, potentially negatively impacting our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur existing customers might cancel contracts with us, fail to renew contracts on their renewal dates and/or fail to purchase additional services and products, and we may be unable to attract new customers, which could adversely affect our operating results\nWe depend on our installed customer base for a significant portion of our revenues. We have significant contracts with our license customers for ongoing support and maintenance, as well as significant service contracts that provide recurring services revenues to us. In addition, our installed customer base has historically generated additional new license and services revenues for us. Service contracts are generally renewable at a customer\u2019s option and/or subject to cancellation rights, and there are generally no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software or subscribe for additional services.\n25\nTable of Contents\nIf our customers cancel or fail to renew their service contracts or fail to purchase additional services or products, then our revenues could decrease, and our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Factors influencing such contract terminations and failure to purchase additional services or products could include changes in the financial circumstances of our customers, including as a result of any potential recession, dissatisfaction with our products or services, our retirement or lack of support for our legacy products and services, our customers selecting or building alternate technologies to replace our products or services, the cost of our products and services as compared to the cost of products and services offered by our competitors, acceptance of future price increases by us, including due to inflationary pressures, our ability to attract, hire and maintain qualified personnel to meet customer needs, consolidating activities in the market, changes in our customers\u2019 business or in regulation impacting our customers\u2019 business that may no longer necessitate the use of our products or services, general economic or market conditions, or other reasons. Further, our customers could delay or terminate implementations or use of our services and products or be reluctant to migrate to new products. Such customers will not generate the revenues we may have expected within the anticipated timelines, or at all, and may be less likely to invest in additional services or products from us in the future. We may not be able to adjust our expense levels quickly enough to account for any such revenue losses.\nConsolidation in the industry, particularly by large, well-capitalized companies, could place pressure on our operating margins which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business\nAcquisitions by large, well-capitalized technology companies have changed the marketplace for our software products and services by replacing competitors that are comparable in size to our Company with companies that have more resources at their disposal to compete with us in the marketplace. In addition, other large corporations with considerable financial resources either have products and/or services that compete with our software products and services or have the ability to encroach on our competitive position within our marketplace. These companies have considerable financial resources, channel influence and broad geographic reach; thus, they can engage in competition with our software products and services on the basis of price, marketing, services or support. They also have the ability to introduce items that compete with our maturing software products and services. The threat posed by larger competitors and their ability to use their better economies of scale to sell competing products and/or services at a lower cost may materially reduce the profit margins we earn on the software products and services we provide to the marketplace. Any material reduction in our profit margin may have a material adverse effect on the operations or finances of our business, which could hinder our ability to raise capital in the public markets at opportune times for strategic acquisitions or for general operational purposes, which may then, in turn, prevent effective strategic growth or improved economies of scale or put us at a disadvantage to our better capitalized competitors.\nWe may be unable to maintain or expand our base of SMB and consumer customers, which could adversely affect our anticipated future growth and operating results\nWith the acquisitions of Carbonite and Zix, we have expanded our presence in the SMB market as well as the consumer market. Expanding in this market may require substantial resources and increased marketing efforts, different to what we are accustomed to historically. If we are unable to market and sell our solutions to the SMB market and consumers with competitive pricing and in a cost-effective manner, it may harm our ability to grow our revenues and adversely affect our anticipated future growth and operating results. In addition, SMBs frequently have limited budgets and are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established companies. As such, SMBs may choose to spend funds on items other than our solutions, particularly during difficult economic times, which may hurt our projected revenues, business financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales to government clients expose us to business volatility and risks, including government budgeting cycles and appropriations, early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties\nWe derive revenues from contracts with U.S. and Canadian federal, state, provincial and local governments and other foreign governments and their respective agencies, which may terminate most of these contracts at any time, without cause. There is increased pressure on governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Further, our U.S. federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations made by the U.S. Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts with U.S. state and local governments, Canadian federal, provincial and local governments and other foreign governments and their agencies are generally subject to government funding authorizations. Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations that could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.\n26\nTable of Contents\nGeopolitical instability, political unrest, war and other global conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has affected and may continue to affect our business\nGeopolitical instability, political unrest, war and other global conflicts may result in adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including volatility in financial markets, adverse changes in trade policies, inflation, higher interest rates, direct and indirect supply chain disruptions, increased cybersecurity threats and fluctuations in foreign currency. These events may also impact our decision or limit our ability to conduct business in certain areas or with certain entities. For example, in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, we ceased all direct business in Russia and Belarus and with known Russian-owned companies. Sanctions and export controls have also been imposed by the United States, Canada and other countries in connection with Russia\u2019s military actions in Ukraine, including restrictions on selling or exporting goods, services or technology to certain regions, and travel bans and asset freezes impacting political, military, business and financial organizations and individuals in or connected with Russia. To support certain of our cloud customers headquartered in the United States or allied countries that rely on our network to manage their global business (including their business in Russia), we have nonetheless allowed these customers to continue to use our services to the extent that it can be done in strict compliance with all applicable sanctions and export controls. However, as the situation continues and the regulatory environment further evolves, we may adjust our business practices as required by applicable rules and regulations. Our compliance with sanctions and export controls could impact the fulfillment of certain contracts with customers and partners doing business in these affected areas and future revenue streams from impacted parties and certain countries. While our decision to cease all direct business in Russia and Belarus and with known Russian-owned companies has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition, it is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict or other conflicts, which could include sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, changes to regional trade ecosystems, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on the global economy, on our business and operations as well as those of our customers, partners and third party service providers.\nThe restructuring of certain of our operations may be ineffective, may adversely affect our business and our finances, and we may incur additional restructuring charges in connection with such actions \nWe often undertake initiatives to restructure or streamline our operations, particularly during the period post-acquisition, such as the Micro Focus Acquisition Restructuring Plan (as defined below). We may incur costs associated with implementing a restructuring initiative beyond the amount contemplated when we first developed the initiative, and these increased costs may be substantial. Additionally, such costs would adversely impact our results of operations for the periods in which those adjustments are made. We will continue to evaluate our operations and may propose future restructuring actions as a result of changes in the marketplace, including the exit from less profitable operations, the decision to terminate products or services that are not valued by our customers or adjusting our workforce. Any failure to successfully execute these initiatives on a timely basis may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor example, during the third quarter of Fiscal 2022, we made a strategic decision to implement restructuring activities to streamline our operations and further reduce our real estate footprint around the world (Fiscal 2022 Restructuring Plan). Such steps to reduce costs, and further changes we may make in the future, may negatively impact our business, operations and financial performance in a manner that is difficult to predict. \nFor more information on our Micro Focus Acquisition Restructuring Plan and our Fiscal 2022 Restructuring Plan, see Note\u00a018 \u201cSpecial Charges (Recoveries)\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have a Flex-Office program, which subjects us to certain operational challenges and risks\nIn July 2022, we implemented a Flex-Office program in which a majority of our employees work a portion of their time in the office and a portion remotely. As a result, we continue to be subject to the challenges and risks of having a remote work environment, as well as new operational challenges and risks from having a flexible workforce. \nFor example, employing a remote work environment could affect employee productivity, including due to a lower level of employee oversight, health conditions or illnesses, disruptions due to caregiving or childcare obligations or slower or unreliable Internet access. OpenText systems, client, vendor and/or borrower data may be subject to additional risks presented by increased cyber-attacks and phishing activities targeting employees, vendors, third party service providers and counterparties in transactions, the possibility of attacks on OpenText systems or systems of employees working remotely as well as by decreased physical supervision. In addition, we may rely, in part, on third-party service providers to assist us in managing monitoring and otherwise carrying out aspects of our business and operations. Such events may result in a period of business disruption or reduced operations, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While our controls were not specifically designed to operate in a home environment, we believe that established internal controls over financial reporting continue to address all identified risk areas. \n27\nTable of Contents\nThe transition to a flexible workforce may also subject us to other operational challenges and risks. For example, our shift to a Flex-Office program may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain personnel who prefer a fully remote or fully in-person work environment. Operating our business with both remote and in-person workers, or workers who work on flexible schedules, could have a negative impact on our corporate culture, decrease the ability of our employees to collaborate and communicate effectively, decrease innovation and productivity, or negatively affect employee morale. In addition, we have incurred costs related to our return to office planning and the transition to a flexible workforce, including due to reducing our real estate footprint around the world. If we are unable to effectively continue the transition to a flexible workforce, manage the cybersecurity and other risks of remote work, and maintain our corporate culture and employee morale, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely impacted.\nFor more information regarding the impact of business disruptions on our cybersecurity, see \u201cBusiness disruptions, including those arising from disasters, pandemics or catastrophic events, may adversely affect our operations.\u201d\nWe must continue to manage our internal resources during periods of company growth, or our operating results could be adversely affected\nThe information management market in which we compete continues to evolve at a rapid pace. We have grown significantly through acquisitions, including through the Micro Focus Acquisition, and, in conjunction with our plan to de-lever, may continue to review acquisition opportunities as a means of increasing the size and scope of our business. Our growth, coupled with the rapid evolution of our markets, has placed, and will continue to place, significant strains on our administrative and operational resources and increased demands on our internal systems, procedures and controls. Our administrative infrastructure, systems, procedures and controls may not adequately support our operations. In addition, our management may not be able to achieve the rapid, effective execution of the product and business initiatives necessary to successfully implement our operational and competitive strategy. If we are unable to manage growth effectively, our operating results will likely suffer, which may, in turn, adversely affect our business.\nIf we lose the services of our executive officers or other key employees or if we are not able to attract or retain top employees, our business could be significantly harmed\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees and there is a risk that we could lose their services. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. Our success is also highly dependent on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train, retain and motivate highly qualified management, technical, sales and marketing personnel. In particular, the recruitment and retention of top research developers and experienced salespeople, particularly those with specialized knowledge, remains critical to our success, including providing consistent and uninterrupted service to our customers. Competition for such people is intense, substantial and continuous, and we may not be able to attract, integrate or retain highly qualified technical, sales or managerial personnel in the future. In our effort to attract and retain critical personnel, and in responding to inflationary wage pressure, we may experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher prices for our software products or services. In addition, the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur compensation structure may hinder our efforts to attract and retain vital employees\nA portion of our total compensation program for our executive officers and key personnel includes the award of options to buy our Common Shares. If the market price of our Common Shares performs poorly, such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel. In addition, any changes made to our stock option policies, or to any other of our compensation practices, which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures, could adversely affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel. For example, any limit to total compensation that may be prescribed by the government or applicable regulatory authorities or any significant increases in personal income tax levels levied in countries where we have a significant operational presence may hurt our ability to attract or retain our executive officers or other employees whose efforts are vital to our success. Additionally, payments under our long-term incentive plans (the details of which are described in Item 11 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) are dependent to a significant extent upon the future performance of our Company both in absolute terms and in comparison to similarly situated companies. Any failure to achieve the targets set under our long-term incentive plan could significantly reduce or eliminate payments made under this plan, which may, in turn, materially and adversely affect our ability to retain the key personnel paid under this plan.\n28\nTable of Contents\nIncreased attention from shareholders, customers and other key relationships regarding our CSR and ESG  practices could impact our business activities, financial performance and reputation\nShareholders, customers and other key relationships are placing a greater emphasis on CSR and ESG factors when evaluating companies for business and investment opportunities. We actively manage a broad range of CSR and ESG matters and annually publish a Corporate Citizenship Report regarding our policies and practices on a variety of CSR and ESG matters, including our: governance framework; community involvement; ED&I initiatives; employee health and safety; targets regarding greenhouse gas emissions, waste diversion and energy consumption; and practices relating to data privacy and information security. Our approach to and disclosure of CSR and ESG matters may result in increased attention from our shareholders, customers, employees, partners and suppliers, and such key relationships may not be satisfied with our approach to CSR and ESG as compared to their expectations and standards, which continue to evolve. Additionally, third-party organizations evaluate our approach to CSR and ESG, and an unfavorable rating on CSR or ESG from such organizations could lead to negative investor sentiment and reduced demand for our securities and damage to our reputation, as well as damage to our relationships with shareholders, customers, employees, partners and suppliers, which could have adverse effects on our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition. See \u201cChanges in the market price of our Common Shares and credit ratings of our outstanding debt securities could lead to losses for shareholders and debt holders.\u201d \nThe Company has disclosed the OpenText Zero-In Initiative, where we have committed to: (1) science-based GHG emissions target of 50% reduction by 2030, and net zero GHG emissions by 2040; (2) zero waste from operations by 2030; and (3) by 2030, a majority ethnically diverse staff, with 50/50 representation in key roles and 40% women in leadership positions at all management levels. Achieving our targets and ongoing compliance with evolving laws and regulatory requirements may cause us to reconfigure facilities and operations or adjust our existing processes. This could result in significant unexpected expenses, changes in our relationships with certain strategic partners, distributors and third-party service providers, loss of revenue and business disruption. We may not meet our goals in the manner or on such a timeline as initially contemplated, or at all, which would have adverse effects on our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.\nFurther, we may incur additional costs and require additional resources to be able to collect reliable emissions and waste data (in part, due to unavailable third-party data or inconsistent industry standards on the measurement of certain data), measure our performance against our targets and adjust our disclosure in line with market expectations. We may also incur additional compliance costs under evolving ESG-related regulations across the world, including in the EU, the U.S. and Canada. If we fail to meet our ESG targets or other ESG criteria set by third parties on a timely basis, or at all, or fail to respond to any perceived ESG concerns, or regulators disagree with our procedures or standards, our business activities, financial performance and reputation may be adversely affected. \nRisks Related to Acquisitions\nAcquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other business initiatives may negatively affect our operating results\nThe growth of our Company through the successful acquisition and integration of complementary businesses is a critical component of our corporate strategy. As a result of the continually evolving marketplace in which we operate, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities. We plan to continue to pursue acquisitions that complement our existing business, represent a strong strategic fit and are consistent with our overall growth strategy and disciplined financial management. We may also target future acquisitions to expand or add functionality and capabilities to our existing portfolio of solutions, as well as to add new solutions to our portfolio. We may also consider, from time to time, opportunities to engage in joint ventures or other business collaborations with third parties to address particular market segments. These activities create risks such as: (i) the need to integrate and manage the businesses and products acquired with our own business and products; (ii) additional demands on our resources, systems, procedures and controls; (iii) disruption of our ongoing business; and (iv) diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Moreover, these transactions could involve: (i) substantial investment of funds or financings by issuance of debt or equity or equity-related securities; (ii) substantial investment with respect to technology transfers and operational integration; and (iii) the acquisition or disposition of product lines or businesses. Also, such activities could result in charges and expenses and have the potential to either dilute the interests of existing shareholders or result in the issuance or assumption of debt, which could have a negative impact on the credit ratings of our outstanding debt securities or the market price of our Common Shares. Such acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or other business collaborations may involve significant commitments of financial and other resources of our Company. Any such activity may not be successful in generating revenues, income or other returns to us, and the resources committed to such activities will not be available to us for other purposes. In addition, while we conduct due diligence prior to consummating an acquisition, joint venture or business collaboration, such diligence may not identify all material issues associated with such activities and we may be exposed to additional risk due to such acquisition, joint venture or business collaboration. We may also experience unanticipated difficulties identifying suitable or attractive acquisition candidates that are available for purchase at reasonable prices. Even if we are able to identify such candidates, we may be unable to consummate an acquisition on suitable terms or in the face of \n29\nTable of Contents\ncompetition from other bidders. Moreover, if we are unable to access capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions, or may have to do so on the basis of a less than optimal capital structure. Our inability (i) to take advantage of growth opportunities for our business or for our products and services, or (ii) to address risks associated with acquisitions or investments in businesses, may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in an acquisition or in an investment, or charges associated with any acquisition or investment activity, may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition which, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Shares or credit ratings of our outstanding debt securities.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, including the Micro Focus Acquisition, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected\nWe may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of our acquisitions, including the acquisition of Micro Focus. As we integrate our acquisitions, we may experience disruptions to our business and, if implemented ineffectively, it could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe anticipated benefits we expect from having consummated the Micro Focus Acquisition are, necessarily, based on projections and assumptions about our combined business with Micro Focus, which may not materialize as expected or which may prove to be inaccurate. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from the Micro Focus Acquisition on a timely basis or at all, including realizing the anticipated synergies from the Micro Focus Acquisition in the anticipated amounts or at all and within the anticipated timeframes or cost expectations, including implementing the Micro Focus Acquisition Restructuring Plan. Achieving the benefits of the Micro Focus Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the business and operations of Micro Focus successfully and efficiently with our business. See \u201cWe may be unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses or do so within the intended timeframes, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\u201d\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, including restructuring charges, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses or do so within the intended timeframes, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquired businesses, including the Micro Focus Acquisition, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate acquired businesses and operations with our own. The integration of acquired businesses with our existing business will be complex, costly and time-consuming, and may result in additional demands on our resources, systems, procedures and controls, disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Although we cannot be certain of the degree and scope of operational and integration problems that may arise, the difficulties and risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses, which may be complex and time-consuming, may include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe increased scope and complexity of our operations;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically separate organizations, operations, relationships and facilities, including coordinating and integrating (i) independent research and development and engineering teams across technologies and product platforms to enhance product development while reducing costs and (ii) sales and marketing efforts to effectively position the combined company\u2019s capabilities and the direction of product development;\n\u2022\nintegrating (i) personnel with diverse business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies, and (ii) the standards, policies and compensation structures, as well as the complex systems, technology, networks and other assets, of the businesses;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully managing relationships with our strategic partners and combined supplier and customer base;\n\u2022\nimplementing expected cost synergies of the acquisitions, including expected cost synergies of $400 million relating to the Micro Focus Acquisition;\n\u2022\nretention of key employees;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management attention from other important business objectives;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we may have failed to discover obligations of acquired businesses or risks associated with those businesses during our due diligence investigations as part of the acquisition, which we, as a successor owner, may be responsible for or subject to; and\n30\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nprovisions in contracts with third parties that may limit flexibility to take certain actions.\nAs a result of these difficulties and risks, we may not accomplish the integration of acquired businesses smoothly, successfully or within our budgetary expectations and anticipated timetables, which may result in a failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions.\nAs a result of the Micro Focus Acquisition, the scope and size of our operations and business has substantially changed and will result in certain incremental risks to us. We cannot provide assurance that our expansion in scope and size will be successful\nThe Micro Focus Acquisition has substantially expanded the scope and size of our business by adding substantial assets and operations to our previously existing business. The anticipated future growth of our business will impose significant added responsibilities on management, including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees. Our senior management\u2019s attention may be diverted from the management of daily operations and other important business objectives to the integration of the assets acquired in the Micro Focus Acquisition. Our ability to manage our business and growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. We may also encounter risks, costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or other unanticipated liabilities and use more cash and other financial resources on integration and implementation activities than we expect. We may not be able to integrate the Micro Focus business into our existing operations on our anticipated timelines or realize the full expected economic benefits of the Micro Focus Acquisition, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, as permitted by applicable rules and laws, we have excluded Micro Focus from the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023. See \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d\nWe may also encounter risk, costs and expenses associated with preparing periodic reporting and consolidated financial statements now that the Micro Focus Acquisition has closed. The expansion of effective internal controls over financial reporting and adequate disclosure controls and procedures over the Micro Focus business will be necessary to provide reliable financial reports and reporting. Micro Focus identified a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, which was subsequently remediated. In the course of applying our internal controls framework to the Micro Focus business we may identify other material weaknesses, significant deficiencies or other deficiencies, which could result in our determining we have a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting, and lead to an adverse reaction in the financial markets and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects. Also, Micro Focus\u2019 historical financial statements were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and have not been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Prior to the Micro Focus Acquisition, Micro Focus provided financial statements semi-annually, with a fiscal year end of October 31. Given such differences, it may be difficult for us to integrate systems in a timely fashion to continue to produce financial statements now that the Micro Focus Acquisition has closed.\nWe incurred significant transaction costs in connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition, and could incur unanticipated costs during the integration of Micro Focus that could adversely affect our results of operations\nWe incurred significant transaction costs in connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition, including payment of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition and related transactions to obtain financing for the Micro Focus Acquisition, including entering into certain derivative transactions as further described herein. We have mark-to-market valuation adjustments for certain derivative transactions, based on foreign currency fluctuations. For more information on our mark-to-market derivatives, see Note\u00a017 \u201cDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\u201d and Note\u00a023 \u201cOther Income (Expense), Net\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements and in Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. These could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.\nFurthermore, we have incurred and may continue to incur severance expenses and restructuring charges in connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition Restructuring Plan, which may, now that the Micro Focus Acquisition has closed, adversely affect our operating results in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.\nFor more information on our transaction costs, see Note\u00a018 \u201cSpecial Charges (Recoveries)\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n31\nTable of Contents\nLoss of key personnel could impair the integration of acquired businesses, lead to loss of customers and a decline in revenues, or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our operations\nOur success as a combined business with any prior or future acquired businesses will depend, in part, upon our ability to retain key employees, especially during the integration phase of the businesses. It is possible that the integration process could result in current and prospective employees of ours and the acquired business to experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to retain or recruit key managers and other employees. If, despite our retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart, the loss of their services and their experience and knowledge regarding our business or an acquired business could have an adverse effect on our future operating results and the successful ongoing operation of our businesses.\nBusinesses we acquire may have disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, cybersecurity and compliance with data privacy laws that are weaker than or otherwise not in conformity with ours\nWe have a history of acquiring complementary businesses of varying size and organizational complexity and we may continue to engage in such acquisitions. Upon consummating an acquisition, we seek to implement our disclosure controls and procedures, our internal controls over financial reporting as well as procedures relating to cybersecurity and compliance with data privacy laws and regulations at the acquired company as promptly as possible. Depending upon the nature and scale of the business acquired, the implementation of our disclosure controls and procedures as well as the implementation of our internal controls over financial reporting at an acquired company may be a lengthy process and may divert our attention from other business operations. Our integration efforts may periodically expose deficiencies in the disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting as well as procedures relating to cybersecurity and compliance with data privacy laws and regulations of an acquired company that were not identified in our due diligence undertaken prior to consummating the acquisition; contractual protections intended to protect against any such deficiencies may not fully eliminate all related risks. If such deficiencies exist, we may not be in a position to comply with our periodic reporting requirements and, as a result, our business and financial condition may be materially harmed. Refer to Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for details on our internal controls over financial reporting for recent acquisitions.\nPro forma financial information may not be indicative of our financial condition or results following the Micro Focus Acquisition\nThe selected pro forma financial information with respect to the Micro Focus Acquisition contained in our public disclosure record is presented for illustrative purposes only as of its respective dates and may not be indicative of our current financial condition or results of operations. The selected unaudited pro forma financial information was derived from the respective historical financial statements of the Company and Micro Focus, and certain adjustments and assumptions were made as of such dates to give effect to the Micro Focus Acquisition. The information upon which these adjustments and assumptions were made was preliminary and these kinds of adjustments and assumptions are difficult to make with complete accuracy. Accordingly, the combined business, assets, results of operations and financial condition may differ significantly from those indicated in the unaudited pro forma financial information, and such variations may negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our Common Shares.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulatory Compliance\nOur provision for income taxes and effective income tax rate may vary significantly and may adversely affect our results of operations and cash resources\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future provision for income taxes, income taxes receivable and our effective income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, results of audits by tax authorities, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, changes in estimates of prior years\u2019 items, the impact of transactions we complete, future levels of research and development spending, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, transfer pricing adjustments, changes in the overall mix of income among the different jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in overall levels of income before taxes. For instance, the provision for income taxes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which requires capitalization and amortization of research and development costs starting Fiscal 2023, have materially increased cash taxes. Furthermore, new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements, and/or any internal restructuring initiatives we may implement from time to time to streamline our operations, can have a material impact on our effective income tax rate.\nTax examinations are often complex as tax authorities may disagree with the treatment of items reported by us and our transfer pricing methodology based upon our limited risk distributor model, the result of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate \n32\nTable of Contents\noutcome with respect to the taxes we owe may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements, and this difference may materially affect our financial position and financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nThe United Kingdom (UK) tax authorities have challenged certain historic tax filing positions of Micro Focus. Based on Micro Focus\u2019 assessment of the value of the underlying tax benefit under dispute, and as supported by external professional advice, it believed that it had no liability in respect of these matters and therefore no tax charge was recorded in current or previous periods. Although the Company, after closing of the Micro Focus Acquisition, believes that assessment is reasonable, no assurance can be made regarding the ultimate outcome of these matters.\nThe Company is also subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and significant judgment has been applied in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes, including historical Micro Focus matters related to the EU State Aid and UK tax authority challenge in respect of prior periods. The provision for income taxes may be impacted by various internal and external factors that could have favorable or unfavorable effects, including changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, results of audits, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, changes in estimates of prior years\u2019 items, the impact of transactions completed, the structuring of activities undertaken, the application of complex transfer pricing rules, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in overall mix and levels of income before taxes. Further, due to Micro Focus\u2019 complex acquisitive history, we could become subject to additional tax audits in jurisdictions in which we have not historically been subject to examination. As a result, our worldwide provision for income taxes and any ultimate tax liability may differ from the amounts initially recorded and such differences could have an adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. \nFor further details on certain tax matters relating to the Company see Note\u00a014 \u201cGuarantees and Contingencies\u201d and Note\u00a015 \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs part of the ongoing audit of our Canadian tax returns by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), we have received notices of, and are appealing, reassessments for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, and the CRA has audited Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018 and is auditing Fiscal 2019. An adverse outcome of these ongoing audits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations\nAs part of its ongoing audit of our Canadian tax returns, the CRA has disputed our transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany transactions with our international subsidiaries and has issued notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016. Assuming the utilization of available tax attributes (further described below), we estimate our potential aggregate liability, as of June\u00a030, 2023, in connection with the CRA\u2019s reassessments for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, to be limited to penalties, interest and provincial taxes that may be due of approximately $76 million. As of June\u00a030, 2023, we have provisionally paid approximately $33\u00a0million in order to fully preserve our rights to object to the CRA\u2019s audit positions, being the minimum payment required under Canadian legislation while the matter is in dispute. This amount is recorded within \u201cLong-term income taxes recoverable\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June\u00a030, 2023.\nThe notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 would, as drafted, increase our taxable income by approximately $90 million to $100 million for each of those years, as well as impose a 10% penalty on the proposed adjustment to income. Audits by the CRA of our tax returns for fiscal years prior to Fiscal 2012 have been completed with no reassessment of our income tax liability.\nWe strongly disagree with the CRA\u2019s positions and believe the reassessments of Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 (including any penalties) are without merit, and we are continuing to contest these reassessments. On June 30, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the Tax Court of Canada seeking to reverse all such reassessments (including penalties) in full and the customary court process is ongoing.\nEven if we are unsuccessful in challenging the CRA\u2019s reassessments to increase our taxable income for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, we have elective deductions available for those years (including carry-backs from later years) that would offset such increased amounts so that no additional cash tax would be payable, exclusive of any assessed penalties and interest, as described above.\nThe CRA has audited Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018 on a basis that we strongly disagree with and are contesting. The focus of the CRA audit has been the valuation of certain intellectual property and goodwill when one of our subsidiaries continued into Canada from Luxembourg in July 2016. In accordance with applicable rules, these assets were recognized for tax purposes at fair market value as of that time, which value was supported by an expert valuation prepared by an independent leading accounting and advisory firm. CRA\u2019s position for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018 relies in significant part on the application of its positions regarding our transfer pricing methodology that are the basis for its reassessment of our fiscal years 2012 to 2016 described above, and that we believe are without merit. Other aspects of CRA\u2019s position for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018 conflict with the expert valuation prepared by the independent leading accounting and advisory firm that was used to support our original filing position. The CRA issued notices of reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018 on a basis \n33\nTable of Contents\nconsistent with its proposal to reduce the available depreciable basis of these assets in Canada. On April 19, 2022, we filed our notice of objection regarding the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 and on March 15, 2023, we filed our notice of objection regarding the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2018. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, the estimated impact of the proposed adjustment could result in us recording an income tax expense, with no immediate cash payment, to reduce the stated value of our deferred tax assets of up to approximately $470\u00a0million. Any such income tax expense could also have a corresponding cash tax impact that would primarily occur over a period of several future years based upon annual income realization in Canada. We strongly disagree with the CRA\u2019s position for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018 and intend to vigorously defend our original filing position. We are not required to provisionally pay any cash amounts to the CRA as a result of the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018 due to the utilization of available tax attributes; however, to the extent the CRA reassesses subsequent fiscal years on a similar basis, we expect to make certain minimum payments required under Canadian legislation, which may need to be provisionally made starting in Fiscal 2024 while the matter is in dispute. \nWe will continue to vigorously contest the adjustments to our taxable income and any penalty and interest assessments, as well as any reduction to the basis of our depreciable property. We are confident that our original tax filing positions were appropriate. Accordingly, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not recorded any accruals in respect of these reassessments or proposed reassessment in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The CRA is auditing Fiscal 2019, and may reassess Fiscal 2019 on a similar basis as Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018. The CRA is also in preliminary stages of auditing Fiscal 2020.\nFor further details on these and other tax audits to which we are subject, see Note\u00a014 \u201cGuarantees and Contingencies\u201d and Note\u00a015 \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks associated with data privacy issues, including evolving laws and regulations and associated compliance efforts, may adversely impact our business\nOur business depends on the processing of personal data, including data transfer between our affiliated entities, to and from our business partners and customers, and with third-party service providers. The laws and regulations relating to personal data are constantly evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new measures addressing data privacy and processing (including collection, storage, transfer, disposal and use) of personal data. Moreover, the interpretation and application of many existing or recently enacted privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the EU, UK, the U.S. and elsewhere are uncertain and fluid, and it is possible that such laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products and services. Any such new laws or regulations, any changes to existing laws and regulations and any such interpretation or application may affect demand for our products and services, impact our ability to effectively transfer data across borders in support of our business operations or increase the cost of providing our products and services. Additionally, any actual or perceived breach of such laws or regulations may subject us to claims and may lead to administrative, civil or criminal liability, as well as reputational harm to our Company and our employees. We could also be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices, or modify our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn the U.S., various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, transfer, disposal, unauthorized disclosure and security of personal data. For example, data protection laws passed by all states within the U.S. require notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, transfer and security of data. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures, along with federal regulatory authorities, have recently increased their attention to matters concerning personal data, and this has and may continue to result in new legislation which could increase the cost of compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 came into effect on January 1, 2020 and was subsequently amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, which took effect January 1, 2023 (the foregoing, collectively, the CCPA). The CCPA requires companies that process information of California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to access and request deletion of their data and opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new private right of action for data breaches. Violations of the CCPA are enforced by the California Attorney General with sizeable civil penalties, particularly for violations that impact large numbers of consumers. The CCPA also establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing the requirements of the CCPA. Comprehensive privacy laws in Colorado, Connecticut and Virginia also came into effect in 2023. Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and Utah have similarly enacted broad laws relating to privacy, data protection and information security that will come into effect in the next few years, and Delaware and Oregon have passed comprehensive privacy laws that are awaiting enactment, further complicating our privacy compliance obligations through the introduction of increasingly disparate requirements across the various U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition to government regulation, privacy advocacy and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us or our clients.\nSome of our operations are subject to the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the EU GDPR), which took effect from May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation as it forms part of retained EU law in the UK by virtue of the \n34\nTable of Contents\nEuropean Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and as amended by the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/419) (the UK GDPR, and together with the EU GDPR, the GDPR), and the UK Data Protection Act 2018. The GDPR imposes a number of obligations for subject companies, and we will need to continue dedicating financial resources and management time to GDPR compliance. The GDPR enhances the obligations placed on companies that control or process personal data including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal data is to be used, mechanisms for obtaining consent from data subjects, controls for data subjects with respect to their personal data (including by enabling them to exercise rights to erasure and data portability), limitations on retention of personal data and mandatory data breach notifications. Additionally, the GDPR places companies under obligations relating to data transfers and the security of the personal data they process. The GDPR provides that supervisory authorities in the EU and the UK may impose administrative fines for certain infringements of the GDPR of up to EUR 20,000,000 under the EU GDPR (or GBP 17,500,000 under the UK GDPR), or 4% of an undertaking\u2019s total, worldwide, annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Individuals who have suffered damage as a result of a subject company\u2019s non-compliance with the GDPR also have the right to seek compensation from such company. Given the breadth of the GDPR, compliance with its requirements is likely to continue to require significant expenditure of resources on an ongoing basis, and there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken for the purposes of compliance will be successful in preventing violation of the GDPR. Given the potential fines, liabilities and damage to our reputation in the event of an actual or perceived violation of the GDPR, such a violation may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. \nIn addition, the GDPR restricts transfers of personal data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK to third countries deemed to lack adequate privacy protections unless an appropriate safeguard is implemented. In light of the July 2020 decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in \nData Protection Commissioner vs Facebook Ireland Limited and Maximillian Schrems\n (C-311/118) (Schrems II) invalidating the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Irish Data Protection Authority\u2019s May 2023 decision to impose a fine of \u20ac1.2 billion on Meta Platforms, Inc. (Meta) regarding Meta\u2019s transfers of personal data to the U.S., there is potential uncertainty with respect to the legality of certain transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK to so-called \u201cthird countries\u201d outside the EEA, including the U.S. and Canada. In addition to the increased legal risk in the event of any such transfers, additional costs might also need to be incurred in order to implement necessary safeguards to comply with GDPR. While the Court of Justice of the EU upheld the adequacy of the old standard contractual clauses (SCCs), a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. In June 2021, the European Commission issued new SCCs that must be used for relevant new data transfers, and existing SCCs must be migrated to the new SCCs by December 27, 2022. At the same time, the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office released two new agreements governing international data transfers out of the UK that can be used from March 21, 2022: the International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA) and the Data Transfer Addendum (Addendum). All existing contracts and any new contracts signed before September 21, 2022 can continue to use the old SCCs until March 21, 2024, after which the old SCCs must be replaced by either the IDTA or the Addendum in conjunction with the new SCCs. All contracts signed after September 21, 2022 must use either the IDTA or the Addendum in conjunction with the new SCCs. Additionally, on March 25, 2022, the U.S. and European Commission announced that they had agreed in principle to a new \u201cTrans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework\u201d (the TDPF to enable trans-Atlantic data flows and address the concerns raised in the Schrems II decision. To implement the commitments of the U.S. under the TDPF, in October 2022, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for the United States Signals Intelligence Activities (the Executive Order). This subsequently prompted the European Commission to formally launch the process to adopt an adequacy decision based on the Executive Order in December 2022, and the adequacy decision was adopted on July 10, 2023. However, the TDPF is likely to be subject to legal challenges and may be struck down by the EU courts.\nOutside of the U.S., the EU and the UK, many jurisdictions have adopted or are adopting new data privacy laws that may impose further onerous compliance requirements, such as data localization, which prohibits companies from storing and/or processing outside the jurisdiction data relating to resident individuals. The proliferation of such laws within the jurisdictions in which we operate may result in conflicting and contradictory requirements, particularly in relation to evolving technologies such as cloud computing and AI. Any failure to successfully navigate the changing regulatory landscape could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPrivacy-related claims or lawsuits initiated by governmental bodies, customers or other third parties, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly regulatory proceedings, litigation, penalties, fines, or other potential liabilities, or require us to change our business practices, sometimes in expensive ways. Unfavorable publicity regarding our privacy practices could damage our reputation, harm our ability to keep existing customers or attract new customers or otherwise adversely affect our business, assets, revenue and brands.\n35\nTable of Contents\nCertain of our products may be perceived as, or determined by the courts to be, a violation of privacy rights and related laws. Any such perception or determination could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations\nBecause of the nature of certain of our products, including those relating to digital investigations, potential customers and purchasers of our products or the general public may perceive that the use of these products results in violations of individual privacy rights. In addition, certain courts or regulatory authorities could determine that the use of our software solutions or other products is a violation of privacy laws, particularly in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Any such determination or perception by potential customers and purchasers, the general public, government entities or the judicial system could harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nAI and other machine learning technology is being integrated into some of our products, systems or solutions, which could present risks and challenges to our business\nAI and other machine learning technology is being integrated into some of our products, systems or solutions and could be a significant factor in future offerings. While AI can present significant benefits, it can also present risks and challenges to our business. Data sourcing, technology, integration and process issues, program bias into decision-making algorithms, security challenges and the protection of personal privacy could impair the adoption and acceptance of AI. If the output from AI in our products, systems or solutions are deemed to be inaccurate or questionable, or if the use of AI does not operate as anticipated or perform as promised, our business and reputation may be harmed. As the adoption of AI quickens, we expect competition to intensify and additional companies may enter our markets offering similar products, systems or solutions.We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors and our strategy to integrate AI and other machine learning technology into our products, systems or solutions may also not be accepted by our customers or by other businesses in the marketplace.The integration of AI may also expose us to risks regarding intellectual property ownership and license rights, particularly if any copyrighted material is embedded in training models. The use of copyrighted materials in AI and other machine learning technology has not been fully interpreted by federal, state, or international courts and the regulatory framework for AI continues to evolve and remains uncertain. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that would affect the way in which AI and other machine learning technology is used in our products, systems or solutions. Further, the cost to comply with such laws or regulations, including court decisions, could be significant. The risks and challenges associated with integrating AI and other machine learning technology into our products, systems and solutions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our unfunded pension obligations\nThrough our acquisitions, we have assumed certain unfunded pension plan liabilities. We will be required to use the operating cash flow that we generate in the future to meet these obligations. As a result, our future net pension liability and cost may be materially affected by the discount rate used to measure these pension obligations and by the longevity and actuarial profile of the relevant workforce. A change in the discount rate may result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of these pension obligations, and these changes may affect the net periodic pension cost in the year the change is made and in subsequent years. We cannot assure that we will generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy these obligations. Any inability to satisfy these pension obligations may have a material adverse effect on the operational and financial health of our business.\nFor more information on our pension obligations, see Note\u00a012 \u201cPension Plans and Other Post Retirement Benefits\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our financial results\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in U.S. dollars. In general, the functional currency of our subsidiaries is the local currency. For each subsidiary, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the month of the transaction. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, unexpected and dramatic devaluations of currencies in developing, as well as developed, markets could negatively affect our revenues from, and the value of the assets located in, those markets.\nTransactional foreign currency gains (losses) are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income under the line item \u201cOther income (expense) net.\u201d See Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. While we use derivative financial instruments to attempt to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing \n36\nTable of Contents\ncountries, could materially affect our financial results. These risks and their potential impacts may be exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and any policy changes, including those resulting from trade and tariff disputes. See \u201cGeopolitical instability, political unrest, war and other global conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has affected and may continue to affect our business.\u201d\nOur indebtedness could limit our operations and opportunities\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding following closing the Micro Focus Acquisition. As of June\u00a030, 2023, we had $9.1 billion of total indebtedness. This level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincreasing our debt service obligations, making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general purposes and increasing the cost of any such borrowing;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nexpose us to fluctuations in the interest rate environment because the interest rates under our credit facilities are variable; \n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; \n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\npotentially placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to certain of our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; \n\u2022\nincreasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing; and\n\u2022\nrestricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities, including other acquisitions.\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, our credit facilities consisted of a $3.585 billion term loan (Acquisition Term Loan), $1.0 billion term loan facility (Term Loan B) and a $750 million committed revolving credit facility (the Revolver). Borrowings under our credit facilities are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets, which security interests may limit our financial flexibility.\nRepayments made under the Acquisition Term Loan and Term Loan B are equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount in equal quarterly installments for the life of such loans, with the remainder due at maturity. The terms of the Acquisition Term Loan, Term Loan B and Revolver include customary restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that could be in our best interests. These restrictive covenants include certain limitations on our ability to make investments, loans and acquisitions, incur additional debt, incur liens and encumbrances, consolidate, amalgamate or merge with any other person, dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments, including a limit on dividends on equity securities or payments to redeem, repurchase or retire equity securities or other indebtedness, engage in transactions with affiliates, materially alter the business we conduct, and enter into certain restrictive agreements. The Acquisition Term Loan, Term Loan B and Revolver includes a financial covenant relating to a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio, which could restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take specified actions. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants that are included in the Acquisition Term Loan, Term Loan B and Revolver could result in a default under the terms thereof, which could permit the lenders thereunder to declare all or part of any outstanding borrowings to be immediately due and payable.\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, we also have $1.0\u00a0billion in aggregate principal amount of 6.90% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (Senior Secured Notes 2027), $900 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% Senior Notes due 2028 (Senior Notes 2028), $850\u00a0million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% Senior Notes due 2029 (Senior Notes 2029), $900 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.125% Senior Notes due 2030 (Senior Notes 2030) and $650\u00a0million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.125% senior unsecured notes due 2031 (Senior Notes 2031 and, together with the Senior Secured Notes due 2027, Senior Notes 2028, Senior Notes 2029 and Senior Notes 2030, the Senior Notes) outstanding, respectively issued in private placements to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain persons in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants that are included in the indentures governing the Senior Notes could result in a default under the terms thereof, which could result in all or a portion of the Senior Notes to be immediately due and payable.\nThe risks discussed above would be increased to the extent that we engage in additional acquisitions that involve the incurrence of material additional debt, or the acquisition of businesses with material debt, and such incurrences or acquisitions \n37\nTable of Contents\ncould potentially negatively impact the ratings or outlook of the rating agencies on our outstanding debt securities and the market price of our common shares.\nFor more information on our indebtedness, see Note\u00a011 \u201cLong-Term Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate, which could materially impact the market price of our Common Shares\nWe experience significant fluctuations in revenues and operating results caused by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nChanges in the demand for our software products and services and for the products and services of our competitors; \n\u2022\nThe introduction or enhancement of software products and services by us and by our competitors; \n\u2022\nMarket acceptance of our software products, enhancements and/or services; \n\u2022\nDelays in the introduction of software products, enhancements and/or services by us or by our competitors; \n\u2022\nCustomer order deferrals in anticipation of upgrades and new software products; \n\u2022\nChanges in the lengths of sales cycles; \n\u2022\nChanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; \n\u2022\nDelays in software product implementation with customers; \n\u2022\nChange in the mix of distribution channels through which our software products are licensed; \n\u2022\nChange in the mix of software products and services sold; \n\u2022\nChange in the mix of international and North American revenues; \n\u2022\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates and applicable interest rates; \n\u2022\nFluctuations in the value of our investments related to certain investment funds in which we are a limited partner:\n\u2022\nAcquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses; \n\u2022\nRestructuring charges taken in connection with any completed acquisition or otherwise; \n\u2022\nOutcome and impact of tax audits and other contingencies;\n\u2022\nInvestor perception of our Company;\n\u2022\nChanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts and our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nChanges in laws and regulations affecting our business, including data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nChanges in general economic and business conditions, including the impact of any potential recession, or direct and indirect supply chain disruptions and shortages; and \n\u2022\nChanges in general political developments, international trade policies and policies taken to stimulate or to preserve national economies. \nA general weakening of the global economy, a continued weakening of the economy in a particular region, economic or business uncertainty or changes in political developments, trade policies or policies implemented to stimulate or preserve economies could result in the cancellation of or delay in customer purchases. A cancellation or deferral of even a small number of license sales or services or delays in the implementation of our software products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. As a result of the timing of software product and service introductions and the rapid evolution of our business as well as of the markets we serve, we cannot predict whether patterns or trends experienced in the past will continue. For these reasons, you should not rely upon period-to-period comparisons of our financial results to forecast future performance. Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly, and this possible variance could materially reduce the market price of our Common Shares.\nChanges in the market price of our Common Shares and credit ratings of our outstanding debt securities could lead to losses for shareholders and debt holders\nThe market price of our Common Shares and credit ratings of our outstanding debt securities are subject to fluctuations. Such fluctuations in market price or credit ratings may continue in response to: (i) quarterly and annual variations in operating results; (ii) announcements of technological innovations or new products or services that are relevant to our industry; (iii) changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; (iv) changes to the ratings or outlook of our outstanding debt securities by rating agencies; (v) impacts of general economic and market conditions or (vi) other events or factors (including those events or \n38\nTable of Contents\nfactors noted in this Part I, Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d or in Part I, \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d of this Annual Report on 10-K). In addition, financial markets experience significant price and volume fluctuations that particularly affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies in particular due to concerns about increasing interest rates, rising inflation or any potential recession. These fluctuations have often resulted from the failure of such companies to meet market expectations in a particular quarter, and thus such fluctuations may or may not be related to the underlying operating performance of such companies. Broad market fluctuations or any failure of our operating results in a particular quarter to meet market expectations may adversely affect the market price of our Common Shares or the credit ratings of our outstanding debt securities. Additionally, short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions in our Common Shares and technical factors in the public trading market for our Common Shares may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro, industry or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites), the amount and status of short interest in our Common Shares, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our Common Shares and other technical trading factors. Occasionally, periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities may lead to the institution of securities class action litigation against a company. If we are subject to such volatility in our market price, we may be the target of such securities litigation in the future. Such legal action could result in substantial costs to defend our interests and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, each of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nGeneral Risks\nUnexpected events may materially harm our ability to align when we incur expenses with when we recognize revenues\nWe incur operating expenses based upon anticipated revenue trends. Since a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed, a delay in recognizing revenues from transactions related to these expenses (such a delay may be due to the factors described herein or it may be due to other factors) could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could materially reduce operating income. If these expenses are not subsequently matched by revenues, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors\nOur revenues and particularly our new software license revenues are difficult to forecast, and, as a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially. Sales forecasts may be particularly inaccurate or unpredictable given general economic and market factors. We use a \u201cpipeline\u201d system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. By reviewing the status of outstanding sales proposals to our customers and potential customers, we make an estimate as to when a customer will make a purchasing decision involving our software products. These estimates are aggregated periodically to make an estimate of our sales pipeline, which we use as a guide to plan our activities and make internal financial forecasts. Our sales pipeline is only an estimate and may be an unreliable predictor of actual sales activity, both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time. Many factors may affect actual sales activity, such as weakened economic conditions, including as a result of any potential recession, which may cause our customers and potential customers to delay, reduce or cancel information technology-related purchasing decisions, our decision to increase prices in response to rising inflation, and the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms from us. If actual sales activity differs from our pipeline estimate, then we may have planned our activities and budgeted incorrectly, and this may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to immediately predict how their pipelines will convert into sales or revenues following the acquisition and their conversion rate post-acquisition may be quite different from their historical conversion rate.\nOur international operations expose us to business, political and economic risks that could cause our operating results to suffer\nWe have significantly increased, and intend to continue to make efforts to increase, our international operations and anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues. These international operations are subject to certain risks and costs, including the difficulty and expense of administering business and compliance abroad, differences in business practices, compliance with domestic and foreign laws (including without limitation domestic and international import and export laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including potential violations by acts of agents or other intermediaries), costs related to localizing products for foreign markets, costs related to translating and distributing software products in a timely manner, costs related to increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities, longer sales and collection cycles for accounts receivables, failure of laws or courts to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, local competition, and economic or political instability and uncertainties, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or geopolitical conflicts. International operations also tend to be subject to a longer sales and collection cycle. In addition, regulatory limitations regarding the repatriation of earnings may adversely affect the transfer of cash earned from international operations. Significant international sales may also expose us to \n39\nTable of Contents\ngreater risk from political and economic instability, unexpected changes in Canadian, U.S. or other governmental policies concerning import and export of goods and technology, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers. Additionally, international earnings may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction, which may materially adversely affect our effective tax rate. Also, international expansion may be difficult, time consuming and costly. These risks and their potential impacts may be exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. See \u201cGeopolitical instability, political unrest, war and other global conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has affected and may continue to affect our business\u201d As a result, if revenues from international operations do not offset the expenses of establishing and maintaining international operations, our business, operating results and financial condition will suffer.\nWe may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may become involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, product liability, employment, class action and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nThe declaration, payment and amount of dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors\nWe have adopted a policy to declare non-cumulative quarterly dividends on our Common Shares. The declaration, payment and amount of any dividends will be made pursuant to our dividend policy and is subject to final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors in its discretion based on a number of factors that it deems relevant, including our financial position, results of operations, available cash resources, cash requirements and alternative uses of cash that our Board of Directors may conclude would be in the best interest of our shareholders. Our dividend payments are subject to relevant contractual limitations, including those in our existing credit agreements and to solvency conditions established by the Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA), the statute under which we are incorporated. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any future dividends will be equal or similar in amount to any dividends previously paid or that our Board of Directors will not decide to reduce, suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time in the future.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by any weakening of economic conditions\nOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. Certain economies have experienced periods of downturn as a result of a multitude of factors, including, but not limited to, turmoil in the credit and financial markets, concerns regarding the stability and viability of major financial institutions, declines in gross domestic product, increases in unemployment, volatility in commodity prices and worldwide stock markets, excessive government debt, disruptions to global trade or tariffs, inflation, higher interest rates and risks of recession and global health pandemics. The severity and length of time that a downturn in economic and financial market conditions may persist, as well as the timing, strength and sustainability of any recovery from such downturn, are unknown and are beyond our control. Recently, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the inflationary environment and policy changes resulting from trade and tariff disputes have raised additional concerns regarding economic uncertainties. Moreover, any instability in the global economy affects countries in different ways, at different times and with varying severity, which makes the impact to our business complex and unpredictable. During such downturns, many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases. Contract negotiations may become more protracted, or conditions could result in reductions in the licensing of our software products and the sale of cloud and other services, longer sales cycles, pressure on our margins, difficulties in collection of accounts receivable or delayed payments, increased default risks associated with our accounts receivables, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. In addition, deterioration of the global credit markets could adversely impact our ability to complete licensing transactions and services transactions, including maintenance and support renewals. Any of these events, as well as a general weakening of, or declining corporate confidence in, the global economy, or a curtailment in government or corporate spending, could delay or decrease our revenues and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nStress in the global financial system may adversely affect our finances and operations in ways that may be hard to predict or to defend against\nFinancial developments seemingly unrelated to us or to our industry may adversely affect us over the course of time. For example, material increases in applicable interest rate benchmarks may increase the interest expense for our credit facilities such as the Acquisition Term Loan, Term Loan B and Revolver that have variable rates of interest. Credit contraction in financial markets may hurt our ability to access credit in the event that we identify an acquisition opportunity or require significant access to credit for other reasons. Similarly, volatility in the market price of our Common Shares due to seemingly unrelated financial developments, such as a recession, inflation or an economic slowdown in the U.S. or internationally, could \n40\nTable of Contents\nhurt our ability to raise capital for the financing of acquisitions or other reasons. Potential price inflation caused by an excess of liquidity in countries where we conduct business may increase the cost we incur to provide our solutions and may reduce profit margins on agreements that govern the licensing of our software products and/or the sale of our services to customers over a multi-year period. A reduction in credit, combined with reduced economic activity, may adversely affect businesses and industries that collectively constitute a significant portion of our customer base such as the public sector. As a result, these customers may need to reduce their licensing of our software products or their purchases of our services, or we may experience greater difficulty in receiving payment for the licenses and services that these customers purchase from us. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which may cause additional economic fluctuation. Any of these events, or any other events caused by turmoil in world financial markets, may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.",

Our solutions range from connecting large digital supply chains to managing HR processes to driving better IT service management in manufacturing, retail and financial services. \nOur solutions also enable organizations and consumers to secure their information so that they can collaborate with confidence, stay ahead of the regulatory technology curve, identify threats on any endpoint or across their networks, enable privacy, leverage eDiscovery and digital forensics to defensibly investigate and collect evidence, and ensure business continuity in the event of a security incident.\nOur initial public offering was on the NASDAQ in 1996 and we were subsequently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) in 1998. Our ticker symbol on both the NASDAQ and the TSX is \u201cOTEX.\u201d\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, we employed a total of approximately 24,100 individuals, of which approximately 9,700 joined our workforce as part of the Micro Focus Acquisition. Of the total 24,100 individuals we employed as of June\u00a030, 2023, 9,050 or 38% are in the Americas, 5,750 or 24% are in EMEA and 9,300 or 38% are in Asia Pacific. Currently, we have employees in 45 countries enabling strong access to multiple talent pools while ensuring reach and proximity to our customers. Please see \u201cResults of Operations\u201d below for our definitions of geographic regions.\nPeriod-over-period comparisons presented here are significantly impacted by our Micro Focus Acquisition.\nFiscal 2023 Summary:\n\u2022\nTotal revenue was $4,485.0 million, up 28.4% compared to the prior fiscal year; up 32.2% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $132.4 million of foreign exchange rate changes. The Micro Focus Acquisition contributed  $976.5 million of revenues. \n\u2022\nTotal annual recurring revenue, which we define as the sum of cloud services and subscriptions revenue and customer support revenue, was $3,615.5 million, up 26.2% compared to the prior fiscal year; up 29.7% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $102.4 million of foreign exchange rate changes. \n\u2022\nCloud services and subscriptions revenue was $1,700.4 million, up 10.8% compared to the prior fiscal year; up 13.3% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $38.6 million of foreign exchange rate changes. \n\u2022\nGAAP-based gross margin was 70.6% compared to 69.6% in the prior fiscal year.\n\u2022\nNon-GAAP-based gross margin was 76.1% compared to 75.6% in the prior fiscal year.\n\u2022\nGAAP-based net income attributable to OpenText was $150.4 million compared to $397.1 million in the prior fiscal year. The Micro Focus Acquisition contributed $94.7 million of GAAP-based net losses.\n\u2022\nNon-GAAP-based net income attributable to OpenText was $890.7 million compared to $876.2 million in the prior fiscal year.\n\u2022\nGAAP-based earnings per share (EPS), diluted, was $0.56 compared to $1.46 in the prior fiscal year.\n\u2022\nNon-GAAP-based EPS, diluted, was $3.29 compared to $3.22 in the prior fiscal year.\n\u2022\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $1,472.9 million compared to $1,265.0 million in the prior fiscal year.\n50\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nOperating cash flow was $779.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to $981.8 million in the prior fiscal year, down 20.6%.\n\u2022\nCash and cash equivalents were $1,231.6 million as of June\u00a030, 2023, compared to $1,693.7 million as of June\u00a030, 2022. \n\u2022\nAcquired Micro Focus for total consideration of $6.2 billion, inclusive of Micro Focus\u2019 cash, subject to final adjustments. \n\u2022\nIn connection with the financing of the Micro Focus Acquisition, we drew down the entire $3.585 billion of the Acquisition Term Loan (as defined below), issued $1\u00a0billion of Senior Secured Notes 2027 (as defined below) and drew down $450 million under the Revolver (as defined below). Subsequent to the closing of the Micro Focus Acquisition we repaid $175 million of the outstanding balance on the Revolver during the year ended June 30, 2023 and subsequently repaid $175 million on July 5, 2023.\n\u2022\nEnterprise cloud bookings were $527.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to $482.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. We define Enterprise cloud bookings as the total value from cloud services and subscription contracts entered into in the fiscal year that are new, committed and incremental to our existing contracts, entered into with our enterprise-based customers.\nSee \u201cUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for definitions and reconciliations of GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures. See \u201cAcquisitions\u201d below for the impact of acquisitions on the period-to-period comparability of results.\nAcquisitions\nAs a result of the continually changing marketplace in which we operate, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities within our market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities. \nAcquisition of Micro Focus\nOn January 31, 2023, we acquired all of the issued and to be issued share capital of Micro Focus for a total purchase price of $6.2 billion, inclusive of Micro Focus\u2019 cash and repayment of Micro Focus\u2019 outstanding indebtedness, subject to final adjustments. \nIn connection with the financing of the Micro Focus Acquisition, concurrent with the announcement of the acquisition on August 25, 2022, the Company entered into the Acquisition Term Loan and Bridge Loan (as defined below) as well as certain derivative transactions. On December 1, 2022, the Company issued and sold $1\u00a0billion in aggregate principal amount of 6.90% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (Senior Secured Notes 2027), amended the Acquisition Term Loan and terminated the Bridge Loan. On January 31, 2023, we drew down the entire aggregate principal amount of $3.585 billion of the Acquisition Term Loan, net of original issuance discount and other fees, and drew down $450 million under the Revolver. We used these proceeds and cash on hand to fund the purchase price consideration and repayment of Micro Focus\u2019 outstanding indebtedness. In conjunction with the closing of the Micro Focus Acquisition, the deal-contingent forward contracts and non-contingent forward contract, as described in Note\u00a017 \u201cDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements were settled. See Note\u00a019 \u201cAcquisitions\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. The Micro Focus Acquisition has contributed to the growth in our revenues and significantly impacts period-over-period comparability.\nImpacts of Russia-Ukraine Conflict\nWe have ceased all direct business in Russia and Belarus and with known Russian-owned companies. To support certain of our cloud customers headquartered in the United States or allied countries that rely on our network to manage their global business (including their business in Russia), we have nonetheless allowed these customers to continue to use our services to the extent that it can be done in strict compliance with all applicable sanctions and export controls. However, we may adjust our business practices as required by applicable rules and regulations. While we do not expect our decision to cease all direct business in Russia and Belarus and with known Russian-owned companies to have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition, it is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict, including adverse effects on the global economy, on our business and operations as well as those of our customers, partners and third party service providers. For more information, please see Part I, Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOutlook for Fiscal 2024\nAs an organization, we are committed to \u201cTotal Growth\u201d, meaning we strive towards delivering value through organic initiatives, innovations and acquisitions. With an emphasis on increasing recurring revenues and expanding profitability, we \n51\nTable of Contents\nbelieve our Total Growth strategy will ultimately drive cash flow growth, thus helping to fuel our innovation, broaden our go-to-market distribution and identify and execute strategic acquisitions. With strategic acquisitions, we are well positioned to expand our product portfolio and improve our ability to innovate and grow organically, which helps us to meet our long-term growth targets. Our Total Growth strategy is a durable model, that we believe will create both near and long-term shareholder value through organic and acquired growth, capital efficiency and profitability.\nWe are committed to continuous innovation. Our investments in research and development (R&D) push product innovation, increasing the value of our offerings to our existing customer base and new customers, which includes Global 10,000 companies (G10K), SMBs and consumers. The G10K are the world\u2019s largest companies, ranked by estimated total revenues, as well as the world's largest governments and global organizations. More valuable products, coupled with our established global partner program, lead to greater distribution and cross-selling opportunities which further help us to achieve organic growth. Over the last three fiscal years, we have invested a cumulative total of $1.54\u00a0billion in R&D or 13.6% of cumulative revenue for that three-year period. On an annual basis, we continue to target to spend 14% to 16% of revenues on R&D expense. With our innovation roadmap delivered, we believe we have fortified our support for customer choice: private cloud, public cloud, off-cloud, and API cloud.\nLooking ahead, the destination for innovation is cloud. Businesses of all sizes rely on a combination of public and private clouds, managed services and off-cloud solutions. As a result, we are committed to continue to modernize our technology infrastructure and leverage our existing investments in the OpenText Cloud and programs to help customers off-cloud. The combination of OpenText cloud-native applications and managed services, together with the scalability and performance of our partner public cloud providers, offer more secure, reliable and compliant solutions to customers wanting to deploy cloud-based Information Management applications. The OpenText Cloud is designed to build additional flexibility and scalability for our customers: becoming cloud-native, connecting anything, and extending capabilities with multi-tenant SaaS applications and services.\nThe completion of the Micro Focus Acquisition during Fiscal 2023 has substantially expanded our scope and size by adding substantial assets and operations to our existing business. During Fiscal 2023, we incurred significant transaction costs in connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional integration costs. As part of the Micro Focus Acquisition, the Company made a strategic decision to implement a restructuring plan that impacted its global workforce and further reduce its real estate footprint around the world in an effort to further streamline our operations, consistent with previously announced cost synergies of $400\u00a0million (Micro Focus Acquisition Restructuring Plan). The total size of the plan is expected to result in a reduction in the combined workforce of approximately 8%, or 2,000 employees, with an estimated cost of $135.0\u00a0million to $150.0\u00a0million, of which we incurred $72.3 million during Fiscal 2023. We expect the Micro Focus Acquisition Restructuring Plan to be completed by the end of Fiscal 2024. See also Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Micro Focus Acquisition has a significant impact on period-over-period comparability as more fully discussed below.\nWe will continue to closely monitor the potential impacts of inflation with respect to wages, services and goods, concerns regarding any potential recession, rising interest rates, financial market volatility, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business. See Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at that time. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. The policies listed below are areas that may contain key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Some of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a higher degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our financial statements. The critical accounting policies which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\n(i)\nRevenue recognition, \n(ii)\nGoodwill, \n(iii)\nAcquired intangibles and\n(iv)\nIncome taxes.\nFor a full discussion of all our accounting policies, please see Note\u00a02 \u201cAccounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n52\nTable of Contents\nRevenue recognition\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606 \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (Topic 606), we account for a customer contract when we obtain written approval, the contract is committed, the rights of the parties, including the payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection. Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of a promised product or service is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for our products and services (at its transaction price). Estimates of variable consideration and the determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on readily available information, which may include historical, current and forecasted information, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and specific facts and circumstances of each arrangement. We report revenue net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing transactions.\nWe have four revenue streams: cloud services and subscriptions, customer support, license and professional service and other.\nCloud services and subscriptions revenue\nCloud services and subscriptions revenue are from hosting arrangements where, in connection with the licensing of software, the end user does not take possession of the software, as well as from end-to-end fully outsourced business-to-business (B2B) integration solutions to our customers (collectively referred to as cloud arrangements). The software application resides on our hardware or that of a third party, and the customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis. Our cloud arrangements can be broadly categorized as \u201cplatform as a service\u201d (PaaS), \u201csoftware as a service\u201d (SaaS), cloud subscriptions and managed services.\nPaaS/ SaaS/ Cloud Subscriptions (collectively referred to here as cloud-based solutions):\n We offer cloud-based solutions that provide customers the right to access our software through the internet. Our cloud-based solutions represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. These services are made available to the customer continuously throughout the contractual period. However, the extent to which the customer uses the services may vary at the customer\u2019s discretion. The payment for cloud-based solutions may be received either at inception of the arrangement, or over the term of the arrangement.\nThese cloud-based solutions are considered to have a single performance obligation where the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit, and as such we recognize revenue for these cloud-based solutions ratably over the term of the contractual agreement. For example, revenue related to cloud-based solutions that are provided on a usage basis, such as the number of users, is recognized based on a customer\u2019s utilization of the services in a given period.\nAdditionally, a software license is present in a cloud-based solutions arrangement if all of the following criteria are met:\n(i)\nThe customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time without significant penalty; and\n(ii)\nIt is feasible for the customer to host the software independent of us.\nIn these cases where a software license is present in a cloud-based solutions arrangement it is assessed to determine if it is distinct from the cloud-based solutions arrangement. The revenue allocated to the distinct software license would be recognized at the point in time the software license is transferred to the customer, whereas the revenue allocated to the hosting performance obligation would be recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the contractual term unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned, or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern over the contractual term of the arrangement.\nManaged services:\n We provide comprehensive B2B process outsourcing services for all day-to-day operations of a customers\u2019 B2B integration program. Customers using these managed services are not permitted to take possession of our software and the contract is for a defined period, where customers pay a monthly or quarterly fee. Our performance obligation is satisfied as we provide services of operating and managing a customer\u2019s electronic data interchange (EDI) environment. Revenue relating to these services is recognized using an output method based on the expected level of service we will provide over the term of the contract.\nIn connection with cloud subscription and managed service contracts, we often agree to perform a variety of services before the customer goes live, such as, converting and migrating customer data, building interfaces and providing training. These services are considered an outsourced suite of professional services which can involve certain project-based activities. These services can be provided at the initiation of a contract, during the implementation or on an ongoing basis as part of the customer life cycle. These services can be charged separately on a fixed fee, a time and materials basis, or the costs associated may be recovered as part of the ongoing cloud subscription or managed services fee. These outsourced professional services are considered distinct from the ongoing hosting services and represent a separate performance obligation within our cloud subscription or managed services arrangements. The obligation to provide outsourced professional services is satisfied over \n53\nTable of Contents\ntime, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligations. For outsourced professional services, we recognize revenue by measuring progress toward the satisfaction of our performance obligation. Progress for services that are contracted for a fixed price is generally measured based on hours incurred as a portion of total estimated hours. As a practical expedient, when we invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date, we recognize revenue at that amount.\nCustomer support revenue\nCustomer support revenue is associated with perpetual, term license and off-cloud subscription arrangements. As customer support is not critical to the customers\u2019 ability to derive benefit from their right to use our software, customer support is considered a distinct performance obligation when sold together in a bundled arrangement along with the software.\n Customer support consists primarily of technical support and the provision of unspecified updates and upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. Customer support for perpetual licenses is renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Customer support for term and subscription licenses is renewable concurrently with such licenses for the same duration of time. Payments for customer support are generally made at the inception of the contract term or in installments over the term of the maintenance period. Our customer support team is ready to provide these maintenance services, as needed, to the customer during the contract term. As the elements of customer support are delivered concurrently and have the same pattern of transfer, customer support is accounted for as a single performance obligation. The customer benefits evenly throughout the contract period from the guarantee that the customer support resources and personnel will be available to them, and that any unspecified upgrades or unspecified future products developed by us will be made available. Revenue for customer support is recognized ratably over the contract period based on the start and end dates of the maintenance term, in line with how we believe services are provided.\nLicense revenue\nOur license revenue can be broadly categorized as perpetual licenses, term licenses and subscription licenses, all of which are deployed on the customer\u2019s premises (off-cloud).\nPerpetual licenses\n: We sell perpetual licenses which provide customers the right to use software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. Our perpetual licenses provide a right to use intellectual property (IP) that is functional in nature and have significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for perpetual licenses of functional IP, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when control has been transferred to the customer, which normally occurs once software activation keys have been made available for download.\nTerm licenses and Subscription licenses:\n We sell both term and subscription licenses which provide customers the right to use software for a specified period in exchange for a fee, which may be paid at contract inception or paid in installments over the period of the contract. Like perpetual licenses, both our term licenses and subscription licenses are functional IP that have significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for both term and subscription licenses, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when the customer is able to use and benefit from the software, which is normally once software activation keys have been made available for download at the commencement of the term.\nProfessional service and other revenue\nOur professional services, when offered along with software licenses, consist primarily of technical and training services. Technical services may include installation, customization, implementation or consulting services. Training services may include access to online modules, or the delivery of a training package customized to the customer\u2019s needs. At the customer\u2019s discretion, we may offer one, all, or a mix of these services. Payment for professional services is generally a fixed fee or a fee based on time and materials. Professional services can be arranged in the same contract as the software license or in a separate contract.\nAs our professional services do not significantly change the functionality of the license and our customers can benefit from our professional services on their own or together with other readily available resources, we consider professional services distinct within the context of the contract.\nProfessional service revenue is recognized over time as long as: (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as we perform them, (ii) our performance creates or enhances an asset the customer controls as we perform and (iii) our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use, and we have the enforceable right to payment.\nIf all the above criteria are met, we use an input-based measure of progress for recognizing professional service revenue. For example, we may consider total labour hours incurred compared to total expected labour hours. As a practical expedient, when we invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date, we will recognize revenue at that amount.\n54\nTable of Contents\nMaterial rights\nTo the extent that we grant our customer an option to acquire additional products or services in one of our arrangements, we will account for the option as a distinct performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to the customer that the customer would not receive without entering into the contract. For example, if we give the customer an option to acquire additional goods or services in the future at a price that is significantly lower than the current price, this would be a material right as it allows the customer to, in effect, pay in advance for the option to purchase future products or services. If a material right exists in one of our contracts, then revenue allocated to the option is deferred and we would recognize that deferred revenue only when those future products or services are transferred or when the option expires.\nBased on history, our contracts do not typically contain material rights and when they do, the material right is not significant to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nArrangements with multiple performance obligations\nOur contracts generally contain more than one of the products and services listed above. Determining whether goods and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as a single performance obligation may require judgment, specifically when assessing whether both of the following two criteria are met:\n\u2022\nthe customer can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer; and\n\u2022\nour promise to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\nIf these criteria are not met, we determine an appropriate measure of progress based on the nature of our overall promise for the single performance obligation.\nIf these criteria are met, each product or service is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation and the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis.\nStandalone selling price\nThe SSP reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In most cases we are able to establish the SSP based on observable data. We typically establish a narrow SSP range for our products and services and assess this range on a periodic basis or when material changes in facts and circumstances warrant a review.\nIf the SSP is not directly observable, then we estimate the amount using either the expected cost plus a margin or residual approach. Estimating SSP requires judgment that could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized. SSP is a formal process whereby management considers multiple factors including, but not limited to, geographic or region-specific factors, competitive positioning, internal costs, profit objectives and pricing practices.\nTransaction Price Allocation\nIn bundled arrangements, where we have more than one distinct performance obligation, we must allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative SSP. However, in certain bundled arrangements, the SSP may not always be directly observable. For instance, in bundled arrangements with license and customer support, we allocate the transaction price between the license and customer support performance obligations using the residual approach because we have determined that the SSP for licenses in these arrangements are highly variable. We use the residual approach only for our license arrangements. When the SSP is observable but contractual pricing does not fall within our established SSP range, then an adjustment is required, and we will allocate the transaction price between license and customer support based on the relative SSP established for the respective performance obligations.\nWhen two or more contracts are entered into at or near the same time with the same customer, we evaluate the facts and circumstances associated with the negotiation of those contracts. Where the contracts are negotiated as a package, we will account for them as a single arrangement and allocate the consideration for the combined contracts among the performance obligations accordingly.\nWe believe there are significant assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition as discussed above and these assumptions, judgments and estimates could impact the timing of when revenue is recognized and could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n55\nTable of Contents\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment (at a minimum annually) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable.\nOur operations are analyzed by management and our chief operating decision maker (CODM) as being part of a single industry segment: the design, development, marketing and sales of Information Management software and solutions. Therefore, our goodwill impairment assessment is based on the allocation of goodwill to a single reporting unit.\nWe perform a qualitative assessment to test our reporting unit\u2019s goodwill for impairment. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of our reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the quantitative assessment of the impairment test is performed. In the quantitative assessment, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired, and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference, but not exceeding the total carrying value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, would be recorded.\nOur annual impairment analysis of goodwill was performed as of April 1, 2023. Our qualitative assessment indicated that there were no indications of impairment and therefore there was no impairment of goodwill required to be recorded for Fiscal 2023 (no impairments were recorded for Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively).\nAcquired intangibles\nIn accordance with business combinations accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations may require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets typically consist of acquired technology and customer relationships.\nIn valuing our acquired intangible assets, we may make assumptions and estimates based in part on information obtained from the management of the acquired company, which may make our assumptions and estimates inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates we may make in valuing certain of the intangible assets that we acquire include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nfuture expected cash flows of our individual revenue streams;\n\u2022\nhistorical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;\n\u2022\nthe expected use of the acquired assets; and\n\u2022\ndiscount rates.\nAs a result of the judgments that need to be made, we obtain the assistance of independent valuation firms. We complete these assessments as soon as practical after the closing dates. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates of fair value we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill, if the changes are related to conditions that existed at the time of the acquisition. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments, based on events that occurred subsequent to the acquisition date, are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d (Topic 740).\nWe account for our uncertain tax provisions by using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained on audit, including the resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize. The amount of benefit to recognize is measured as the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be realized. The tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit. On subsequent recognition and measurement, the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be recognized at each reporting date will represent the Company\u2019s best \n56\nTable of Contents\nestimate, given the information available at the reporting date, although the outcome of the tax position is not absolute or final. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to liabilities for income taxes within the \u201cProvision for (recovery of) income taxes\u201d line of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. These temporary differences are measured using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that we consider it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining the valuation allowance, we consider factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected taxable income and the character of income tax assets and tax planning strategies. A change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense.\nThe Company\u2019s tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities across multiple global subsidiaries and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Since tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of the Company\u2019s tax positions will be sustained upon audit. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes considers current tax laws, our interpretations of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities. While we believe the assumptions and estimates that we have made are reasonable, such assumptions and estimates could have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements upon ultimate resolution of the tax positions.\nFor additional details, please see Note\u00a015 \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables provide a detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. For each of the periods indicated below, we present our revenues by product type, revenues by major geography, cost of revenues by product type, total gross margin, total operating margin, gross margin by product type and their corresponding percentage of total revenue. \nIn addition, we provide Non-GAAP measures for the periods discussed in order to provide additional information to investors that we believe will be useful as this presentation is in line with how our management assesses our Company\u2019s performance. See \u201cUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation of GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures.\nThe comparability of our operating results for the year ended June\u00a030, 2023 as compared to the year ended June\u00a030, 2022 was impacted by the recent Micro Focus Acquisition. Our total revenues increased by $991.1 million across all of our product types in the year ended June\u00a030, 2023, relative to the year ended June\u00a030, 2022, primarily due to revenue contributions from the Micro Focus Acquisition, offset by unfavorable impact of $132.4 million of foreign exchange rate changes. The Micro Focus Acquisition contributed $976.5 million to our total revenues during the year ended June\u00a030, 2023, of which $629.1 million related to customer support revenues and $219.6 million related to license revenues.\nTotal cost of revenues increased by $254.4 million in the year ended June\u00a030, 2023, relative to the year ended June\u00a030, 2022, primarily from additional cost of revenues of $279.3 million as a result of the Micro Focus Acquisition.\nTotal operating expenses increased by $865.2 million in the year ended June\u00a030, 2023, relative to the year ended June\u00a030, 2022, primarily from additional operating expenses of $761.5 million as a result of the Micro Focus Acquisition, of which $550.4 million was related to research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses.\n57\nTable of Contents\nSummary of Results of Operations\nYear Ended June 30,\n(In thousands)\n2023\nChange \nincrease (decrease)\n2022\nChange

user does not take possession of the software, as well as from end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solutions to our customers (collectively referred to as cloud arrangements). The software application resides on our hardware or that of a third party, and the customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis via an identified line. Our cloud arrangements can be broadly categorized as PaaS, SaaS, cloud subscriptions and managed services. For the year ended June\u00a030, 2023, our cloud renewal rate, excluding the impact of Carbonite, Zix and Micro Focus was approximately 94%, consistent with the year ended June\u00a030, 2022.\nCost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues is comprised primarily of third-party network usage fees, maintenance of in-house data hardware centers, technical support personnel-related costs and some third party royalty costs.\nYear Ended June 30,\n(In thousands)\n2023\nChange \nincrease (decrease)\n2022\nChange \nincrease (decrease)\n2021\nCloud Services and Subscriptions:\nAmericas\n$\n1,287,731\u00a0\n$\n131,813\u00a0\n$\n1,155,918\u00a0\n$\n107,474\u00a0\n$\n1,048,444\u00a0\nEMEA\n305,293\u00a0\n30,469\u00a0\n274,824\u00a0\n18,625\u00a0\n256,199\u00a0\nAsia Pacific\n107,409\u00a0\n3,134\u00a0\n104,275\u00a0\n1,473\u00a0\n102,802\u00a0\nTotal Cloud Services and Subscriptions Revenues\n1,700,433\u00a0\n165,416\u00a0\n1,535,017\u00a0\n127,572\u00a0\n1,407,445\u00a0\nCost of Cloud Services and Subscriptions Revenues\n590,165\u00a0\n78,452\u00a0\n511,713\u00a0\n29,895\u00a0\n481,818\u00a0\nGAAP-based Cloud Services and Subscriptions Gross Profit\n$\n1,110,268\u00a0\n$\n86,964\u00a0\n$\n1,023,304\u00a0\n$\n97,677\u00a0\n$\n925,627\u00a0\nGAAP-based Cloud Services and Subscriptions Gross Margin %\n65.3\u00a0\n%\n66.7\u00a0\n%\n65.8\u00a0\n%\n% Cloud Services and Subscriptions Revenues by Geography:\nAmericas\n75.7\u00a0\n%\n75.3\u00a0\n%\n74.5\u00a0\n%\nEMEA\n18.0\u00a0\n%\n17.9\u00a0\n%\n18.2\u00a0\n%\nAsia Pacific\n6.3\u00a0\n%\n6.8\u00a0\n%\n7.3\u00a0\n%\nCloud services and subscriptions revenues increased by $165.4 million or 10.8% during the year ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the prior fiscal year; up 13.3% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $38.6 million of foreign exchange rate changes. The increase was primarily driven by organic revenue growth, as well as partially driven by incremental revenues from the Micro Focus Acquisition over the comparative period.

These agreements allow our customers to receive technical support, enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when available. Customer support revenues are generated from support and maintenance relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods. Therefore, changes in Customer support revenues do not always correlate directly to the changes in license revenues from period to period. The terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months, and are renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Our management reviews our Customer support renewal rates on a quarterly basis, and we use these rates as a method of monitoring our customer service performance. For the year ended June\u00a030, 2023, our Customer support renewal rate was approximately 95%, compared to approximately 94% for the year ended June\u00a030, 2022, excluding the impact of Carbonite, Zix and Micro Focus.\n59\nTable of Contents\nCost of Customer support revenues is comprised primarily of technical support personnel and related costs, as well as third party royalty costs.\nYear Ended June 30,\n(In thousands)\n2023\nChange \nincrease (decrease)\n2022\nChange \nincrease (decrease)\n2021\nCustomer Support Revenues:\nAmericas\n$\n1,081,192\u00a0\n$\n337,718\u00a0\n$\n743,474\u00a0\n$\n(250)\n$\n743,724\u00a0\nEMEA\n662,601\u00a0\n186,915\u00a0\n475,686\u00a0\n(5,872)\n481,558\u00a0\nAsia Pacific\n171,227\u00a0\n59,422\u00a0\n111,805\u00a0\n3,025\u00a0\n108,780\u00a0\nTotal Customer Support Revenues\n1,915,020\u00a0\n584,055\u00a0\n1,330,965\u00a0\n(3,097)\n1,334,062\u00a0\nCost of Customer Support Revenues\n209,705\u00a0\n88,220\u00a0\n121,485\u00a0\n(1,268)\n122,753\u00a0\nGAAP-based Customer Support Gross Profit\n$\n1,705,315\u00a0\n$\n495,835\u00a0\n$\n1,209,480\u00a0\n$\n(1,829)\n$\n1,211,309\u00a0\nGAAP-based Customer Support Gross Margin %\n89.0\u00a0\n%\n90.9\u00a0\n%\n90.8\u00a0\n%\n% Customer Support Revenues by Geography:\nAmericas\n56.5\u00a0\n%\n55.9\u00a0\n%\n55.7\u00a0\n%\nEMEA\n34.6\u00a0\n%\n35.7\u00a0\n%\n36.1\u00a0\n%\nAsia Pacific\n8.9\u00a0\n%\n8.4\u00a0\n%\n8.2\u00a0\n%\nCustomer support revenues increased by $584.1 million or 43.9% during the year ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the prior fiscal year; up 48.7% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $63.8 million of foreign exchange rate changes.

Tax expense decreased from $118.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 to $70.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate was driven by increases in withholding taxes, changes in valuation allowance, permanent differences related to foreign source income inclusions, and the impact of \n65\nTable of Contents\ninternal reorganizations, partially offset by lower pretax income, tax credits and permanent adjustments related to the preferential tax treatment of the mark-to-market gains on derivatives. The tax rate for the year ended June\u00a030, 2022 varied from the statutory rate due favorable permanent adjustments related to excess share-based compensation deductions, tax credits, and the reduction in the accrual on unremitted foreign earnings, partially offset by the impact of internal reorganizations and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits.\nBeginning July 1, 2022, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTax Act\u201d), our research and development expenditures are now being capitalized and amortized. For fiscal year 2023, the new regulations resulted in incremental cash tax payments of approximately $68 million. The actual impact on future cash flows from operations will primarily depend on if or when this legislation is deferred, modified, or repealed by the U.S. Congress and the amount of R&D expenditures paid or incurred in those respective years. We estimate the largest potential impact will be related to Fiscal 2023 cash flows fro\nm operations and that the impact in future years should gradually decrease over the respective amortization periods. \nThe Inflation Reduction Act and Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act (the Inflation Reduction Act) were signed into law in August 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act introduced new provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax for certain large corporations that have at least an average of $1 billion of adjusted financial statement income over a consecutive three-tax-year period. The corporate minimum tax will be effective for Fiscal 2024. We are currently evaluating the applicability and the effect of the new law to our financial results.\nFor information on certain potential tax contingencies, including the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) matter, see Note\u00a014 \u201cGuarantees and Contingencies\u201d and Note\u00a015 \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

For more details, see \u201cLong-term Debt and Credit Facilities\u201d below. \nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, we have recognized a provision of $28.3 million (June\u00a030, 2022\u2014$15.1 million) in respect of deferred income tax liabilities for temporary differences related to the undistributed earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries and planned periodic repatriations from certain German subsidiaries, that will be subject to withholding taxes upon distribution.\nCash flows provided by operating activities \nCash flows from operating activities decreased by $202.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year due to a decrease in net changes from working capital of $255.8 million, partially offset by an increase in net income after the impact of non-cash items of $53.2 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023 we had a days sales outstanding (DSO) of 41 days, compared to our DSO of 43 days during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022. The per day impact of our DSO in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 on our cash flows was $16.6 million and $10.0 million, respectively. In arriving at DSO, we exclude contract assets as these assets do not provide an unconditional right to the related consideration from the customer.\nCash flows used in investing activities\nOur cash flows used in investing activities is primarily on account of acquisitions and additions of property and equipment. \nCash flows used in investing activities increased by $4.68 billion during the year ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to consideration paid for acquisitions during Fiscal 2023, which includes cash paid for the Micro Focus Acquisition of $5.658 billion, as compared to the cash paid during Fiscal 2022 for the acquisition of Zix of $856.2 million and the acquisition of Bricata Inc. of $17.8 million.\n67\nTable of Contents\nCash flows provided by (used in) financing activities \nOur cash flows from financing activities generally consist of long-term debt financing and amounts received from stock options exercised by our employees and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) purchases by our employees. These inflows are typically offset by scheduled and non-scheduled repayments of our long-term debt financing and, when applicable, the payment of dividends and/or repurchases of our Common Shares. \nCash flows provided by financing activities increased by $4.265 billion during the year ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. This is primarily due to the net impact of the following activities:\n(i)\n$3.427 billion increase in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and draw down on the Revolver;\n(ii)\n$657.1 million decrease in repayments of long-term debt and Revolver;\n(iii)\n$266.7 million related to less cash used in the repurchases of Common Shares and treasury stock; and\n(iv)\n$25.0 million relating to early call termination premium upon redemption of Senior Notes 2026 in Fiscal 2022 that did not occur in Fiscal 2023.\nThe increases in cash flows provided by financing activities above were partially offset by the following decreases:\n(i)\n$60.7 million increase in debt issuance costs;\n(ii)\n$27.9 million related to lower proceeds from the issuance of Common Shares for the exercise of options and the OpenText ESPP; and\n(iii)\n$21.9 million related to higher cash dividends paid to shareholders.\nCash Dividends\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.9720 per Common Share in the aggregate amount of $259.5 million (year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\u2014$0.8836 and $0.7770 per Common Share, respectively, in the aggregate amount of $237.7 million and $210.7 million, respectively).\nFuture declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to final determination and discretion of the Board.

The Senior Secured Notes 2027 and the related guarantees are effectively senior to all of the Company\u2019s and the guarantors\u2019 senior unsecured debt to the extent of the value of the Collateral (as defined in the 2027 Indenture) and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of each of the Company\u2019s existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes 2027.\nThe foregoing description of the 2027 Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2027 Indenture, which is filed as an exhibit to the Company\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 1, 2022.\nFor further details relating to our debt, please see Note\u00a011 \u201cLong-Term Debt\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTerm Loan B\nOn May 30, 2018, we entered into a credit facility, which provides for a $1 billion term loan facility with certain lenders named therein, Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays), as sole administrative agent and collateral agent, and as lead arranger and joint bookrunner (Term Loan B) and borrowed the full amount on May 30, 2018 to, among other things, repay in full the loans under our prior $800 million term loan credit facility originally entered into on January 16, 2014. Repayments made under Term Loan B are equal to 0.25% of the principal amount in equal quarterly installments for the life of Term Loan B, with the remainder due at maturity.\nBorrowings under Term Loan B are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets on a pari passu basis with the Revolver, the Acquisition Term Loan and Senior Secured Notes 2027. Term Loan B has a seven-year term, maturing in \n72\nTable of Contents\nMay 2025. On June 6, 2023, we amended the Term Loan B to replace the LIBOR benchmark rate applicable to borrowings under Term Loan B with a SOFR benchmark rate.\nBorrowings under Term Loan B bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at the borrower\u2019s option, either (1) the SOFR benchmark rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing or (2) an alternate base rate (ABR). The applicable margin for borrowings under Term Loan B is 1.75%, with respect to SOFR advances and 0.75%, with respect to ABR advances. The interest on the current outstanding balance for Term Loan B is equal to 1.75% plus SOFR (subject to a 0.00% floor). As of June\u00a030, 2023, the outstanding balance on the Term Loan B bears an interest rate of 6.90%.\nTerm Loan B has incremental facility capacity of (i) $250 million plus (ii) additional amounts, subject to meeting a \u201cconsolidated senior secured net leverage\u201d ratio not exceeding 2.75:1.00, in each case subject to certain conditions. Consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, that is secured by our or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 assets, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges.\nUnder Term Loan B, we must maintain a \u201cconsolidated net leverage\u201d ratio of no more than 4.00:1.00 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges. As of June\u00a030, 2023, our consolidated net leverage ratio, as calculated in accordance with the applicable agreement, was 3.49:1.00.\nFor further details relating to our debt, please see Note\u00a011 \u201cLong-Term Debt\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevolver\nOn October 31, 2019, we amended our committed revolving credit facility (the Revolver) to increase the total commitments under the Revolver from $450 million to $750 million as well as to extend the maturity from May 5, 2022 to October 31, 2024. Borrowings under the Revolver are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets, on a pari passu basis with Term Loan B, the Acquisition Term Loan and Senior Secured Notes 2027. The Revolver has no fixed repayment date prior to the end of the term. On June 6, 2023, we amended the Revolver to replace the LIBOR benchmark rate applicable to borrowings with a SOFR benchmark rate. Borrowings under the Revolver currently bear interest per annum at a floating rate of interest equal to Term SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment (as defined in the Revolver) and a fixed margin dependent on our consolidated net leverage ratio ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%.\nUnder the Revolver, we must maintain a \u201cconsolidated net leverage\u201d ratio of no more than 4.00:1.00 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges.\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, we had $275 million outstanding balance under the Revolver (June\u00a030, 2022\u2014nil). For the year ended June\u00a030, 2023, we recorded interest expense of $10.1 million relating to the Revolver (June\u00a030, 2022\u2014nil). In July 2023, the Company subsequently repaid $175 million drawn under the Revolver.\nFor further details relating to our debt, please see Note\u00a011 \u201cLong-Term Debt\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAcquisition Term Loan\nOn December 1, 2022, we amended our first lien term loan facility (the Acquisition Term Loan), dated as of August 25, 2022, to increase the aggregate commitments under the senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility from an aggregate principal amount of $2.585 billion to an aggregate principal amount of $3.585 billion. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Company drew down $3.585 billion, net of original issuance discount of 3% and other fees, of which the net proceeds were used to fund the Micro Focus Acquisition (see Note\u00a019 \u201cAcquisitions\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details).\nThe Acquisition Term Loan has a seven-year term from the date of funding, and repayments under the Acquisition Term Loan are equal to 0.25% of the principal amount in equal quarterly installments for the life of the Acquisition Term Loan, with the remainder due at maturity. Borrowings under the Acquisition Term Loan currently bear a floating rate of interest equal to Term SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment (as defined in the Acquisition Term Loan) and applicable margin of 3.50%. As of June\u00a030, 2023, the outstanding balance on the Acquisition Term Loan bears an interest rate of 8.75%. As of June\u00a030, 2023, the Acquisition Term Loan bears an effective interest rate of 9.85%. The effective interest rate includes interest expense of $125.7 million and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $9.3 million.\nThe Acquisition Term Loan has incremental facility capacity of (i) $250 million plus (ii) additional amounts, subject to meeting a \u201cconsolidated senior secured net leverage\u201d ratio not exceeding 2.75:1.00, in each case subject to certain conditions. \n73\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of the Company\u2019s total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, that is secured by the Company\u2019s or any of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 assets, over the Company\u2019s trailing four financial quarter net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges. Under the Acquisition Term Loan, we must maintain a \u201cconsolidated net leverage\u201d ratio of no more than 4.50:1.00 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of the Company\u2019s total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over the Company\u2019s trailing four financial quarter net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges as defined in the Acquisition Term Loan. As of June\u00a030, 2023, our consolidated net leverage ratio, as calculated in accordance with the applicable agreement, was 3.49:1.\nThe Acquisition Term Loan is unconditionally guaranteed by certain subsidiary guarantors, as defined in the Acquisition Term Loan, and is secured by a first charge on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors on a pari passu basis with the Revolver, Term Loan B and the Senior Secured Notes 2027.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2023, we recorded interest expense of $125.7 million, relating to the Acquisition Term Loan (year ended June 30, 2022\u2014 nil).\nThe foregoing description of the Acquisition Term Loan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Acquisition Term Loan, which is filed as an exhibit to the Company\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 25, 2022.\nFor further details relating to our debt, please see Note\u00a011 \u201cLong-Term Debt\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBridge Loan\nOn August 25, 2022, we entered into a bridge loan agreement (Bridge Loan) which provided for commitments of up to $2.0 billion to finance a portion of the repayment of Micro Focus\u2019 existing debt. On December 1, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Bridge Loan that reallocated commitments under the Bridge Loan to the Acquisition Term Loan. In connection with the amendment to the Bridge Loan and the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes 2027, all remaining commitments under the Bridge Loan were reduced to zero and the Bridge Loan was terminated, which resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $8.2 million relating to unamortized debt issuance costs (see Note\u00a022 \u201cOther Income (Expense), Net\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details).\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, we had no borrowings under the Bridge Loan. For the year ended June 30, 2023, we did not record any interest expense relating to the Bridge Loan. \nThe foregoing description of the Bridge Loan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bridge Loan, which is filed as an exhibit to the Company\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 25, 2022.\nFor further details relating to our debt, please see Note\u00a011 \u201cLong-Term Debt\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nShelf Registration Statement \nOn December 6, 2021, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which became effective automatically (the Shelf Registration Statement). The Shelf Registration Statement allows for primary and secondary offerings from time to time of equity, debt and other securities, including Common Shares, Preference Shares, debt securities, depositary shares, warrants, purchase contracts, units and subscription receipts. A short-form base shelf prospectus qualifying the distribution of such securities was concurrently filed with Canadian securities regulators on December 6, 2021. The type of securities and the specific terms thereof will be determined at the time of any offering and will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement to be filed separately with the SEC and Canadian securities regulators.\nShare Repurchase Plan / Normal Course Issuer Bid\nOn November 5, 2020, the Board authorized a share repurchase plan (the Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan), pursuant to which we were authorized to purchase in open market transactions, from time to time over the 12 month period commencing November 12, 2020, up to an aggregate of $350\u00a0million of our Common Shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the TSX and/or other exchanges and alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules. The price that we were authorized to pay for Common Shares in open market transactions was the market price at the time of purchase or such other price as was permitted by applicable law or stock exchange rules. \n74\nTable of Contents\nThe Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan was effected in accordance with Rule 10b-18. Purchases made under the Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan were subject to a limit of 13,618,774 shares (representing 5% of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding Common Shares as of November 4, 2020). All Common Shares purchased by us pursuant to the Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan were cancelled.\nOn November 4, 2021, the Board authorized a share repurchase plan (the Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan), pursuant to which we were authorized to purchase in open market transactions, from time to time over the 12 month period commencing November 12, 2021, up to an aggregate of $350\u00a0million of our Common Shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the TSX (as part of a Fiscal 2022 Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB)) and/or other exchanges and alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules. The price that we paid for Common Shares in open market transactions was the market price at the time of purchase or such other price as was permitted by applicable law or stock exchange rules.\nThe Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan was effected in accordance with Rule 10b-18. All Common Shares purchased by us pursuant to the Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan were cancelled.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023, we did not repurchase and cancel any Common Shares (year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\u2014 3,809,559 and 2,500,000 Common Shares for $177.0 million and $119.1 million, respectively). \nNormal Course Issuer Bid\nThe Company established the Fiscal 2021 NCIB in order to provide it with a means to execute purchases over the TSX as part of the overall Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan.\nThe TSX approved the Company\u2019s notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2021 NCIB pursuant to which the Company was authorized to purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing November 12, 2020 until November 11, 2021 in accordance with the TSX\u2019s normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases were to be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of Common Shares that could be purchased in this period was 13,618,774 (representing 5% of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding Common Shares as of November 4, 2020), and the maximum number of Common Shares that could be purchased on a single day was 143,424 Common Shares, which was 25% of 573,699 (the average daily trading volume for the Common Shares on the TSX for the six months ended October 31, 2020), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18.\nThe Company renewed the NCIB in Fiscal 2022 in order to provide it with a means to execute purchases over the TSX as part of the overall Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan.\nThe TSX approved the Company\u2019s notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2022 NCIB pursuant to which the Company was authorized to purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing November 12, 2021 until November 11, 2022 in accordance with the TSX\u2019s normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases were to be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of Common Shares that could be purchased in this period was 13,638,008 (representing 5% of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding Common Shares as of October 31, 2021), and the maximum number of Common Shares that could be purchased on a single day was 112,590 Common Shares, which is 25% of 450,361 (the average daily trading volume for the Common Shares on the TSX for the six months ended October 31, 2021), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18.\n75\nTable of Contents\nPensions\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, our total unfunded pension plan obligations were $130.82 million, of which $4.50 million is payable within the next twelve months. We expect to be able to make the long-term and short-term payments related to these obligations in the normal course of operations. \nAnticipated pension payments under our defined benefit plans for the fiscal years indicated below are as follows:\nFiscal\u00a0years\u00a0ending June\u00a030,\n2024\n$\n13,115\u00a0\n2025\n13,221\u00a0\n2026\n14,258\u00a0\n2027\n16,146\u00a0\n2028\n17,745\u00a0\n2029 to 2033\n102,196\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n176,681\u00a0\nFor a detailed discussion on pensions, see Note\u00a012 \u201cPension Plans and Other Post Retirement Benefits\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations \nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, we have entered into the following contractual obligations with minimum payments for the indicated fiscal periods as follows: \n\u00a0\nPayments due between\n\u00a0\nTotal\nJuly 1, 2023 - June 30, 2024\nJuly 1, 2024 - June 30, 2026\nJuly 1, 2026 - June 30, 2028\nJuly 1, 2028 and beyond\nLong-term debt obligations \n(1)\n$\n12,424,286\u00a0\n$\n648,414\u00a0\n$\n2,373,260\u00a0\n$\n2,948,038\u00a0\n$\n6,454,574\u00a0\nOperating lease obligations \n(2)\n411,394\u00a0\n105,685\u00a0\n144,062\u00a0\n90,267\u00a0\n71,380\u00a0\nFinance lease obligations \n(3)\n11,482\u00a0\n5,712\u00a0\n5,311\u00a0\n459\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nPurchase obligations for contracts not accounted for as lease obligations \n176,440\u00a0\n52,588\u00a0\n108,346\u00a0\n15,506\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n13,023,602\u00a0\n$\n812,399\u00a0\n$\n2,630,979\u00a0\n$\n3,054,270\u00a0\n$\n6,525,954\u00a0\n________________________________________\n(1)\nIncludes interest up to maturity and principal payments.

Please see Note\u00a06 \u201cLeases\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\nGuarantees and Indemnifications\nWe have entered into customer agreements which may include provisions to indemnify our customers against third party claims that our software products or services infringe certain third-party intellectual property rights and for liabilities related to a breach of our confidentiality obligations. We have not made any material payments in relation to such indemnification provisions and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnification provisions in our Consolidated Financial Statements. \nOccasionally, we enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, guarantees relating to taxes and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \n76\nTable of Contents\nLitigation\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings.\nQuarterly, we review the status of each significant legal matter and evaluate such matters to determine how they should be treated for accounting and disclosure purposes in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 450-20 \u201cLoss Contingencies\u201d (Topic 450-20). Specifically, this evaluation process includes the centralized tracking and itemization of the status of all our disputes and litigation items, discussing the nature of any litigation and claim, including any dispute or claim that is reasonably likely to result in litigation, with relevant internal and external counsel, and assessing the progress of each matter in light of its merits and our experience with similar proceedings under similar circumstances.\nIf the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with Topic 450-20. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the aggregate of such accrued liabilities was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations and we do not believe as of the date of this filing that it is reasonably possible that a loss exceeding the amounts already recognized will be incurred that would be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. As described more fully below, we are unable at this time to estimate a possible loss or range of losses in respect of certain disclosed matters.\nContingencies\nCRA Matter\nAs part of its ongoing audit of our Canadian tax returns, the CRA has disputed our transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany transactions with our international subsidiaries and has issued notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016. Assuming the utilization of available tax attributes (further described below), we estimate our potential aggregate liability, as of June\u00a030, 2023, in connection with the CRA\u2019s reassessments for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, to be limited to penalties, interest and provincial taxes that may be due of approximately $76 million. As of June\u00a030, 2023, we have provisionally paid approximately $33\u00a0million in order to fully preserve our rights to object to the CRA\u2019s audit positions, being the minimum payment required under Canadian legislation while the matter is in dispute. This amount is recorded within \u201cLong-term income taxes recoverable\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June\u00a030, 2023.\nThe notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 would, as drafted, increase our taxable income by approximately $90 million to $100 million for each of those years, as well as impose a 10% penalty on the proposed adjustment to income. Audits by the CRA of our tax returns for fiscal years prior to Fiscal 2012 have been completed with no reassessment of our income tax liability.\nWe strongly disagree with the CRA\u2019s positions and believe the reassessments of Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 (including any penalties) are without merit, and we are continuing to contest these reassessments. On June 30, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the Tax Court of Canada seeking to reverse all such reassessments (including penalties) in full and the customary court process is ongoing.\nEven if we are unsuccessful in challenging the CRA\u2019s reassessments to increase our taxable income for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, we have elective deductions available for those years (including carry-backs from later years) that would offset such increased amounts so that no additional cash tax would be payable, exclusive of any assessed penalties and interest, as described above.\nThe CRA has audited Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018 on a basis that we strongly disagree with and are contesting. The focus of the CRA audit has been the valuation of certain intellectual property and goodwill when one of our subsidiaries continued into Canada from Luxembourg in July 2016. In accordance with applicable rules, these assets were recognized for tax purposes at fair market value as of that time, which value was supported by an expert valuation prepared by an independent leading accounting and advisory firm. CRA\u2019s position for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018 relies in significant part on the application of its positions regarding our transfer pricing methodology that are the basis for its reassessment of our fiscal years 2012 to 2016 described above, and that we believe are without merit. Other aspects of CRA\u2019s position for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018 conflict with the expert valuation prepared by the independent leading accounting and advisory firm that was used to support our original filing position. The CRA issued notices of reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018 on a basis consistent with its proposal to reduce the available depreciable basis of these assets in Canada. On April 19, 2022, we filed our notice of objection regarding the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 and on March 15, 2023, we filed our notice of objection regarding the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2018. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, the estimated impact of the proposed adjustment could result in us recording an income tax expense, with no immediate cash payment, to reduce the stated value of our deferred tax assets of up to approximately $470\u00a0million. Any such income tax expense could also have a corresponding cash tax impact that would primarily occur over a period of several future years based upon annual \n77\nTable of Contents\nincome realization in Canada. We strongly disagree with the CRA\u2019s position for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018 and intend to vigorously defend our original filing position. We are not required to provisionally pay any cash amounts to the CRA as a result of the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018 due to the utilization of available tax attributes; however, to the extent the CRA reassesses subsequent fiscal years on a similar basis, we expect to make certain minimum payments required under Canadian legislation, which may need to be provisionally made starting in Fiscal 2024 while the matter is in dispute. \nWe will continue to vigorously contest the adjustments to our taxable income and any penalty and interest assessments, as well as any reduction to the basis of our depreciable property. We are confident that our original tax filing positions were appropriate. Accordingly, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not recorded any accruals in respect of these reassessments or proposed reassessment in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The CRA is auditing Fiscal 2019, and may reassess Fiscal 2019 on a similar basis as Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018. The CRA is also in preliminary stages of auditing Fiscal 2020.\nCarbonite Class Action Complaint\nOn August 1, 2019, prior to our acquisition of Carbonite, a purported stockholder of Carbonite filed a putative class action complaint against Carbonite, its former Chief Executive Officer, Mohamad S. Ali, and its former Chief Financial Officer, Anthony Folger, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts captioned Ruben A. Luna, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Carbonite, Inc., Mohamad S. Ali, and Anthony Folger (No. 1:19-cv-11662-LTS) (the Luna Complaint). The complaint alleges violations of the federal securities laws under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint generally alleges that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements in connection with Carbonite\u2019s Server Backup VM Edition, and seeks, among other things, the designation of the action as a class action, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, costs and expenses, including counsel fees and expert fees, and other relief as the court deems appropriate. On August 23, 2019, a nearly identical complaint was filed in the same court captioned William Feng, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Carbonite, Inc., Mohamad S. Ali, and Anthony Folger (No. 1:19- cv-11808-LTS) (together with the Luna Complaint, the Securities Actions). On November 21, 2019, the district court consolidated the Securities Actions, appointed a lead plaintiff, and designated a lead counsel. On January 15, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint generally making the same allegations and seeking the same relief as the complaint filed on August 1, 2019. The defendants moved to dismiss the Securities Actions on March 10, 2020. On October 22, 2020, the district court granted with prejudice the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the Securities Actions. On November 20, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On December 21, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit issued a decision reversing and remanding the Securities Actions to the district court for further proceedings. The parties have completed discovery and defendants have filed a motion for summary judgment. The defendants remain confident in their position, believe the Securities Actions are without merit, and will continue to vigorously defend the matter.\nCarbonite vs Realtime Data\nOn February 27, 2017, before our acquisition of Carbonite, a non-practicing entity named Realtime Data LLC (Realtime Data) filed a lawsuit against Carbonite in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas captioned Realtime Data LLC v. Carbonite, Inc. et al (No 6:17-cv-00121-RWS-JDL). Therein, it alleged that certain of Carbonite\u2019s cloud storage services infringe upon certain patents held by Realtime Data. Realtime Data\u2019s complaint against Carbonite sought damages in an unspecified amount and injunctive relief. On December 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas transferred the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (No. 1:17-cv-12499). Realtime Data has also filed numerous other patent suits on the same asserted patents against other companies. After a stay pending appeal in one of those suits, on January 21, 2021, the district court held a hearing to construe the claims of the asserted patents. As to the fourth patent asserted against Carbonite, on September 24, 2019, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office Patent Trial and Appeal Board invalidated certain claims of that patent, including certain claims that had been asserted against Carbonite. The parties then jointly stipulated to dismiss that patent from this action. On August 23, 2021, in one of the suits against other companies, the District of Delaware (No. 1:17-cv-800), held all of the patents asserted against Carbonite to be invalid. Realtime Data has appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We continue to vigorously defend the matter, and the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts has issued a claim construction order. We have not accrued a loss contingency related to this matter because litigation related to a non-practicing entity is inherently unpredictable. Although a loss is reasonably possible, an unfavorable outcome is not considered by management to be probable at this time and we remain unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of loss associated with this litigation.\nOther Matters\nPlease also see Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2023, as well as Note\u00a015 \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K related to certain historical matters arising prior to the Micro Focus Acquisition.\n78\nTable of Contents\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \nWe do not enter into off-balance sheet financing as a matter of practice, except for guarantees relating to taxes and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business.\n79\nTable of Contents\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S.\u00a0GAAP, the Company provides certain financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP (Non-GAAP). These Non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not have a standardized meaning and thus the Company\u2019s definition may be different from similar Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and/or analysts and may differ from period to period. Thus, it may be more difficult to compare the Company\u2019s financial performance to that of other companies. However, the Company\u2019s management compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of these Non-GAAP financial measures both in its reconciliation to the U.S.\u00a0GAAP financial measures and its Consolidated Financial Statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company\u2019s results. \nThe Company uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the information provided in its Consolidated Financial Statements, which are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with U.S.\u00a0GAAP, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with and as a supplement to such U.S.\u00a0GAAP measures. OpenText strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. The Company therefore believes that despite these limitations, it is appropriate to supplement the disclosure of the U.S.\u00a0GAAP measures with certain Non-GAAP measures defined below.\nNon-GAAP-based net income and Non-GAAP-based EPS, attributable to OpenText, are consistently calculated as GAAP-based net income or earnings (loss) per share, attributable to OpenText, on a diluted basis, excluding the effects of the amortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation, and special charges (recoveries), all net of tax and any tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income, as further described in the tables below. Non-GAAP-based gross profit is the arithmetical sum of GAAP-based gross profit and the amortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets and share-based compensation within cost of sales. Non-GAAP-based gross margin is calculated as Non-GAAP-based gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Non-GAAP-based income from operations is calculated as GAAP-based income from operations, excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets, special charges (recoveries), and share-based compensation expense. \nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is consistently calculated as GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText, excluding interest income (expense), provision for (recovery of) income taxes, depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation and special charges (recoveries).\nThe Company\u2019s management believes that the presentation of the above defined Non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors because they portray the financial results of the Company before the impact of certain non-operational charges. The use of the term \u201cnon-operational charge\u201d is defined for this purpose as an expense that does not impact the ongoing operating decisions taken by the Company\u2019s management. These items are excluded based upon the way the Company\u2019s management evaluates the performance of the Company\u2019s business for use in the Company\u2019s internal reports and are not excluded in the sense that they may be used under U.S. GAAP. \nThe Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and therefore believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures, which in certain cases adjust for the impact of amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions, will provide readers of financial statements with a more consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and be more useful in helping readers understand the Company\u2019s operating results and underlying operational trends. Additionally, the Company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years, primarily due to acquisitions and most recently in response to our return to office planning, that have resulted in costs associated with reductions in headcount, consolidation of leased facilities and related costs, all which are recorded under the Company\u2019s \u201cSpecial charges (recoveries)\u201d caption on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Each restructuring activity is a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each differs in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope, and the size of each restructuring plan can vary significantly from period to period. Therefore, the Company believes that the exclusion of these special charges (recoveries) will also better aid readers of financial statements in the understanding and comparability of the Company\u2019s operating results and underlying operational trends. \nIn summary, the Company believes the provision of supplemental Non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the Company\u2019s core business using the same evaluation measures that management uses, and is therefore a useful indication of OpenText\u2019s performance or expected performance of future operations and facilitates period-to-period comparison of operating performance (although prior performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance). As a result, the Company considers it appropriate and reasonable to provide, in addition to U.S.\u00a0GAAP measures, supplementary Non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items from the presentation of its financial results.\nThe following charts provide unaudited reconciliations of U.S.\u00a0GAAP-based financial measures to Non-GAAP-based financial measures for the following periods presented. The Micro Focus Acquisition significantly impacts period-over-period comparability.\n80\nTable of Contents\nReconciliation of selected GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures \nfor the year ended June 30, 2023 \n(In thousands, except for per share data)\nYear Ended June 30, 2023\nGAAP-based Measures\nGAAP-based Measures \n% of Total Revenue\nAdjustments\nNote\nNon-GAAP-based Measures\nNon-GAAP-based Measures\n% of Total Revenue\nCost of revenues\nCloud services and subscriptions\n$\n590,165\u00a0\n$\n(10,664)\n(1)\n$\n579,501\u00a0\nCustomer support\n209,705\u00a0\n(3,627)\n(1)\n206,078\u00a0\nProfessional service and other\n276,888\u00a0\n(6,998)\n(1)\n269,890\u00a0\nAmortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets\n223,184\u00a0\n(223,184)\n(2)\n\u2014\u00a0\nGAAP-based gross profit and gross margin (%) / Non-GAAP-based gross profit and gross margin (%)\n3,168,393\u00a0\n70.6%\n244,473\u00a0\n(3)\n3,412,866\u00a0\n76.1%\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development\n680,587\u00a0\n(39,065)\n(1)\n641,522\u00a0\nSales and marketing\n948,598\u00a0\n(41,710)\n(1)\n906,888\u00a0\nGeneral and administrative\n419,590\u00a0\n(28,238)\n(1)\n391,352\u00a0\nAmortization of acquired customer-based intangible assets\n326,406\u00a0\n(326,406)\n(2)\n\u2014\u00a0\nSpecial charges (recoveries)\n169,159\u00a0\n(169,159)\n(4)\n\u2014\u00a0\nGAAP-based income from operations / Non-GAAP-based income from operations\n516,292\u00a0\n849,051\u00a0\n(5)\n1,365,343\u00a0\nOther income (expense), net\n34,469\u00a0\n(34,469)\n(6)\n\u2014\u00a0\nProvision for income taxes\n70,767\u00a0\n74,261\u00a0\n(7)\n145,028\u00a0\nGAAP-based net income / Non-GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText\n150,379\u00a0\n740,321\u00a0\n(8)\n890,700\u00a0\nGAAP-based EPS / Non-GAAP-based EPS-diluted, attributable to OpenText\n$\n0.56\u00a0\n$\n2.73\u00a0\n(8)\n$\n3.29\u00a0\n__________________________\n(1)\nAdjustment relates to the exclusion of share-based compensation expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as this expense is excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.\n(2)\nAdjustment relates to the exclusion of amortization expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as the timing and frequency of amortization expense is dependent on our acquisitions and is hence excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.\n(3)\nGAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based gross profit stated in dollars and gross margin stated as a percentage of total revenue.\n(4)\nAdjustment relates to the exclusion of special charges (recoveries) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as special charges (recoveries) are generally incurred in the periods relevant to an acquisition and include certain charges or recoveries that are not indicative or related to continuing operations and are therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.

Also excluded are tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves and \u201cbook to return\u201d adjustments for tax return filings and tax assessments. Included is the amount of net tax benefits arising from the internal reorganization that occurred in Fiscal 2017 assumed to be allocable to the current period based on the forecasted utilization period. In arriving at our Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%, we analyzed the individual adjusted expenses and took into consideration the impact of statutory tax rates from local jurisdictions incurring the expense.\n81\nTable of Contents\n(8)\nReconciliation of GAAP-based net income to Non-GAAP-based net income:\nYear Ended June 30, 2023\nPer share diluted\nGAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText\n$\n150,379\u00a0\n$\n0.56\u00a0\nAdd:\nAmortization\n549,590\u00a0\n2.03\u00a0\nShare-based compensation\n130,302\u00a0\n0.48\u00a0\nSpecial charges (recoveries)\n169,159\u00a0\n0.63\u00a0\nOther (income) expense, net\n(34,469)\n(0.13)\nGAAP-based provision for income taxes\n70,767\u00a0\n0.26\u00a0\nNon-GAAP-based recovery of income taxes\n(145,028)\n(0.54)\nNon-GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText\n$\n890,700\u00a0\n$\n3.29\u00a0\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\nYear Ended June 30, 2023\nGAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText\n$\n150,379\u00a0\nAdd:\nProvision for income taxes\n70,767\u00a0\nInterest and other related expense, net\n329,428\u00a0\nAmortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets\n223,184\u00a0\nAmortization of acquired customer-based intangible assets\n326,406\u00a0\nDepreciation\n107,761\u00a0\nShare-based compensation\n130,302\u00a0\nSpecial charges (recoveries)\n169,159\u00a0\nOther (income) expense, net\n(34,469)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,472,917\u00a0\n82\nTable of Contents\nReconciliation of selected GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures \nfor the year ended June 30, 2022 \n(In thousands, except for per share data)\nYear Ended June 30, 2022\nGAAP-based Measures\nGAAP-based Measures \n% of Total Revenue\nAdjustments\nNote\nNon-GAAP-based Measures\nNon-GAAP-based Measures\n% of Total Revenue\nCost of revenues\nCloud services and subscriptions\n$\n511,713\u00a0\n$\n(5,285)\n(1)\n$\n506,428\u00a0\nCustomer support\n121,485\u00a0\n(2,399)\n(1)\n119,086\u00a0\nProfessional service and other\n216,895\u00a0\n(3,740)\n(1)\n213,155\u00a0\nAmortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets\n198,607\u00a0\n(198,607)\n(2)\n\u2014\u00a0\nGAAP-based gross profit and gross margin (%) / Non-GAAP-based gross profit and gross margin (%)\n2,431,643\u00a0\n69.6%\n210,031\u00a0\n(3)\n2,641,674\u00a0\n75.6%\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development\n440,448\u00a0\n(17,122)\n(1)\n423,326\u00a0\nSales and marketing\n677,118\u00a0\n(22,628)\n(1)\n654,490\u00a0\nGeneral and administrative\n317,085\u00a0\n(18,382)\n(1)\n298,703\u00a0\nAmortization of acquired customer-based intangible assets\n217,105\u00a0\n(217,105)\n(2)\n\u2014\u00a0\nSpecial charges (recoveries)\n46,873\u00a0\n(46,873)\n(4)\n\u2014\u00a0\nGAAP-based income from operations / Non-GAAP-based income from operations\n644,773\u00a0\n532,141\u00a0\n(5)\n1,176,914\u00a0\nOther income (expense), net\n29,118\u00a0\n(29,118)\n(6)\n\u2014\u00a0\nProvision for income taxes\n118,752\u00a0\n23,913\u00a0\n(7)\n142,665\u00a0\nGAAP-based net income / Non-GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText\n397,090\u00a0\n479,110\u00a0\n(8)\n876,200\u00a0\nGAAP-based EPS / Non-GAAP-based EPS-diluted, attributable to OpenText\n$\n1.46\u00a0\n$\n1.76\u00a0\n(8)\n$\n3.22\u00a0\n__________________________\n(1)\nAdjustment relates to the exclusion of share-based compensation expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as this expense is excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.\n(2)\nAdjustment relates to the exclusion of amortization expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as the timing and frequency of amortization expense is dependent on our acquisitions and is hence excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.\n(3)\nGAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based gross profit stated in dollars and gross margin stated as a percentage of total revenue.\n(4)\nAdjustment relates to the exclusion of special charges (recoveries) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as special charges (recoveries) are generally incurred in the periods relevant to an acquisition and include certain charges or recoveries that are not indicative or related to continuing operations and are therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.

In arriving at our Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%, we analyzed the individual adjusted expenses and took into consideration the impact of statutory tax rates from local jurisdictions incurring the expense. The GAAP-based tax provision rate for the year ended June\u00a030, 2021 includes an income tax provision charge from IRS settlements partially offset by a tax benefit from the release of unrecognized tax benefits due to the conclusion of relevant tax audits that was recognized during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021.\n85\nTable of Contents\n(8)\nReconciliation of GAAP-based net income to Non-GAAP-based net income:\nYear Ended June 30, 2021\nPer share diluted\nGAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText\n$\n310,672\u00a0\n$\n1.14\u00a0\nAdd:\nAmortization\n435,340\u00a0\n1.59\u00a0\nShare-based compensation\n51,969\u00a0\n0.19\u00a0\nSpecial charges (recoveries)\n1,748\u00a0\n0.01\u00a0\nOther (income) expense, net\n(61,434)\n(0.22)\nGAAP-based provision for income taxes\n339,906\u00a0\n1.23\u00a0\nNon-GAAP-based recovery of income taxes\n(150,975)\n(0.55)\nNon-GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText\n$\n927,226\u00a0\n$\n3.39\u00a0\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\nYear Ended June 30, 2021\nGAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText\n$\n310,672\u00a0\nAdd:\nProvision for income taxes\n339,906\u00a0\nInterest and other related expense, net\n151,567\u00a0\nAmortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets\n218,796\u00a0\nAmortization of acquired customer-based intangible assets\n216,544\u00a0\nDepreciation\n85,265\u00a0\nShare-based compensation\n51,969\u00a0\nSpecial charges (recoveries)\n1,748\u00a0\nOther (income) expense, net\n(61,434)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,315,033\u00a0",
    "item7a": ">Item\u00a07A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates on our term loans, revolving loans and foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest rate risk\nOur exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to our Term Loan B, Revolver and Acquisition Term Loan. \nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, we had an outstanding balance of $947.5 million on the Term Loan B. Borrowings under the Term Loan B currently bear a floating rate of interest equal to Term SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment (as defined in the Term Loan B) and applicable margin of 1.75%. As of June\u00a030, 2023, an adverse change of 100 basis points on the interest rate would have the effect of increasing our annual interest payment on Term Loan B by approximately $9.5 million, assuming that the loan balance as of June\u00a030, 2023 is outstanding for the entire period (June\u00a030, 2022\u2014$9.6 million).\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, we had an outstanding balance of $275 million under the Revolver. Borrowings under the Revolver currently bear interest per annum at a floating rate of interest equal to Term SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment (as defined in the Revolver) and a fixed margin dependent on our consolidated net leverage ratio ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. As of June\u00a030, 2023, an adverse change of 100 basis points on the interest rate would have the effect of increasing our annual interest payment on the Revolver by approximately $2.8 million, assuming the loan balance as of June\u00a030, 2023 is outstanding for the entire period (June\u00a030, 2022\u2014nil).\n86\nTable of Contents\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, we had an outstanding balance of $3.6 billion under the Acquisition Term Loan. Borrowings under the Acquisition Term Loan currently bear a floating rate of interest equal to Term SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment (as defined in the Acquisition Term Loan) and applicable margin of 3.50%. As of June\u00a030, 2023, an adverse change of 100 basis points on the interest rate would have the effect of increasing our annual interest payment on the Acquisition Term Loan by approximately $35.7 million, assuming that the loan balance as of June\u00a030, 2023 is outstanding for the entire period (June\u00a030, 2022\u2014nil).\nForeign currency risk\nForeign currency transaction risk\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are expected to be cash settled in the near term and are transacted in non-functional currency. We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates. We have hedged certain of our Canadian dollar foreign currency exposures relating to our payroll expenses in Canada.\nBased on the CAD foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of June\u00a030, 2023, a one cent change in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate would have caused a change of $0.7 million in the mark-to-market valuation on our existing foreign exchange forward contracts (June\u00a030, 2022\u2014$0.5 million).\nAdditionally, in connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition, in August 2022, we entered into certain derivative transactions to meet certain foreign currency obligations related to the purchase price of the Micro Focus Acquisition, mitigate the risk of foreign currency appreciation in the GBP denominated purchase price and mitigate the risk of foreign currency appreciation in the EUR denominated existing debt held by Micro Focus. We entered into the following derivatives: (i) three deal-contingent forward contracts, (ii) a non-contingent forward contract, and (iii) EUR/USD cross currency swaps. In connection with the closing of the Micro Focus Acquisition the deal-contingent forward and non-deal contingent forward contracts were settled and we designated the 7-year EUR/USD cross currency swaps as net investment hedges.\nBased on the 5-year EUR/USD cross currency swaps outstanding as of June\u00a030, 2023, a one cent change in the Euro to U.S. dollar forward exchange rate would have caused a change of $7.3 million in the mark-to-market valuation on our existing cross currency swap (June\u00a030, 2022\u2014nil).\nBased on the 7-year EUR/USD cross currency swaps outstanding as of June\u00a030, 2023, a one cent change in the Euro to U.S. dollar forward exchange rate would have caused a change of $7.8 million in the mark-to-market valuation on our existing cross currency swaps (June\u00a030, 2022\u2014nil).\nForeign currency translation risk\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. dollars. In particular, the amount of cash and cash equivalents that we report in U.S. dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets). \nThe following table shows our cash and cash equivalents denominated in certain major foreign currencies as of June\u00a030, 2023 (equivalent in U.S. dollar):\n(In thousands)\nU.S.\u00a0Dollar\n\u00a0Equivalent\u00a0at \nJune\u00a030, 2023\nU.S.\u00a0Dollar\n\u00a0Equivalent\u00a0at \nJune\u00a030, 2022\nEuro\n$\n200,282\u00a0\n$\n254,546\u00a0\nBritish Pound\n69,108\u00a0\n44,020\u00a0\nIndian Rupee\n57,199\u00a0\n38,247\u00a0\nSwiss Franc\n53,122\u00a0\n48,674\u00a0\nOther foreign currencies\n218,663\u00a0\n103,453\u00a0\nTotal cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies\n598,374\u00a0\n488,940\u00a0\nU.S. Dollar\n633,251\u00a0\n1,204,801\u00a0\nTotal cash and cash equivalents \n$\n1,231,625\u00a0\n$\n1,693,741\u00a0\nIf overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10%, the amount of \n87\nTable of Contents\ncash and cash equivalents we would report in equivalent U.S. dollars would decrease by $59.8 million (June\u00a030, 2022\u2014$48.9 million), assuming we have not entered into any derivatives discussed above under \u201cForeign Currency Transaction Risk.\u201d",
