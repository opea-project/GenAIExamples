(\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cElectromed\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) develops,\nmanufactures, markets and sells innovative products that provide airway clearance therapy, including the SmartVest\n\u00ae\n\nAirway Clearance System (\u201cSmartVest System\u201d) and related products, to patients with compromised pulmonary function\nwith a commitment to excellence and compassionate service. Our goal is to make High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (\u201cHFCWO\u201d)\ntreatments as effective, convenient, and comfortable as possible, so our patients can breathe easier and live better with improved\nrespiratory function and fewer exacerbations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nemploy a direct-to-patient and provider model, through which we obtain patient referrals from clinicians, manage insurance claims\non behalf of our patients, and deliver the SmartVest System to patients, training them on proper use in their homes. This model\nallows us to directly approach patients and clinicians, whereby we disintermediate the traditional durable medical equipment (\u201cDME\u201d)\nchannel and capture both the manufacturer and distributor margins. We also sell our products in the acute care setting for patients\nin a post-surgical or intensive care unit, or who were admitted for a lung infection brought on by compromised airway clearance.\nElectromed was incorporated in Minnesota in 1992. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE American under the ticker symbol \u201cELMD.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nSmartVest System features a programmable air pulse generator, a therapy garment worn over the upper body and a connecting hose,\nwhich together provide safe, comfortable, and effective airway clearance therapy. The SmartVest System generates HFCWO, an airway\nclearance therapy. One factor of respiratory health is the ability to clear secretions from airways. Impaired airway clearance,\nwhen mucus cannot be expectorated, may result in labored breathing and/or inflammatory and immune systems boosting mucus production\nthat invites bacteria trapped in stagnant secretions to cause infections. Studies show that HFCWO therapy is as effective an airway\nclearance method for patients who have compromised pulmonary function as traditional chest physical therapy (\u201cCPT\u201d)\nadministered by a respiratory therapist.\n1\n However, HFCWO can be self-administered, relieving a caregiver of participation\nin the therapy, and eliminating the attendant cost of an in-home care provider. We believe that HFCWO treatments are cost-effective\nprimarily because they reduce a patient\u2019s risk of respiratory infections and other secondary complications that are associated\nwith impaired airway clearance and often result in costly hospital visits and repeated antibiotic use.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nSmartVest System is designed for patient comfort and ease of use which promotes adherence to prescribed treatment schedules, leading\nto improved airway clearance, patient outcomes and quality of life, and a reduction in healthcare utilization. We offer a broad\nrange of garments, referred to as vests and wraps, in sizes for children and adults that allow for tailored fit. User-friendly\ncontrols allow patients to administer their daily therapy with minimal or no assistance. Our direct product support services provide\npatient and clinician education, training, and follow-up to ensure that the product is integrated into each patient\u2019s daily\ntreatment regimen. Additionally, our reimbursement department assures we are working on behalf of the patient by processing their\nphysician paperwork, providing clinical support and billing the applicable insurance provider. We believe that the advantages\nof the SmartVest System and the Company\u2019s customer services to the patient include:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nimproved\nquality of life;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nreduction\nin healthcare utilization;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nindependence\nfrom a dedicated caregiver;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nconsistent\ntreatments at home;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nimproved\ncomfort during therapy; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\neligibility\nfor reimbursement by private insurance, federal or state government programs or combinations of the foregoing.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1\nNicolini\nA, et al.

Our products are sold\ninto the home health care market and the acute care setting for patients in a post-surgical or intensive care unit, or who were\nadmitted for a lung infection brought on by compromised airway clearance. Accordingly, our sales points of contact include adult\npulmonology clinics, cystic fibrosis centers, neuromuscular clinics and hospitals.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nhave received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) to market the SmartVest System to promote\nairway clearance and improve bronchial drainage. In addition, Electromed is certified to apply the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne\n(\u201cEuropean Conformity\u201d or \u201cCE\u201d) marking for HFCWO device sales in all European Union member countries\nand approved for HFCWO device sales in other, select international countries. The SmartVest System is available only with a physician\u2019s\nprescription.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nSmartVest System is currently available in two models, The SmartVest SQL\n\u00ae\n and SmartVest Clearway\n\u00ae\n\u2013\nwhich are sold into home care and hospital markets. In November 2022, we announced the introduction of SmartVest Clearway\n\u00ae\n,\nour next generation HFCWO system designed around an enhanced patient experience and modern design. We will continue to support\nand service earlier SmartVest models pursuant to the applicable product warranty. As part of our growth strategies, we periodically\nevaluate opportunities involving products and services, especially those that may provide value to the respiratory homecare and\ninstitutional market.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nSmartVest Clearway System \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nSmartVest Clearway System consists of an inflatable therapy garment, a programmable air pulse generator and a patented single-hose\nthat delivers air pulses from the generator to the garment to create oscillatory pressure on the chest wall. The SmartVest Clearway\nis designed for maximum comfort and lifestyle convenience, so patients can readily fit therapy into their daily routines. The\nSmartVest Clearway was designed with the patient experience in mind continuing our history of offering the smallest, lightest\nweight generator on the market and introduces an intuitive touch screen to simplify use. The enhanced features make it easier\nto use and enable greater patient freedom in completing therapy.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n360\u00b0\n                                         oscillation coverage and patented Soft Start\n(R)\n technology: \nAll SmartVest\n                                         garments provide 360\u00b0 oscillation coverage, which delivers simultaneous treatment\n                                         to all lobes of the lungs. The oscillatory squeeze-and-release technology delivers therapeutic\n                                         pressure to the chest wall to loosen, sheer and propel mucus into the upper airways where\n                                         it can be more easily expectorated. Our patented Soft Start technology gently inflates\n                                         the garment to better acclimate the patient to therapy.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nOpen\n                                         system design with Breathing Room\nTM\n:\n The active inflate \u2013 active\n                                         deflate mechanism of the SmartVest System enables patients to take deep breaths during\n                                         therapy without feeling restricted, providing patients with a more comfortable treatment\n                                         experience.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nProgrammable\n                                         generator with user-friendly device operation:\n The SmartVest Clearway introduces\n                                         an intuitive touchscreen with single touch start. The improved user interface enhances\n                                         device programming and simplifies every-day use. The system features multiple operating\n                                         modes, including ramp, favorite settings designations, and options for saving, locking\n                                         and restoring protocols. An enhanced pause feature allows the physician to program dedicated\n                                         times for the patient to clear secretions during therapy.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nPatented\n                                         single-hose design:\n A single-hose delivers oscillations to the SmartVest garment,\n                                         which we believe provides therapy in a more comfortable and unobtrusive manner than a\n                                         two-hose system. Oscillations are delivered evenly from the base of the SmartVest garment,\n                                         extending the forces upward and inward in strong but smooth cycles surrounding the chest.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nSoft-fabric\n                                         garment is lightweight and comfortable:\n The SmartVest garment is the lightest HFCWO\n                                         garment available and is designed to resemble an article of clothing. The light design\n                                         takes weight off of the patients shoulders and torso enhancing the therapy experience.\n                                         Quick fit Velcro\n\u00ae\n-like closures allow for a secure, comfortable fit without\n                                         bulky straps and buckles. The simple design creates a broad size adjustment range to\n                                         ensure a properly tailored fit to accommodate pediatric and adult patients.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nSmaller\n                                         and lighter: \nSmartVest Clearway is the smallest and lightest HFCWO generator on the\n                                         market, weighing less than 14 pounds. The lightweight design, ergonomic carrying handle\n                                         and compact storage case make it easier for patients to move throughout their home, store\n                                         and integrate HFCWO therapy into their daily lives.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSmartVest\nConnect \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn\nJune 2017, we launched SmartVest Connect\n\u00ae\n wireless technology, a personalized HFCWO therapy management portal for\npatients with compromised pulmonary function. In March 2020, we launched the SmartVest Connect app for both the iOS and Android\noperating systems. The SmartVest Connect app securely connects to the SmartVest System through Bluetooth\u2122 technology. This\ninterface allows patients and healthcare teams to track therapy in real-time and collaborate on care decisions to improve therapy\nadherence and patient outcomes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOther\nProducts\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nmarket the Single Patient Use (\u201cSPU\u201d) SmartVest and SmartVest Wrap\n\u00ae\n to health care providers in the\nacute care setting. Hospitals issue the SPU SmartVest or SmartVest Wrap to an individual patient for managing airway clearance\nwhile inpatient. Both SPU products provide full coverage oscillation and facilitate continuity of care when the SmartVest System\nis prescribed for patients with a chronic condition upon discharge for use in the home.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur\nMarket\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nestimate the total served U.S. market for HFCWO is approximately $250 million in 2022 growing at a 9% compound annual growth rate\nbased on independent third-party market research. We believe the market for HFCWO is under recognized and underdiagnosed and is\ncontinuing to expand due to an aging population, higher incidence of chronic lung disease, growing awareness by physicians of\ndiseases and conditions for which patients can benefit from using HFCWO therapy, and treatments moving to lower cost home care\nsettings. Indications for when HFCWO may be prescribed are not specific to any one disease. A physician may elect to prescribe\nHFCWO when such individual believes the patient will benefit from improved airway clearance and external chest manipulation is\nthe treatment of choice to enhance mucus transport and improve bronchial drainage.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nSmartVest System is primarily prescribed for patients with bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and neuromuscular conditions such\nas cerebral palsy and ALS. We believe that bronchiectasis represents the fastest growing diagnostic category and greatest potential\nfor HFCWO growth in the United States exhibiting an 8.7% increase in patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2007\n9\n. Bronchiectasis\nis an irreversible, chronic lung condition characterized by enlarged and permanently damaged bronchi. The condition is associated\nwith recurrent lower respiratory infections, inflammation, reduction in pulmonary function, impaired respiratory secretion clearance,\nincreased hospitalizations and medication use, and increased morbidity and mortality.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nare driven to make life\u2019s important moments possible, one breath at a time, by leading the HFCWO therapy market in clinical\nevidence that supports the therapeutic imperative of clearing excess mucus from the lungs. Electromed continues to add to the\nbody of evidence in support of HFCWO with multiple published clinical outcome studies demonstrating a significant improvement\nin quality of life and reduction in exacerbation rates, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and antibiotic prescriptions\nin bronchiectasis patients using the SmartVest System. This includes a 2022 publication in the American Journal of Respiratory\nand Critical Care Medicine reviewing outcomes among non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis patients with HFCWO Therapy\n2-6. \nIn\naddition, we designed and ran a quality-of-life study for COPD patients using SmartVest, which was shared at the 2023 American\nThoracic Society International Conference and published in American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. The study\u2019s\nresults demonstrated statistically significant favorable responses to HFCWO as add on therapy for patients with a primary diagnosis\nof COPD. We have also shared data from our bronchiectasis quality of life trial at the 2023 World Bronchiectasis and NTM Conference\nhighlight effects of HFCWO on clinical symptoms of patients with bronchiectasis Generating additional clinical evidence to further\nsupport the SmartVest System as a preferred treatment for bronchiectasis patients will remain a focus in fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n3\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nbelieve that bronchiectasis is under recognized and underdiagnosed but is experiencing a surge in clinical interest and awareness,\nincluding the relationship to COPD, commonly referred to as bronchiectasis COPD overlap syndrome. The overlap of bronchiectasis\nand COPD increases exacerbations and hospitalizations, reduces pulmonary function, and increases mortality. Several recent studies\nhave estimated prevalence of bronchiectasis, which we believe are helpful for estimating a range of the overall market size.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nWeycker\n(2017) projected 4.2 million adults in the United States over the age of 40 may have bronchiectasis, suggesting there is a large\npool of patients with undiagnosed disease.\n7\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nHenkle\n(2018) confirmed a high prevalence of bronchiectasis in the United States, identifying over 600,000 unique patients with at least\none bronchiectasis claim (ICD-9 claims 494.0 or 494.1). The study also observed that patients with dual diagnosis of bronchiectasis\nand COPD were in poorer health, with more office visits, more inpatient admissions and more acute respiratory infections.\n8\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nSeitz\n(2012) estimated that 190,000 unique cases of bronchiectasis were diagnosed in Medicare patients in 2007 and bronchiectasis prevalence\nincreased 8.7% annually between 2000 and 2007.\n9\n Based on historic growth in prevalence and assuming a constant growth\nrate, the estimated number of bronchiectasis diagnoses in Medicare patients in 2021 exceeded 608,000.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nAksamit\n(2017) found 20% (n=350) of patients with bronchiectasis enrolled in the U.S. Bronchiectasis Research Registry between 2008 and\n2014 also had COPD and 29% (n=515) also had asthma.\n7 \nOther studies have found that the overlap between bronchiectasis\nand COPD is observed in 27% to 57% of patients with COPD. \n10-13\u20138\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nChalmers\n(2017) found that prevalence of bronchiectasis in patients with COPD ranged from a low of 4% to as high as 69% with mean prevalence\nof 54%. In many studies in patients with COPD, the presence of bronchiectasis was associated with reduced lung function, greater\nsputum production, more frequent exacerbations and increased mortality versus those with COPD alone.\n14\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThese\nstudies indicate a wide range of potential prevalence of bronchiectasis patients in the United States. We also believe that it\nis difficult to estimate from these studies which patients will need or benefit from HFCWO. Internal company estimates derived\nfrom 2020 analysis of the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus database, one of the largest US health plan databases of adjudicated integrated\nmedical and pharmacy claims, indicate a 15% to 20% penetration of HFCWO within the diagnosed Bronchiectasis population\n15\n.\nBy conservatively assessing the market size in relation to the clinical studies cited above, we calculate that current HFCWO adoption\nmay account for only 100,000 patients of the 500,000 to 600,000 currently diagnosed and treatable patients (see Figure 1 below).\nWe believe that bronchiectasis is underdiagnosed in the U.S. based on clinical study and epidemiology evidence with an even greater\nnumber of patients that could potentially benefit from diagnosis and treatment. We believe that HFCWO is under prescribed for\nbronchiectasis patients resulting in a large, underpenetrated US market opportunity and growth potential for HFCWO therapy.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2\nSievert\nC, et al.

Results show that at one-year: exacerbations requiring\n                                         hospitalization and antibiotic use were significantly reduced and mean forced expiratory\n                                         volume remained stable post enrollment, suggesting early initiation of HFCWO therapy\n                                         may slow the otherwise normal progression of the disease.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nIn\n                                         2022, the American Journal of Respiratory and Crucial Care Medicine published the results\n                                         of a third-party retrospective cohort analysis of 101 qualifying NCFBE patients who received\n                                         HFCWO. Key findings revealed that patients who used HFCWO therapy experienced improved\n                                         health outcomes, a reduction in healthcare resource utilization and reduction in medication\n                                         usage.\n6\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMarketing,\nSales and Distribution\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur\nsales and marketing efforts are focused on driving adoption of our products and services with physicians, clinicians, patients,\nand third-party payers and building market awareness to the benefits of HFCWO for treatment of bronchiectasis. Because the sale\nof the SmartVest System requires a physician\u2019s prescription, we market to physicians and health care providers as well as\ndirectly to patients. Most of our revenue comes from domestic homecare sales through a physician referral model. We have established\nour own domestic sales force and support network, which we believe is able to provide superior education, support, and training\nto our customers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n5\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur\ndirect U.S. sales force works with physicians and clinicians, primarily pulmonologists, in defined territories to help them understand\nour products and services and the value they provide to their respective patients. As of June 30, 2023, we had 55 field sales\nemployees, including six regional sales managers, 46 clinical area managers (\u201cCAMs\u201d) and three clinical educators.\nWe also have developed a network of approximately 170 respiratory therapists and health care professionals across the U.S. to\nassist with in-home SmartVest System patient training on a non-exclusive, independent contractor basis. These independent contractors\nare credentialed by the National Board for Respiratory Care as either Certified Respiratory Therapists or Registered Respiratory\nTherapists and provide national coverage to an internal team of Registered Respiratory Therapists dedicated to supporting SmartVest\npatients. Additionally, Electromed employs a team of reimbursement specialists dedicated to managing insurance and payer relations\nand supporting prescribers and patients in navigating financial considerations. The availability of reimbursement is an important\nconsideration for health care professionals and patients. Because our product has an assigned Healthcare Common Procedure Coding\nSystem (\u201cHCPCS\u201d) code, a claim can be billed for reimbursement using that code. We must demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our products to public and private insurance providers. The availability of reimbursement exists primarily due to an established\nHCPCS code for HFCWO. A HCPCS code is assigned to services and products by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOf\nthe $47.6 million of our revenue derived from the U.S. in fiscal 2023, approximately 92% represented home care and 4% represented\nhospital sales. We expect to achieve future sales, earnings, and overall market share growth through a continued focus on product\ninnovation, differentiation and improved patient experiences and outcomes in the home care segment. We believe that our position\nin the market, direct sales team and a dedication to advancing education on HFCWO awareness positions us to drive market awareness\nand growth to the benefits of HFCWO in treatment of bronchiectasis. We believe that dedicated service to our providers and patients\nis a key component of achieving future sales. Providers seek companies that are easy to work with, are responsive and care for\ntheir patients as an extension of their practices.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\ngenerate sales interest through multiple channels that include visits to pulmonology clinics and medical centers, participation\nin medical conferences, maintenance of industry contacts to increase the visibility and acceptance of our products by physicians\nand health care professionals, support of industry events such as the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation World Bronchiectasis Day and\nAmerican Lung Association Fight for Air Climb, as well as through a focus on increasing patients by word of mouth and traffic\nto our website and social media channels. We continue to evaluate opportunities to offer the SmartVest System through selected\nHome Medical Equipment (\u201cHME\u201d) distributors. We maintain agreements with a limited number of HME distributors to distribute\nand sell the SmartVest System in the United States home care market. We expect to continue our direct sales channel as our primary\nhomecare revenue source.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInternational\nMarketing \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApproximately\n1% of our net revenues were from sales outside of the U.S. in both of our fiscal 2023 and our fiscal year ended June 30, 2022\n(\u201cfiscal 2022\u201d), respectively. We sell our products outside of the U.S. primarily through independent distributors\nspecializing in respiratory products. Through June 30, 2023, most of our distributors operated in exclusive territories. Our principal\ndistributors are located in Europe, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Southeast Asia, South America and Central America. Units\nare sold at a fixed contract price with payments made directly from the distributor, rather than being tied to reimbursement rates\nof a patient\u2019s insurance provider as is the case for domestic sales. Our sales strategy outside of the U.S. is to maintain\nour current distributors with less emphasis on contracting with new distributors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThird-Party\nReimbursement\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn\nthe U.S., individuals who use the SmartVest System generally rely on third-party payers, including private payers and governmental\npayers such as Medicare and Medicaid, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of using the SmartVest System. Our home care\nrevenue comes from reimbursement from commercial payers, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs and direct patient payments. Reimbursement\nfor HFCWO therapy and the SmartVest System varies among public and private insurance providers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA\nkey strategy to grow sales is achieving world class customer service and support for our patients and clinicians and increasing\nthe number of covered lives across a broad payer market. We do this with an established and effective reimbursement department\nworking on behalf of the patient by processing physician paperwork, seeking insurance authorization and processing claims. The\nskill and knowledge gained and offered by our reimbursement department is an important factor in building our revenue and serving\npatients\u2019 financial interests. Our payment terms generally allow patients to acquire the SmartVest System over a period\nof one to 15 months, which is consistent with reimbursement procedures followed by Medicare and other third parties. The payment\namount we receive for any single referral may vary based on several factors, including Medicare and third-party reimbursement\nprocesses and policies. The reimbursement department includes the payer relations function working directly with all payer types\nto increase the covered lives for the SmartVest System with national and regional private insurers and applicable state and federal\ngovernment entities as well as to maintain the current licenses with state and federal government and payer contracts.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n6\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur\nSmartVest System is reimbursed under HCPCS code E0483. Currently, the Medicare total allowable amount of reimbursement for this\nbilling code is approximately $15,000. The allowed amount for state Medicaid programs ranges from approximately $8,000 to $15,000,\nwhich is similar to commercial payers. Actual reimbursement from third-party payers can vary and can be significantly less than\nthe full allowable amount. Deductions from the allowable amount, such as co-payments, deductibles and/or maximums on durable medical\nequipment, decrease the reimbursement received from the third-party payer. Collecting a full allowable amount depends on our ability\nto obtain reimbursement from the patient\u2019s secondary and/or supplemental insurance if the patient has additional coverage,\nor our ability to collect amounts from individual patients.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMost\npatients can qualify for reimbursement and payment from Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance or combinations of the foregoing.\nOur sales continue to be dependent, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, even though\nour devices have been cleared for marketing by the FDA. The way reimbursement is sought and obtained varies based upon the type\nof payer involved and the setting in which the procedure is furnished.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResearch\nand Development\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur\nresearch and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) capabilities consist of full-time engineering staff and several consultants.\nWe periodically engage consultants and contract engineering employees to supplement our development initiatives. Our team has\na demonstrated record of developing new products that receive the appropriate product approvals and regulatory clearances around\nthe world as demonstrated by the FDA 510(k) clearance for the SmartVest Clearway Airway Clearance System received November 2022.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDuring\nfiscal 2023 and 2022, we incurred R&D expenses of approximately $916,000 and $1,356,000, or 1.9% and 3.3% of our net revenues,\nrespectively. As a percentage of sales, we expect spending on R&D expenses to remain within a range of 1-2% of net revenues\nfor fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIntellectual\nProperty \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs\nof June 30, 2023, we held 12 United States and 41 foreign-issued patents covering the SmartVest System and its underlying technology\nand had 9 pending United States and foreign patent applications. These patents and patent applications offer coverage in the field\nof air pressure pulse delivery to a human in support of airway clearance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\ngenerally pursue patent protection for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices in foreign countries that we have\nidentified as key markets for our products. These markets include the European Union, Japan, and other countries.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nalso have received 13 U.S. and 111 foreign trademark and service mark registrations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManufacturing\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur\nheadquarters in New Prague, Minnesota includes a dedicated manufacturing and engineering facility of more than 14,000 square feet,\nand we are certified on an annual basis to be compliant with International Organization for Standardization (\u201cISO\u201d)\n13485 quality system standards. Our site has been audited regularly by the FDA and ISO, in accordance with their practices, and\nwe maintain our operations in a manner consistent with their requirements for a medical device manufacturer. While components\nare outsourced to meet our detailed specifications, each SmartVest System is assembled, tested, and approved for final shipment\nat our manufacturing site in New Prague, consistent with FDA, Underwriters Laboratory, and ISO standards. Many of our strategic\nsuppliers are located within 100 miles of our headquarters, which enables us to closely monitor our component supply chain. We\nmaintain established inventory levels for critical components and finished goods to assure continuity of supply. During fiscal\n2022 and 2023, we experienced longer lead times for critical electronic components related to worldwide supply shortages due to\nCOVID-19 and the related U.S. and global economic recovery.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n7\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProduct\nWarranties\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nprovide a warranty on the SmartVest System that covers the cost of replacement parts and labor, or a new SmartVest System in the\nevent we determine a full replacement is necessary. For each homecare SmartVest System initially purchased and currently located\nin the U.S. and Canada, we provide a lifetime warranty to the individual patient for whom the SmartVest System is prescribed.\nFor sales to institutions and HME distributors within the U.S., and for all international sales, except Canadian home care, we\nprovide a three-year warranty.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCompetition\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\noriginal HFCWO technology was licensed to American Biosystems, Inc. (formerly Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc., now part of Baxter International\nInc.) (\u201cBaxter\u201d), which, until the introduction of our original MedPulse Respiratory Vest System\n\u00ae\n in\n2000, was the only manufacturer of a product with HFCWO technology cleared for market by the FDA (Hill Rom\u2019s The Vest\n\u00ae\n\nAirway Clearance System). Respiratory Technologies, Inc. (formerly RespirTech, now part of Koninklijke Phillips N.V.) (\u201cPhilips\u201d)\nreceived FDA clearance to market their HFCWO product, the inCourage\n\u00ae\n Airway Clearance Therapy in 2005. Both Baxter\nand Philips employ a direct-to-patient model, with Philips additionally offering its HFCWO device through selected DME distributors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nAffloVest\n\u00ae\n from Tactile Systems Technology Inc. (\u201cTactile Medical\u201d) also participates in the same market\nas our SmartVest System. Tactile Medical primarily sells its device through DME companies who distribute home care medical devices\nand supplies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlternative\nproducts for administering pulmonary therapy include: Positive Expiratory Pressure, Intrapulmonary Percussive Ventilation, CPT\nand breathing techniques. Physicians may prescribe some or all of these devices and techniques, depending upon each patient\u2019s\nhealth status, severity of disease, compliance, or personal preference.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKey\ndrivers of HFCWO product sales continue to be improved quality of life through documented clinical outcomes and reduction in healthcare\ncosts through resource utilization evidence. Technology innovations and enhancements to the patient experience such as size, weight\nof the generator, and optimized user interaction increase product reputation and patient satisfaction. We believe we distinguish\nourselves in these areas with competitive advantages over alternative treatments ultimately improving the patient comfort, ease\nof use, and the effectiveness of HFCWO treatment. Because HFCWO is not \u201ctechnique dependent,\u201d as compared to most\nother alternative pulmonary therapy products, therapy remains consistent and controlled for the duration of treatment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGovernmental\nRegulation\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMedicare\nand Medicaid\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRecent\ngovernment and private sector initiatives in the U.S. and foreign countries aim at limiting the growth of health care costs including:\nprice regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments,\nand managed-care arrangements. These initiatives are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more\ncost-effective medical devices that result in better clinical outcomes. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid,\nhave attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement the program will pay for procedures or treatments, restricting\ncoverage for certain products or services, and implementing other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs.\nMany private insurance programs look to Medicare as a guide in setting coverage policies and payment amounts. These initiatives\nhave created an increasing level of price sensitivity among our customers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHome\nMedical Equipment Licensing\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough\nwe do not fall under competitive bidding for Medicare, we often must satisfy the same licensing requirements as other DME providers\nthat qualify for competitive bidding. In response to out-of-state businesses winning the competitive bidding process, which had\na significant impact on small local DME businesses, many states have enacted regulations that require a DME provider to have an\nin-state business presence, specifically through state HME licensing boards or through state Medicaid programs. In order to do\nbusiness with any patients in the state or to be a provider for the state Medicaid program, a DME provider must have an in-state\npresence. In addition to Minnesota, the location of our corporate headquarters, we have a licensed in-state presence in three\nother states. We also maintain an in-state presence in California to meet their state Medicaid requirements. In-state presence\nrequirements vary from state to state, but generally require a physical location that is staffed and open during regular business\nhours. We are licensed to do business in all states except for Alaska and Hawaii.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n8\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProduct\nRegulations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur\nmedical devices are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory\nagencies. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development,\ntesting, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our medical devices, and compliance with these laws and regulations\nentails significant costs for us. Our regulatory and quality assurance departments provide detailed oversight in their areas of\nresponsibility to support required clearances and approvals to market our products.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn\naddition to the clearances and approvals discussed below, we obtained ISO 13485 certification in January 2005 and receive annual\ncertification of our compliance to the current ISO quality standards.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFDA\nRequirements\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nhave received clearance from the FDA to market our products, including the SmartVest System. We may be required to obtain additional\nFDA clearance before marketing a new or modified product in the U.S., either through the 510(k)-clearance process or the more\ncomplex premarket approval process. The process may be time consuming and expensive, particularly if human clinical trials are\nrequired. Failure to obtain such clearances or approvals could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nContinuing\nProduct Regulation\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn\naddition to its approval processes for new products, the FDA may require testing and post-market surveillance programs to monitor\nthe safety and effectiveness of previously cleared products that have been commercialized and may prevent or limit further marketing\nof products based on the results of post-mark surveillance results. At any time after marketing clearance of a product, the FDA\nmay conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with both the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d)\nrequirements and current medical device reporting regulations. Product approvals by the FDA can be withdrawn due to failure to\ncomply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial market clearance. The failure to comply\nwith regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines,\ndelays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products (with the attendant expenses), the banning of\na particular device, an order to replace or refund the cost of any device previously manufactured or distributed, operating restrictions\nand criminal prosecution, as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nmust register annually with the FDA as a device manufacturer and, as a result, are subject to periodic FDA inspection for compliance\nwith the FDA\u2019s QSR requirements that require us to adhere to certain extensive regulations. In addition, the federal Medical\nDevice Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests\nthat a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute\nto a death or serious injury. We also must maintain certain certifications to sell products internationally, and we undergo periodic\ninspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertising\nand marketing of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission\nand by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies\nhave been the subject of enforcement action brought under health care reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. Competitors\nand others also can initiate litigation relating to advertising and/or marketing claims. If the FDA were to determine our promotional\nor training materials constitute promotion of an unapproved or uncleared claim of use, it is possible we would need to modify\nour training or promotional materials or be subject to regulatory or enforcement actions that could result in civil fines or criminal\npenalties. Other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities could also take similar action if they were to determine that\nour promotional or training materials constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n9\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEuropean\nUnion and Other Regions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEuropean\nUnion rules require that medical products receive the right to affix the CE mark, demonstrating adherence to quality standards\nand compliance with relevant European Union Medical Device Directives (\u201cMDD\u201d). Products that bear CE mark can be imported\nto, sold or distributed within the European Union. We obtained clearance to use the CE mark on our products in April 2005. Renewal\nof CE marking is required every five years, and our notified body performs an annual audit to ensure that we are in compliance\nwith all applicable regulations. We have maintained our CE marking in good standing since originally receiving it and most recently\nrenewed it in January 2020. The renewal of our MDD certificate will allow us to continue to CE mark and sell our SmartVest SQL\ndevice, with no substantial changes, in the European Union until the certificate expires in May 2024. We are currently working\non finalizing updates to the quality system to achieve full compliance with Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (EU MDR) which came into\neffect in May 2021. We also require all our distributors in the European Union and other regions to comply with their home country\nregulations in our distributor agreements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFederal\nPhysician Payments Sunshine Act\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nFederal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (Section 6002 of the PPACA) (the \u201cSunshine Act\u201d) was adopted on February 1,\n2013, to create transparency for the financial relationship between medical device companies and physicians and/or teaching hospitals\n(covered recipients). In January 2021, the Sunshine Act was expanded to cover payments made to these additional covered recipients,\nphysician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives.\nThe Sunshine Act requires all manufacturers of drugs and medical devices to annually report to CMS any payments or any other \u201ctransfers\nof value\u201d made to any covered recipients, including but not limited to consulting fees, grants, clinical research support,\nroyalties, honoraria, meals, and value of long-term use (over 90 days) of evaluation equipment. This information is then posted\non a public website so that consumers can learn how much was paid to their physician by drug and medical device companies. The\nSunshine Act requires ongoing data collection and annual management and reporting by us and imposes civil penalties for manufacturers\nthat fail to report timely, accurately, or completely to CMS.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFraud\nand Abuse Laws\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFederal\nhealth care laws apply to the marketing of our products and when we or our customers submit claims for items or services that\nare reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally funded health care programs. The principal applicable federal laws\ninclude:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nthe\n                                         False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims\n                                         for payment to a federally funded health care program;\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nthe\n                                         Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits offers to pay or receive remuneration of any kind\n                                         for the purpose of inducing or rewarding referrals of items or services reimbursable\n                                         by a federal health care program; and\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nthe\n                                         Stark Law, which prohibits physicians from profiting (actually or potentially) from their\n                                         own referrals.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere\nare often similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-self-referral and insurance laws that apply to state-funded Medicaid\nand other health care programs and private third-party payers. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act can be used\nto prosecute companies in the U.S. for arrangements with physicians, or other parties outside the U.S. if the physician or party\nis a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country. Enforcement of these regulations\nhas become increasingly stringent, particularly due to more prevalent use of the whistleblower provisions under the False Claims\nAct, which allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted\na false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery. If a governmental authority were to conclude that\nwe are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal\nand civil penalties and disbarment from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n10\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHealth\ncare fraud and false statement statutes, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing\nregulations (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d),\nalso prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health\ncare benefit program, including private payers, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material\nfact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or\npayment for health care benefits, items or services.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHIPAA,\nHITECH and Other Privacy Regulations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFederal\nand state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restrict the\nuse and disclosure of such information. HIPAA and HITECH set forth privacy and security standards that govern the use and disclosure\nof protected electronic health information by \u201ccovered entities,\u201d which include healthcare providers, health plans\nand healthcare clearinghouses. Because we provide our products directly to patients and bill third-party payers such as Medicare,\nMedicaid, and insurance companies, we are a \u201ccovered entity\u201d and must comply with these standards. Failure to comply\nwith HIPAA and HITECH or any state or foreign laws regarding personal data protection may result in significant fines or penalties\nand/or negative publicity. In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA and HITECH, some states have enacted privacy\nand security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA and HITECH. In those\ncases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws. If we\nfail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEnvironmental\nLaws\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nare subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the U.S. Like other medical device companies,\nour operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily manufacturing, sterilization, and disposal\nprocesses. We do not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our results of operations,\nfinancial position, or cash flows.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCybersecurity\nand Data Privacy\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProtecting\nthe privacy of customer and personnel information is important to us, and we maintain security protocols and processes, including\nongoing training and education for all personnel, designed to combat the risk of unauthorized access or inadvertent disclosure.\nOur business operations involve confidential information, including patient health information subject to regulation as discussed\nunder \u201c\nHIPAA, HITECH and Other Privacy Regulations\n\u201d above. Our information technology infrastructure is designed\nto offer reliability, scalability, performance, security and privacy for our personnel, clients, and third-party contractors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nmaintain comprehensive compliance and security programs designed to help safeguard and ensure the integrity of the confidential\ninformation we possess, which includes both organizational and technical control measures. We also have programs in place to monitor\nthe safety of confidential information as well as plans for immediate, coordinated action in the event of a potential security\nincident. We routinely conduct employee trainings on important information security procedures and engage with independent third-party\nfirms to test and measure compliance on these security measures. In addition, we have maintained appropriate cyber insurance policies\nthat limit the financial risk of any potential incident. Our cyber insurance policies include dedicated support for remediating\na specific cybersecurity or data privacy incident and limit the potential financial risk associated with an actual incident.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven\nthough we have implemented administrative, physical, and technical safeguards designed to help protect the confidential data we\npossess and the integrity of our information systems and infrastructure, these safeguards may not be effective in preventing future\ncybersecurity incidents or data breaches.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n11\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHuman\nCapital\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nbelieve that our dedicated, talented employees are our most valuable resource and a key strength in accomplishing our collective\nmission and goals. As of June 30, 2023, we had 170 employees, an increase of 9% from fiscal 2022, who are in 30 states throughout\nthe United States. 18 of our employees were respiratory therapists licensed by appropriate state professional organizations. We\nalso had approximately 170 respiratory therapists and health care professionals retained on a non-exclusive, independent contractor\nbasis to provide training to our customers in the U.S. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.\nWe believe our relations with our employees are good.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nare committed to attracting, retaining, and developing diverse and high-performing talent that includes a strong focus on performance\nand development, total rewards, diversity, inclusion and equity, and employee safety. These serve as the pillars to our human\ncapital management framework.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nunderstand that our success and growth depend on attracting, retaining, and developing talent across all levels of the organization.\nOur recruitment strategies are continuously reviewed with leadership and partners to ensure our practices align with our mission,\npurpose, and values.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nbelieve in ensuring that employees understand our mission, purpose, and goals as well as their impact on our success. We use an\nannual performance review process to support development and performance discussions with employees. In addition, every employee\nis eligible to participate in our incentive plan, which allows for us to share the rewards of the company with the people who\nsignificantly contribute to our success.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo\ncultivate a learning culture that provides enhancement and growth for our people, we offer educational assistance, online training,\nseminars, specific skill training, and participation in business and industry organizations. We are also committed to contributing\nour talents and resources to serve the communities in which we live and work through various charitable campaigns, employee programs\nand volunteerism. We believe that this commitment assists in our efforts to attract and retain employees.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nbelieve that sharing rewards is essential to increasing employee engagement and improving morale and creating a positive culture.\nWe also offer our employees a competitive salary and benefits package and are committed to continuous review of these programs.\nThese benefits include but are not limited to retirement savings, a variety of health insurance options and other benefits programs,\nincluding dental and vision, disability insurance, contributions to health savings accounts, paid maternity/paternity leave, and\nwellness resources. In addition, we offer opportunities for remote work and flexible schedules and location, depending on business\nneeds and the specific role.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nare committed to ensuring a diverse workforce in a safe environment by maintaining compliance with applicable employment laws\nand governmental regulations. Treating employees with dignity and equality is of utmost importance in everything we do. We take\npride in the fact that women represent 50% of our total managerial roles.. We pride ourselves on accepting, hearing, and celebrating\nmultiple approaches and points of view and building on an inclusive and diverse culture.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSafety\nis a vital aspect to the success of our people and business. We are proud of our employees\u2019 collective commitment to secure\nand maintain safe work practices that have resulted in zero lost time injuries within our manufacturing operations. We also provide\nwellbeing services to support each employee\u2019s physical and mental health and will continue to emphasize the importance of\nthe safety and health of our employees in all we do.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAvailable\nInformation\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur\nInternet address is www.smartvest.com.

The forward-looking statements\ninclude statements that reflect management\u2019s good faith beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations and\nintentions with respect to our future development plans, capital resources and requirements, results of operations, and future\nbusiness performance. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included\nin this discussion as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled \u201cInformation\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d immediately preceding Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nElectromed\ndevelops and provides innovative airway clearance products applying HFCWO technologies in pulmonary care for patients of all ages.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nmanufacture, market and sell products that provide HFCWO, including the SmartVest System that includes our newest generation SmartVest\nClearway\n\u00ae\n, previous generation SmartVest SQL\n\u00ae\n and related products, to patients with compromised\npulmonary function. The SmartVest Clearway is an updated and modern approach to HFCWO focused on an enhanced patient experience\nand proven patient outcomes. The product delivers effective 360\no\n oscillatory pressure through our proprietary rapid\ninflate-deflate technology which improves the patient\u2019s ability to breathe deeply during therapy. SmartVest Clearway is\nthe smallest, and lightest generator on the market, and is designed with an intuitive touchscreen to simplify programing and everyday\nuse. Our products are sold in both the home health care market and the institutional market for use by patients in hospitals,\nwhich we refer to as \u201cinstitutional sales.\u201d The SmartVest SQL has been sold in the domestic home care market since\n2014. In 2015, we launched the SmartVest SQL into institutional and certain international markets. In June 2017, we announced\nthe launch of the SmartVest SQL with SmartVest Connect\u2122 wireless technology, which allows data connection between physicians\nand patients to track therapy performance and collaborate in treatment decisions. In 2022, we launched the SmartVest Clearway\nwith SmartVest Connect technology to adult pulmonary, pediatric and cystic fibrosis patients for use in the home. We have marketed\nthe SmartVest System and its predecessor products since 2000 to patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis and repeated\nepisodes of pneumonia. Additionally, we offer our products to a patient population that includes neuromuscular disorders such\nas cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophies, ALS, and patients with post-surgical complications or who are ventilator dependent or\nhave other conditions involving excess secretion and impaired mucus transport.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nSmartVest System is often eligible for reimbursement from major private insurance providers, health maintenance organizations\n(\u201cHMOs\u201d), state Medicaid systems, and the federal Medicare system, which we believe is an important consideration\nfor patients considering an HFCWO course of therapy. For domestic sales, the SmartVest System may be reimbursed under the Medicare-assigned\nbilling code (E0483) for HFCWO devices if the patient has cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis (including chronic bronchitis or COPD\nthat has resulted in a diagnosis of bronchiectasis), or any one of certain enumerated neuromuscular diseases, and can demonstrate\nthat another less expensive physical or mechanical treatment did not adequately mobilize retained secretions. Private payers consider\na variety of sources, including Medicare, as guidelines in setting their coverage policies and payment amounts.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n14\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nemploy a direct-to-patient and provider model, through which we obtain patient referrals from clinicians, manage insurance claims\non behalf of our patients and their clinicians, deliver our solutions to patients and train them on proper use in their homes.\nThis model allows us to directly approach patients and clinicians, whereby we disintermediate the traditional durable medical\nequipment channel and capture both the manufacturer and distributor margins. We have engaged a limited number of regional durable\nmedical equipment distributors focused on respiratory therapies as an alternate sales channel. Revenue through this channel was\n3% of our total revenues in fiscal 2023.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur\nkey growth strategies for fiscal 2024 are to accelerate our revenue growth by taking market share and expanding the addressable\npopulation for the largest and fastest growing segments of the market: adult pulmonology/bronchiectasis. Actions to support accelerating\nour growth include the following:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nExpand\n                                         our sales force in targets geographies with high potential, adding an additional five\n                                         territories and direct sales reps;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nIncrease\n                                         Electromed brand awareness through direct-to-consumer and physician marketing, and peer\n                                         to peer education;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nProvide\n                                         best-in-class customer care and support; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nDevelop\n                                         and promulgate the body of bronchiectasis clinical evidence to increase physician adoption\n                                         of the SmartVest System for patients. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nImpacts\nof COVID-19 on Our Business and Operations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn\nMarch 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices designated COVID-19 as a public health emergency (\u201cPHE\u201d). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S.\nfederal government\u2019s declaration of a PHE, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) implemented\nseveral temporary rule changes and waivers to allow prescribers to best treat patients during the period of the PHE. These waivers\nbecame effective on March 1, 2020. Clinical indications and documentation typically required were not enforced for respiratory-related\nproducts, including the SmartVest System (solely with respect to Medicare patients).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn\nJanuary 30, 2023, the Biden administration announced that the COVID-19 national and PHE declarations will end on May 11, 2023.\nThe CMS waiver was not extended and expired on May 11, 2023. We believe that we were able to mitigate the potential effects on\nour net revenue resulting from the expiration of the CMS waiver by hiring additional employees to increase capacity and minimize\nthe average timeframe to convert a Medicare patient referral to approval and re-educating clinicians on Medicare requirements\nfor reimbursement of HFCWO.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\ndid not receive any direct financial assistance from any government program during fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2023 in connection with\nCOVID-19 relief measures.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nImpacts\nof Certain Macro-Economic Conditions and the Supply Chain on Our Business and Operations \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nobserved increased lead times for certain components in our supply chain and increased material costs and shipping rates during\nthe second half of fiscal 2022 and all of fiscal 2023. The changes to our supply chain lead times resulted in a temporary interruption\nthat impacted product availability for certain customers beginning in September 2022 and continuing through June 2023. We anticipate\nthat these increased lead times and temporary interruption of supply have the potential to continue through the first half of\nfiscal 2024. If we are unable to procure components to meet our demand or if we extend delivery lead-times to our customers, there\nmay be an adverse impact to our revenue and, longer term, the potential of market share losses. We are taking actions to expedite\ncomponents and to identify and qualify alternate suppliers for certain components to minimize any impact to our revenue and customer\ndeliveries. We expect that material costs and shipping rates will remain elevated during the first half of fiscal 2024 relating\nto supply chain availability and inflationary trends in electronic components and may extend to other components. In certain instances,\nwe have purchased key electronic materials in advance to ensure adequate future supply and mitigate the risk of potential supply\nchain disruptions. It is possible that these macro-economic conditions could have a greater adverse impact on our supply chain\nin the future, including impacts associated with preventative and precautionary measures taken by other businesses and applicable\ngovernments. A reduction or further interruption in any of our manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on\nour business. Any significant increases to our raw material or shipping costs could reduce our gross margins.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n15\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCritical\nAccounting Estimates\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDuring\nthe preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make estimates, assumptions and judgment that affect reported\namounts. Those estimates and assumptions affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, our disclosure of contingent assets\nand liabilities, and our reported revenues and expenses. We update these estimates, assumptions, and judgment as appropriate.\nSome of our accounting policies and estimates require us to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions\nfor calculating financial statements. Such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Among other factors, these\njudgments are based upon our historical experience, known trends in our industry, terms of existing contracts and other information\nfrom outside sources, as appropriate. The following is a summary of our primary critical accounting policies and estimates. See\nalso Note 1 to the Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRevenue\nRecognition\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRevenue\nis measured based on consideration specified in the contract with a customer, adjusted for any applicable estimates of variable\nconsideration and other factors affecting the transaction price, including consideration paid or payable to customers and significant\nfinancing components. Revenue from all customers is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control\nof a distinct good or service to a customer.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIndividual\npromised goods and services in a contract are considered a performance obligation and accounted for separately if the individual\ngood or service is distinct (i.e., the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources that are\nreadily available to the customer and the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the arrangement).\nIf an arrangement includes multiple performance obligations, the consideration is allocated between the performance obligations\nin proportion to their estimated standalone selling price, unless discounts or variable consideration is attributable to one or\nmore but not all the performance obligations. Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period incurred, unless\ncriteria for capitalization of costs under Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 340-40, \u201cOther Assets and\nDeferred Costs,\u201d or the requirements under other applicable accounting guidance are met.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nCompany includes shipping and handling fees in net revenues. Shipping and handling costs associated with the shipment of the Company\u2019s\nSmartVest System after control has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost\nof revenues.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nrequest that customers return previously sold units that are no longer in use to us to limit the possibility that such units would\nbe resold by unauthorized parties or used by individuals without a prescription. The customer is under no obligation to return\nthe product; however, we do reclaim the majority of previously sold units upon the discontinuance of patient usage. We are certified\nto recondition and resell returned SmartVest System units. Returned units are typically reconditioned and resold and continue\nto be used for demonstration equipment and warranty replacement parts.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInventory\nValuation\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInventories\nare stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Work in process and finished goods are carried\nat standard cost, which approximates actual cost, and includes materials, labor and allocated overhead. The reserve for obsolescence\nis determined by analyzing the inventory on hand and comparing it to expected future sales. Estimated inventory to be returned\nis based on how many devices that have shipped that are expected to be returned prior to completion of the insurance reimbursement\nprocess.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n16\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWarranty\nReserve\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nCompany provides a lifetime warranty on its products to the prescribed patient for sales within the U.S. and a three-year warranty\nfor all institutional sales and sales to individuals outside the U.S. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under\nits warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the product is shipped. Factors that affect the Company\u2019s\nwarranty reserve include the number of units shipped, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, the product\u2019s\nuseful life and cost per claim. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty reserve and adjusts the\namounts as necessary.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShare-Based\nCompensation\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShare-based\npayment awards consist of options to purchase shares of our common stock issued to employees. Expense for share-based payment\nawards consist of options to purchase shares of our common stock issued to employees for services. Expense for options is estimated\nusing the Black-Scholes pricing model at the date of grant and expense for restricted stock is determined by the closing price\non the day the grant is made. Expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service or vesting period of the\naward, or at the time services are provided for non-employee awards. In determining the fair value of options, we make various\nassumptions using the Black-Scholes pricing model, including expected risk-free interest rate, stock price volatility, and life.\nSee Note 8 to the Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of these\nassumptions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n17\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResults\nof Operations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFiscal\nYear Ended June 30, 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRevenue\nfor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 are summarized in the table below.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nFiscal\n    Years Ended June 30,\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2023\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2022\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nIncrease\n    (Decrease)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHome Care Revenue\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n43,945,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n38,004,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n5,941,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n15.6\n%\n\n\n\n\nInstitutional Revenue\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n2,080,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n1,660,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n420,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n25.3\n%\n\n\n\n\nHome Care Distributor Revenue\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n1,618,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n1,474,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n144,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n9.8\n%\n\n\n\n\nInternational Revenue\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n424,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n521,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n(97,000\n)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n(18.6\n%)\n\n\n\n\nTotal Revenue\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n48,067,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n41,659,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n6,408,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n15.4\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHome\nCare Revenue.\n Home care revenue increased by $5,941,000, or 15.6%, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The revenue increase\ncompared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to increases in referrals and approvals. The increase in referrals was primarily due\nto an increase in direct sales representatives, increased sales representative productivity driven by increased clinic access\nand patient flow, our sales team refining their selling process and clinic targeting methodology, and benefits of the CMS waiver\non the non-commercial Medicare portion of our home care revenue. Additionally, we benefitted from a Medicare allowable rate increase\nthat took effect on January 1, 2023. Annual Medicare rate increases for our device are linked closely to changes in the Urban\nConsumer Price Index.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nCMS waiver benefited the non-commercial Medicare portion of our home care revenue by increasing the number of referrals and the\napproval percentage for previously non-covered diagnoses. We believe that our ongoing sales team execution, along with the return\nto pre-COVID-19 levels of patient face-to-face engagement with physicians and clinic access for our sales team mitigated the fourth\nquarter homecare revenue impact of the CMS waiver expiration on May 11, 2023.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInstitutional\nRevenue.\n Institutional revenue increased by $420,000, or 25.3%, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Institutional revenue\nincludes sales to group purchasing organizations, rental companies and other institutions. The revenue increase was due to increased\ncapital purchases and stronger consumable volumes compared to fiscal 2022, as hospitals resumed utilization of HFCWO protocols\nafter reducing utilization early in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHome\nCare Distributor Revenue.\n Home care distributor revenue increased by $144,000, or 9.8%, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal\n2022. The revenue increase in fiscal 2023 was due to increased demand from one of our primary home care distribution partners.\nWe began selling to a limited number of home medical equipment distributors during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, who in\nturn sell our SmartVest System in the U.S. home care market.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInternational\nRevenue.\n International revenue decreased by $97,000, or 18.6%, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. International revenue\ngrowth is not currently a primary focus for us, and our corporate resources are focused on supporting and maintaining our current\ninternational distributors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGross\nProfit \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGross\nprofit increased to $36,519,000 in fiscal 2023, or 76.0% of net revenues, from $31,442,000 or 75.5% of net revenues, in fiscal\n2022. The increase in gross profit was primarily related to increases in domestic home care revenue including the Medicare allowable\nrate increase that took effect in January 2023.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n18\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nhave a goal of improving our gross margin percentage over time due to cost savings initiatives associated with Clearway, supplier\noptimization, and gaining operating leverage on higher volumes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOperating\nExpenses \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSelling,\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses.\n Selling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expenses were $31,595,000\nin fiscal 2023, representing an increase of $4,481,000 or 16.5% from $27,114,000 in fiscal 2022.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSG&A\npayroll and compensation-related expenses including health insurance benefits and other compensation increased by $2,629,000,\nor 14.7%, to $20,552,000 in fiscal 2023, compared to $17,923,000 in fiscal 2022. The increase in the current year was primarily\ndue to a higher average number of sales, sales support and marketing personnel, increased reimbursement personnel to process higher\npatient referrals, increased temporary resources to assist with systems infrastructure investments and increased incentive payments\non higher home care revenue. We have also continued to provide regular merit-based increases for our employees and are regularly\nbenchmarking our compensation ranges for new and existing employees to ensure we can hire and retain the talent needed to drive\ngrowth in our business. Field sales employees totaled 55, of which 46 were direct sales, as of June 30, 2023, compared to 52 as\nof June 30, 2022, of which 43 were direct sales. We expect to continue to expand our salesforce to align with our revenue growth\nprojections.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProfessional\nand legal fees, including recruiting and insurance expenses, increased by $859,000, or 19.4%, to $5,284,000 in fiscal 2023, compared\nto $4,425,000 in fiscal 2022. Professional fees include services related to legal costs, shareowner services and reporting requirements,\ninformation technology technical support and consulting fees. The increase in the current year was primarily due to an increased\ninvestment in our system infrastructure and increased clinical study costs. We continue to make key investments in systems infrastructure\nincluding implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, enhancing our customer relationship management system and further\noptimizing of the revenue cycle management system that was implemented in June 2021. We expect these system infrastructure investments\nwill result in more efficient and scalable operational processes and provide enhanced analytics to drive business performance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTotal\ndiscretionary marketing expenses increased by $211,000, or 25.6% to $1,035,000 in fiscal 2023, compared to $824,000 in fiscal\n2022. The increase in the current year was primarily due to discretionary investment in market research, physician marketing,\nand peer to peer education engagement strategies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTravel,\nmeals and entertainment expenses increased $422,000, or 16.4%, to $2,990,000 for fiscal 2023 compared to $2,568,000 in fiscal\n2022. The increase in the current year period was primarily due to an increase in headcount and our annual sales meeting expenses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResearch\nand Development Expenses \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nR&D\nexpenses decreased by $440,000, or 32.4%, to $916,000 in fiscal 2023 compared to $1,356,000 in fiscal 2022. The decrease in the\ncurrent year was primarily due to reduced professional consulting costs associated with our next generation platform development\nactivities. R&D expenses were 1.9% of revenue in fiscal 2023 compared to 3.3% of revenue in fiscal 2022. We expect R&D\nspending to be between 1.0% and 2.0% of revenue during fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInterest\nIncome, net\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet\ninterest income was approximately $78,000 in fiscal 2023 compared to net interest income of $25,000 in fiscal 2022. The increase\nin the current year was primarily due to higher interest rates earned on our cash deposits despite lower overall cash balances\nin the current year.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIncome\nTax Expense\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIncome\ntax expense in fiscal 2023 was $920,000, which includes a current tax expense of $963,000 and a deferred benefit of $43,000. Estimated\nincome tax expense includes a current federal and state tax benefit of approximately $250,000 related to the excess tax benefit\nfor fully vested stock options and non-qualified stock options that were exercised during the period.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n19\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIncome\ntax expense in fiscal 2022 was $692,000, which included a current tax expense of $1,181,000 and a deferred benefit of $489,000.\nEstimated income tax expense included a current federal and state tax benefit of approximately $12,000 related to excess tax benefit\nfor fully vested stock options and non-qualified stock options that were exercised during the period.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\neffective tax rates were 22.5% and 23.1% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory\nfederal rate because of state income taxes, R&D tax credits, and other permanent items that are non-deductible for tax purposes\nrelative to the amount of taxable income.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet\nIncome\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet\nincome for fiscal 2023 was $3,166,000, compared to net income of $2,305,000 in fiscal 2022. The increase in current year net income\nwas primarily due to stronger home care and distributor revenue growth.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLiquidity\nand Capital Resources\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCash\nFlows and Sources of Liquidity\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCash\nFlows from Operating Activities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023 was $1,315,000. Cash flows from operating activities consisted of net income of $3,166,000, non-cash expenses of approximately $1,278,000, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $202,000 an increase in tax payable of approximately $285,000 and a $696,000 increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and accrued compensation. These cash flows from operating activities were offset by a $3,078,000 increase in accounts receivable, an increase in inventory of $1,033,000, and a $201,000 increase in contract assets. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in the Medicare portion of our home care business, which has a 13-month payment cycle.  The increase in inventory was primarily due to an increase in raw materials associated with the launch of Clearway. Our cash receipt collection remains strong, with the three months ended June 30, 2023, period having the highest cash receipt collections in our company's history, building upon the prior record that was set in the previous quarter.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCash\nFlows from Investing Activities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet\ncash used in investing activities in fiscal 2023 was approximately $1,716,000. Cash used in investing activities consisted of\napproximately $1,648,000 in expenditures for property and equipment, approximately $1,083,000 for software and $565,000 for equipment,\nand $68,000 in payments for patent and trademark costs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCash\nFlows from Financing Activities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet\ncash used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 was approximately $380,000, consisting of $153,000 used for our share repurchase\nprogram and $310,000 for taxes paid on net share settlements of stock option exercises offset by $83,000 of cash provided by the\nissuance of common stock upon exercise of options.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdequacy\nof Capital Resources\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur\nprimary working capital requirements relate to adding employees to our sales force and support functions, continuing infrastructure\ninvestments, and supporting general corporate needs, including financing equipment purchases and other capital expenditures incurred\nin the ordinary course of business. Based on our current operational performance, we believe our working capital of approximately\n$29,734,000 and available borrowings under our existing credit facility will provide adequate liquidity for fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEffective\nDecember 17, 2021, we renewed our credit facility, which provides us with a revolving line of credit. Interest on borrowings on\nthe line of credit accrues at the prime rate (8.25% as of June 30, 2023) less 1.0% and is payable monthly. There was no outstanding\nprincipal balance on the line of credit as of June 30, 2023 or June 30, 2022. The amount eligible for borrowing on the line of\ncredit is limited to the lesser of $2,500,000 or 57.0% of eligible accounts receivable, and the line of credit expires on December\n18, 2023, if not renewed. As of June 30, 2023, the maximum $2,500,000 was available under the line of credit. Payment obligations\nunder the line of credit are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n20\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\ndocuments governing our line of credit contain certain financial and nonfinancial covenants that include a minimum tangible net\nworth of not less than $10,125,000 and restrictions on our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness or pay dividends.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny\nfailure to comply with these covenants in the future may result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result\nin the lender accelerating the maturity of our indebtedness, preventing access to additional funds under the line of credit, requiring\nprepayment of outstanding indebtedness, or refusing to renew the line of credit. If the maturity of the indebtedness is accelerated\nor the line of credit is not renewed, sufficient cash resources to satisfy the debt obligations may not be available and we may\nnot be able to continue operations as planned. If we are unable to repay such indebtedness, the lender could foreclose on these\nassets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDuring\nfiscal 2023 and 2022, we spent approximately $1,648,000 and $1,425,000, respectively, on property and equipment. We currently\nexpect to finance planned equipment purchases with cash flows from operations or borrowings under our credit facility. We may\nneed to incur additional debt if we have an unforeseen need for additional capital equipment or if our operating performance does\nnot generate adequate cash flows.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile\nthe impact of macroeconomic conditions and other factors such as inflation are difficult to predict, we believe our cash, cash\nequivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, operational cash\nrequirements for fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccounting\nStandards Recently Issued But Not Yet Adopted by the Company \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSee\nNote 1 of the Notes to our Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on new accounting standards\nadopted in fiscal 2023 or pending adoption.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nItem\n                                         7A.\nQuantitative\n                                         and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs\na smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide disclosure pursuant to this item.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n21\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\n                          8.\nFinancial\n                                        Statements and Supplementary Data.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIndex\nto Financial Statements\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n\nF-2\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance Sheets\n\n\nF-4\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatements of Operations\n\n\nF-5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatements of Shareholders\u2019 Equity\n\n\nF-6\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatements of Cash Flows\n\n\nF-7\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes to Financial Statements\n\n\nF-8\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0F-\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nReport\nof Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShareholders\nand Board of Directors\n\n\nElectromed,\nInc.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOpinion\non the Financial Statements\n\n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Electromed, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBasis\nfor Opinion\n\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCritical\nAudit Matter\n\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMeasurement\nof Customer Revenue Net of Adjustments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, revenues are recognized at a point in time when control passes to the customer upon product shipment or delivery. Net patient revenues (patient revenue less estimated adjustments) are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts from third-party payers and customers in exchange for the product. The Company has agreements with third-party payers that provide for payments at amounts different from its established rates. Each quarter, the Company estimates its adjustments for each sale based on the terms of third-party payer contracts and historical collections experience, then applies an estimate for an adjustment reserve percentage to the gross accounts receivable balances. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe identified the measurement of the adjustment reserve related to customer revenue as a critical audit matter due to

of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\n \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNature\nof business:\n Electromed, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) develops, manufactures and markets innovative airway clearance products\nthat apply High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (\u201cHFCWO\u201d) therapy in pulmonary care for patients of all ages. The\nCompany markets its products in the U.S. to the home health care and institutional markets for use by patients in personal residences,\nhospitals and clinics. The Company also sells internationally both directly and through distributors. International sales were\n$\n424,000\n and $\n521,000\n for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 (\u201cfiscal 2023\u201d) and June 30, 2022 (\u201cfiscal 2022\u201d),\nrespectively. Since its inception, the Company has operated in a single industry segment: developing, manufacturing, and marketing\nmedical equipment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nImpacts\nof COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s business\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nCompany did not receive any direct financial assistance from any government program during fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2023 in connection\nwith COVID-19 relief measures.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. federal government\u2019s declaration of a public health emergency, the Centers\nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) implemented a number of temporary rule changes and waivers to allow prescribers\nto best treat patients during the period of the public health emergency. These waivers were made retroactively effective to March\n1, 2020 and were in place for the duration of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022 and through May 11, 2023. Clinical indications and documentation\ntypically required were not enforced for respiratory related products including the Company\u2019s SmartVest\u00ae Airway Clearance\nSystem (\u201cSmartVest System\u201d) (solely with respect to direct Medicare covered patients) applicable for the Company\u2019s\nhome care prescriptions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\npotential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our operational and financial performance will depend in large part\non future developments, which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA\nsummary of the Company\u2019s significant accounting policies follows:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUse\nof estimates\n:\n Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Actual results could\nvary from the estimates that were used. The Company believes the critical accounting policies that require the most significant\nassumptions and judgments in the preparation of its financial statements include revenue recognition and the related estimation\nof variable consideration, inventory valuation, share-based compensation and warranty reserve.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nRevenue\nrecognition\n:\n Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in the contract with a customer, adjusted for any applicable\nestimates of variable consideration and other factors affecting the transaction price, including noncash consideration, consideration\npaid or payable to customers and significant financing components. Revenue from all customers is recognized when a performance\nobligation is satisfied by transferring control of a distinct good or service to a customer. See Note 2 for information on revenue.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShipping\nand handling expense\n:\n Shipping and handling charges incurred by the Company are included in cost of revenues and were $\n896,000\n\nand $\n982,000\n for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCash\nand cash equivalents\n:\n Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in bank deposits and money market funds with original maturities\nof three months or less at the time of purchase. The Company has not experienced any losses in these accounts.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccounts\nreceivable\n:\n The Company\u2019s accounts receivable balance is comprised of amounts due from individuals, institutions and\ndistributors. Balances due from individuals are typically remitted to the Company by third-party reimbursement agencies such as\nMedicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies. Accounts receivable are carried at amounts estimated to be received from patients\nunder reimbursement arrangements with third-party payers. Accounts receivable are also net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.\nManagement determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering\na customer\u2019s financial condition and credit history. Receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of\nreceivables previously written off are recorded when received. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $\n45,000\n as of June 30,\n2023 and 2022.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0F-\n8\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nContract\nassets\n: \nContract assets include amounts recognized as revenue that are estimates of variable consideration for Medicare appeals\nwhere the final determination of the insurance coverage amount is dependent on future approval of an appeal, or when the consideration\ndue to the Company is dependent on a future event such as the patient meeting a deductible prior to the Company\u2019s claim\nbeing processed by the payer. Contract assets are classified as current as amounts will turn into accounts receivable and be collected\nduring the Company\u2019s normal business operating cycle. Contract assets are reclassified to accounts receivable when the right\nto receive payment is unconditional.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInventories\n:\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Work in process and finished\ngoods are carried at standard cost, which approximates actual cost, and includes materials, labor and allocated overhead. Standard\ncosts are reviewed at least quarterly by management, or more often in the event circumstances indicate a change in cost has occurred.\nThe reserve for obsolescence is determined by analyzing the inventory on hand and comparing it to expected future sales. Estimated\ninventory to be returned is based on how many devices that have shipped that are expected to be returned prior to completion of\nthe insurance reimbursement process.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProperty\nand equipment\n:\n Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of\ntheir estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term. The Company retains ownership of demonstration equipment in the possession\nof both inside and outside sales representatives, who use the equipment in the sales process.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLeases\n:\n\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Where an arrangement is a lease, the Company determines\nif it is an operating lease or a finance lease. At lease commencement, the Company records a lease liability and corresponding\nright of use ROU asset. Lease liabilities represent the present value of our future lease payments over the expected lease term,\nwhich includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain those options will be exercised. The present\nvalue of the Company\u2019s lease liability is determined using its incremental collateralized borrowing rate at lease inception.\nROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to control the use of the leased assets during the lease and are recognized in\nan amount equal to the lease liability for leases with an initial term greater than 12 months. Over the lease term (operating\nleases only), the Company uses the effective interest rate method to account for the lease liability as lease payments are made\nand the ROU asset is amortized to consolidated statement of operations in a manner that results in straight line expense recognition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinite-life\nintangible assets\n:\n Finite-life intangible assets include patents and trademarks. These intangible assets are amortized on\na straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as described in Note 5.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLong-lived\nassets\n:\n Long-lived assets, primarily property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. In\nevaluating recoverability, the following factors, among others, are considered: a significant change in the circumstances used\nto determine the amortization period, an adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, a transition to a new product\nor service strategy, a significant change in customer base, and a realization of failed marketing efforts. The recoverability\nof an asset or asset group is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf\nthe Company believes the carrying value is unrecoverable, then it recognizes an impairment charge necessary to reduce the unamortized\nbalance to the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. The amount of such impairment is charged to operations in the\ncurrent period.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWarranty\nliability\n:\n The Company provides a lifetime warranty on its products to the prescribed patient for sales within the U.S. and\na three-year warranty for all institutional sales and sales to individuals outside the U.S. The Company estimates the costs that\nmay be incurred under its warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the product is shipped or delivered.\nFactors that affect the Company\u2019s warranty liability include the number of units shipped, historical and anticipated rates\nof warranty claims, the product\u2019s useful life, and cost per claim. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its\nrecorded warranty liability and adjusts the amounts as necessary.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0F-\n9\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChanges\nin the Company\u2019s warranty liability were as follows:\n\n\n\u00a0\nSchedule of changes in warranty liability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nYears\n    Ended June 30,\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2023\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2022\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBeginning warranty reserve\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n1,256,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n940,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAccrual for products sold\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n416,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n494,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nExpenditures and costs incurred for warranty claims\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n(\n294,000\n)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n(\n178,000\n)\n\n\n\n\nEnding warranty reserve\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n1,378,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n1,256,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIncome\ntaxes\n:\n Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary\ndifferences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary\ndifferences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.\nDeferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some\nportion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company reverses a valuation allowance if it determines, based\non the weight of all available evidence, including when cumulative losses become positive income, that it is more likely than\nnot that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects\nof changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nCompany recognizes tax liabilities when the Company believes that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by\ntax authorities. Benefits from tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely\nof being realized upon settlement. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded,\nsuch differences impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. Interest and penalties, if any,\nrelated to accrued liabilities for potential tax assessments are included in income tax expense.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResearch\nand development\n:\n Research and development costs include costs of research activities as well as engineering and technical\nefforts required to develop new products or make improvements to existing products. Research and development costs are expensed\nas incurred.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvertising\ncosts\n:\n Advertising costs are charged to expense when incurred. Advertising, marketing and trade show costs for fiscal 2023\nand 2022 were $\n1,244,000\n and $\n936,000\n, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShare-based\npayments\n:\n Share-based payment awards consist of options to purchase shares of common stock and restricted shares of common\nstock issued to employees for services. Expense for options is estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model at the date of\ngrant and expense for restricted stock is determined by the closing price on the day the grant is made. Expense is recognized\non a graded vesting basis over the requisite service or vesting period of the award, or at the time services are provided for\nnon-employee awards.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFair\nvalue of financial instruments\n:\n The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and\naccrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet\nincome per common share\n:\n Net income is presented on a per share basis for both basic and diluted common shares. Basic net\nincome per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding\nany restricted stock awards which have not vested. The diluted net income per common share calculation includes outstanding restricted\nstock grants and assumes that all stock options were exercised and converted into shares of common stock at the beginning of the\nperiod unless their effect is anti-dilutive. Common stock equivalents included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share\nwere \n237,149\n and \n297,383\n shares for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Common stock equivalents excluded from the calculation\nof diluted earnings per share because their impact was anti-dilutive were \n194,154\n and \n113,646\n shares for fiscal 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0F-\n10\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRecently\nIssued Accounting Standards\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn\nJune 2016, the Financial Accounting Board issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13,\u00a0Financial Instruments\n-- Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u00a0which was subsequently amended by ASU 2018-19, ASU\n2019-04, 2019-05, 2019-10, 2019-11, and 2020-02. The standard introduces new accounting guidance for credit losses on financial\ninstruments within its scope, including trade receivables. This new guidance adds an impairment model that is based on expected\nlosses rather than incurred losses. It is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022,\nwith early adoption permitted. Adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNote\u00a02.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRevenues\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRevenue\nis measured based on consideration specified in the contract with a customer, adjusted for any applicable estimates of variable\nconsideration and other factors affecting the transaction price, including consideration paid or payable from customers and significant\nfinancing components. Revenue from all customers is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control\nof a distinct good or service to a customer, as further described below under \nPerformance obligations and transaction price\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIndividual\npromised goods and services in a contract are considered a performance obligation and accounted for separately if the individual\ngood or service is distinct (i.e., the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources that are\nreadily available to the customer and the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the arrangement).\nIf an arrangement includes multiple performance obligations, the consideration is allocated between the performance obligations\nin proportion to their estimated standalone selling price, unless discounts or variable consideration is attributable to one or\nmore but not all the performance obligations. Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period incurred, unless\ncriteria for capitalization of costs under Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 340-40, \u201cOther Assets and\nDeferred Costs\u201d (\u201cASC 340\u201d), or other applicable guidance are met.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nCompany includes shipping and handling fees in net revenues. Shipping and handling costs associated with the shipment of the SmartVest\nSystem after control\u00a0has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of revenues\nin the Statements of Operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\ntiming of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in accounts receivable on the Balance Sheets as further described\nbelow under \nAccounts receivable \nand \nContract assets\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDisaggregation\nof revenues. \nIn the following table, revenue is disaggregated by market:\n\n\n\u00a0\nSchedule of disaggregated revenue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nYears\n    Ended June 30,\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2023\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2022\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHome care\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n43,945,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n38,004,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nInstitutional\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n2,080,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n1,660,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHome care distributor\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n1,618,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n1,474,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nInternational\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n424,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n521,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n48,067,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n41,659,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0F-\n11\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn\nthe following table, home care revenue is disaggregated by payer type:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nYears\n    Ended June 30,\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2023\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2022\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nCommercial\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n18,481,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n14,937,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMedicare\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n18,682,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n16,692,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMedicare Supplemental\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n5,000,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n4,484,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMedicaid\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n941,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n1,028,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n841,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n863,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n43,945,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n38,004,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRevenues\nin the Company\u2019s home care, home care distributor and international markets are recognized at a point in time when control\npasses to the customer upon product shipment or delivery. Revenues in the Company\u2019s institutional market include sales recognized\nat a point in time upon shipment or delivery.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPerformance\nobligations and transaction price. \nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service\nto the customer and is the unit of account under ASC 606, \u201cRevenue From Contracts With Customers\u201d (\u201cASC 606\u201d).\nA contract\u2019s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation in proportion to the standalone selling\nprice for each and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company\u2019s performance\nobligations and the timing or method of revenue recognition in each of the Company\u2019s markets are discussed below:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHome\ncare market\n.\n In the Company\u2019s home care market, its customers are patients who use the SmartVest System. The various\nmodels of the SmartVest System are comprised of three main components - a generator, a vest and a connecting hose - that are sold\ntogether as an integrated unit. Accordingly, in contracts within the home care market, the Company regards the SmartVest System\nto be a single performance obligation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nCompany makes available to its home care patients limited post-sale services that are not material in the context of the contracts,\neither individually or taken together, and therefore does not consider them to be performance obligations. The costs associated\nwith the services are accrued and expensed when the related revenues are recognized. As such, transactions in the home care market\nconsist of a single performance obligation: the SmartVest System.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHome\ncare patients generally will rely on third-party payers, including commercial payers and governmental payers such as Medicare,\nMedicaid and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of the SmartVest System. The\nthird-party payers\u2019 reimbursement programs fall into three types, distinguished by the differences in the timing of payments\nfrom the payer, consisting of either (i) outright sale, in which payment is received from the payer based on standard terms, (ii)\ncapped installment sale, under which the SmartVest System is sold for a series of payments that are capped not to exceed a prescribed\nor negotiated amount over a period of time or (iii) installment sale, under which the SmartVest System is paid for over a period\nof several months as long as the patient continues to use the SmartVest System.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRegardless\nof the type of transaction, provided criteria for an enforceable contract are met, it is the Company\u2019s long-standing business\npractice to regard all home care agreements as transferring control to the patient upon shipment or delivery, in spite of possible\npayment cancellation under government or commercial programs where the payer is controlling the payment over specified time periods.\nFor home care sales that feature installment payments, the ultimate amount of consideration received from Medicare, Medicaid or\ncommercial payers can be significantly less than expected if the contract is terminated due to changes in the patient\u2019s\nstatus, including insurance coverage, hospitalization, death or otherwise becoming unable to use the SmartVest System. However,\nonce delivered to a patient who needs the SmartVest System, the patient is under no obligation to return the SmartVest System\nshould payments be terminated as a result of the described contingencies. As a result, the Company\u2019s product sales qualify\nfor point in time revenue recognition. Control transfers to the patient, and revenue is recognized, upon shipment or delivery\nof the SmartVest System. At this point, physical possession and the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred\nto the patient and either a current or future right to payment is triggered, as further discussed under \nAccounts receivable\n\nand \nContract assets \nbelow.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0F-\n12\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nCompany\u2019s contractually stated transaction prices in the home care market are generally set by the terms of the contracts\nnegotiated with insurance companies or by government programs. The transaction price for the Company\u2019s products may be further\nimpacted by variable consideration. ASC 606 requires the Company to adjust the transaction price at contract inception and throughout\nthe contract duration for the estimated value of payments to be received from insurance payers based on historical experience\nand other available information, subject to the constraint on estimates of variable consideration. Transactions requiring estimates\nof variable consideration primarily include (i) capped installment payments, which are subject to the third-party payer\u2019s\ntermination due to changes in insurance coverage, death or the patient\u2019s discontinued use of the SmartVest System, (ii)\ncontracts under appeal and (iii) patient responsibility amounts for deductibles, coinsurance, copays and other similar payments.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough\nestimates may be made on a contract-by-contract basis, whenever possible, the Company uses all available information including\nhistorical collection patterns to estimate variable consideration for portfolios of contracts. The Company\u2019s estimates of\nvariable consideration consist of amounts it may receive from insurance providers in excess of its initial revenue estimate due\nto patients meeting deductibles or coinsurance during the payment duration, changes to a patient\u2019s insurance status, changes\nin an insurance allowable, claims in appeals with Medicare and amounts received directly from patients for their allowable or\ncoinsurance. The Company believes it has representative historical information to estimate the amount of variable consideration\nin relevant portfolios considering the significant experience it has with each portfolio and the similarity of patient accounts\nwithin a portfolio. The analysis includes steps to ensure that revenue recognized on a portfolio basis does not result in a material\ndifference when compared with an individual contract approach. The Company also leverages its historical experience and all available\nrelevant information for each portfolio of contracts to minimize the risk its estimates used to arrive at the transaction price\nwill result in a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized when the uncertainty associated with the\nvariable consideration is subsequently resolved. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company\u2019s\njudgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor\ncontracts in which the Company believes the criteria for reimbursement under government or commercial payer contracts have been\nmet but for which coverage is unconfirmed or payments are under appeal, the Company has significant observable evidence of relatively\nconsistent claims recovery experience over the prior three to five years. The Company believes the low volatility in historical\nclaims approval rates for populations of patients whose demographics are similar to those of current patients provides reliable\npredictive value in arriving at estimates of variable consideration in such contracts. Similarly, historical payment trends for\nrecovery of claims subject to payer installments and payments from patients have remained relatively consistent over the past\nfive years. No significant changes in patient demographics or other relevant factors have occurred that would limit the predictive\nvalue of such payment trends in estimating variable consideration for current contracts. As a result, the Company believes its\nestimates of variable consideration are generally not subject to the risk of significant revenue reversal.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor\neach type of variable consideration discussed above, there are a large number of contracts with similar characteristics with a\nwide range of possible transaction prices. For that reason, the Company uses the probability-weighted expected value method provided\nunder ASC 606 to estimate variable consideration.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nCompany often receives payment from third-party payers for the SmartVest System sales over a period of time that may exceed one\nyear. Despite these extended payment terms, no significant financing component is deemed to exist because the purpose of such\nterms is not to provide financing to the patient, the payer or the Company. Rather, the extended payment terms are mandated by\nthe government or commercial insurance programs, the fundamental purpose of which is to avoid paying the full purchase price of\nequipment that may potentially be used by the patient for only a short period of time.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHome\ncare distributors. \n Sales to distributors, who sell direct to patients, are made at fixed contract prices and may include\ntiered pricing structures or volume-based rebates which offer more favorable pricing once certain volumes are achieved per the\nnegotiated contract. The distributor\u2019s purchases accumulate to give the distributor a right to a higher discount on purchases\nin excess of the specified level within the contract period. As a result, to the extent the Company expects the distributor to\nexceed the specified volume of purchases in the annual period, it recognizes revenue at a blended rate based on estimated total\nannual volume and sales revenue. This effectively defers a portion of the transaction price on initial purchases below the specified\nvolumes for recognition when the higher discount is earned on purchases in excess of specified volumes. Transfer of control of\nthe products occurs upon shipment or delivery to the distributor as applicable.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0F-\n13\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInstitutional\nmarket. \nThe Company\u2019s institutional sales are made to hospitals and home health care centers, pulmonary rehabilitation\ncenters and other clinics. Sales to these institutions are negotiated with the individual institution or with group purchasing\norganizations, with payments received directly from the institution. No insurance reimbursement is involved. Generators are either\nsold or leased to the institutions and associated hoses and wraps (used in institutional settings rather than vests) are sold\nseparately. Accordingly, each product is distinct and considered a separate performance obligation in sales to institutional customers.\nThe agreements with institutions fall into two main types, distinguished by differences in the timing of transfer of control and\ntiming of payments:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nOutright\n                                         sale \u2013 Under these transactions, the Company sells its products for a prescribed\n                                         or negotiated price. Transfer of control of the product, and associated revenue recognition,\n                                         occurs at the time of shipment and payment is made within normal credit terms, usually\n                                         within 30 days.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nWrap\n                                         usage agreements \u2013 Under these transactions, the Company provides a generator device\n                                         at no cost to the hospital in return for a fixed annual commitment to purchase consumable\n                                         wraps. These agreements are cancellable upon at least sixty days prior written notice\n                                         by either party. If cancelled, the generator is returned to the Company, where it can\n                                         be refurbished and used again at a later date. Revenue for the consumable wraps is recognized\n                                         when control transfers to the customer.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInternational\nmarket. \n Sales to international markets are made directly to a number of independent distributors at fixed contract prices\nthat are not subject to further adjustments for variable consideration. Transfer of control of the products occurs upon shipment\nor delivery to the distributor as applicable.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProduct\nwarranty. \nThe Company offers warranties on its products. These warranties are assurance type warranties not sold on a standalone\nbasis or are otherwise considered immaterial in the context of the contract, and therefore are not considered distinct performance\nobligations under ASC 606. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranties and records a liability in\nthe amount of such costs at the time the product is sold.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccounts\nreceivable. \nThe Company\u2019s accounts receivable balance is comprised of amounts\u00a0due from individuals, institutions\nand distributors. Balances due from individuals are typically remitted to the Company by third-party reimbursement agencies such\nas Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies. Accounts receivable are carried at amounts estimated to be received from\npatients under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payers. Accounts receivable are also net of an allowance for doubtful\naccounts. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and\nconsidering a customer\u2019s financial condition and credit history. Receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nContract\nassets. \nContract assets include amounts recognized as revenue that are estimates of variable consideration for Medicare appeals\nwhere the final determination of the insurance coverage amount is dependent on future approval of an appeal, or when the consideration\ndue to the Company is dependent on a future event such as the patient meeting a deductible prior to the Company\u2019s claim\nbeing processed by the payer. Contract assets are classified as current as amounts is expected to turn into accounts receivable\nand be collected during the Company\u2019s normal business operating cycle. Contract assets are reclassified to accounts receivable\nwhen the right to receive payment is unconditional.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nContract\nbalances. \nThe following table provides information about

Options expire\nten years from the grant date and vest over a period of three years. In November 2017, the Company\u2019s shareholders approved\nthe 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the \u201c2017 Plan\u201d) which superseded the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2014\nPlan\u201d). The 2017 Plan allows the Board to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock\nunits and other stock-based awards, as well as cash incentive awards to all employees, non-employee directors, and advisors or\nconsultants of the Company. The vesting schedule and term for each award are determined by the Board upon each grant. Upon vesting,\nand the Company\u2019s determination that any necessary conditions precedent to the exercise of shares (such as satisfaction\nof tax withholding and compliance with applicable legal requirements) have been satisfied, shares purchased are delivered to the\nparticipant in a manner prescribed or permitted by the Board. The maximum number of shares of common stock available for issuance\nunder the 2017 Plan is \n900,000\n. There were \n163,500\n options granted under the 2014 Plan and prior plans outstanding as of June\n30, 2023. There were \n288,070\n options issued under the 2017 Plan outstanding and \n291,245\n shares available for grant under the 2017\nPlan as of June 30, 2023.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nCompany recognizes compensation expense related to share-based payment transactions in the financial statements based on the estimated\nfair value of the award issued. The fair value of each option is estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model at the time of\naward grant. The Company estimates the expected life of options based on the expected holding period by the option holder.

These leases have payments\nranging from $\n200\n to $\n5,300\n per month which expire through December 2025 and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nlife of the lease. All leases are classified as operating leases which do not include renewal options. The Company currently does\nnot have any variable lease costs. The Company elected the practical expedient\nto calculate the present value of the fixed payments without having to perform an allocation to lease and non-lease components.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nCompany has recognized right of use assets associated with its operating leases of $161,000 and $120,000\n as of June 30, 2023 and\nJune 30, 2022, respectively, which is included in other assets on the Company\u2019s balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities were\n$\n161,000\n\n\nand $\n120,000\n\n\nas of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively, which are included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities\non the Company\u2019s balance sheet.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs\nof June 30, 2023, the Company has a weighted-average lease term of \n1.5\n years for its operating leases, which have a weighted-average\ndiscount rate of \n4.0\n%.Operating lease payments of $\n82,000\n\nare included in operating cash flows in fiscal 2023. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMaturities\nof lease liabilities, which are included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Balance Sheet, are\nas follows:\n\n\n\u00a0\nSchedule of maturities of lease liabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nFiscal years ending June 30:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n80,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n80,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2026\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n8,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2027\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2028\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTotal lease payments\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n168,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Less: Interest\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n(\n7,000\n)\n\n\n\n\nPresent value of lease liabilities\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n161,000\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNote\n11.\n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCommitments and Contingencies\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLitigation:\n\nThe Company is occasionally involved in claims and disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company insures\ncertain business risks where possible to mitigate the financial impact of individual claims and establishes reserves for an estimate\nof any probable cost of settlement or other disposition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn\nSeptember 8, 2021, a state court putative class action lawsuit was filed in Minnesota against the Company asserting injury resulting\nfrom the previously announced data breach that impacted the Company\u2019s customer protected health information and employee\npersonal information and seeking compensatory damages, equitable relief, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On October 6, 2021,\nthe proceeding was removed to the District of Minnesota. The Company believes the plaintiff was not injured as a result of the\ndata privacy incident and, as a result, the claims are without merit. Accordingly, on November 11, 2021, the Company moved to\ndismiss the complaint in its entirety. Prior to the hearing on the motion to dismiss, the parties agreed in principle to settle\nthe case. The parties have executed a settlement agreement and submitted a motion to settle the class action. During January 2023,\nthe settlement was preliminarily approved. The hearing for final approval took place on June 5, 2023. Following the final approval\nhearing, the court issued a judgment on July 10, 2023 granting a motion for final approval of the settlement. As a result of the\njudgement, there was no additional impact on the financial statements as of or for the year ended June 30, 2023.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0F-\n20\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n401(k)\nProfit Sharing Plan:\n The Company has an employee benefit plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code covering all\nemployees who are \n21\n years of age or older. The Company matches each employee\u2019s salary reduction contribution, not to exceed\nfour percent of annual compensation. Total employer contributions to this plan for fiscal 2023 and 2022 were $\n524,000\n and $\n461,000\n,\nrespectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmployment\nAgreements: \nThe Company has entered into formal employment agreements with its President and Chief Executive Officer and its\nChief Financial Officer, as may be amended from time to time. These agreements provide these officers with, among other things,\ntwelve and eighteen months, respectively, of base salary upon a termination without \u201cCause\u201d or in the event the employee\nresigns for \u201cGood Reason\u201d or within twelve months of a \u201cChange in Control,\u201d as such terms are defined\nin the respective employment agreements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNote\n12.\n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRelated Parties\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nCompany uses a parts supplier whose founder and president was a director of the Company through November 12, 2021. The Company\nmade payments to the supplier of $\n1,857,000\n and $\n360,000\n during fiscal year 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur\nmanagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is\ndefined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process\ndesigned by, or under the supervision of, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, and effected\nby our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\nand includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1)\nPertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions\nof our assets;\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(2)\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization\nof our management and directors; and\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(3)\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause\nof its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of preventing and detecting\nmisstatements on a timely basis. It is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, the risk\nthat misstatements are not prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining\nadequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur\nmanagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework\nset forth in the report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding\ninternal control over financial reporting. Management\u2019s report was not subject to attestation by the Company\u2019s independent\nregistered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that exempt smaller reporting companies from the auditor attestation\nrequirement.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChanges\nin Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere\nwere no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nItem\n                          9B.\nOther Information.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNone.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n22\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nItem\n                          9C.\nDisclosure\n                                         Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNot\napplicable.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPART\nIII\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCertain\ninformation required by Part III is incorporated by reference from our definitive Proxy Statement for the Fiscal 2024 Annual Meeting\nof Shareholders (the \u201cProxy Statement\u201d).
