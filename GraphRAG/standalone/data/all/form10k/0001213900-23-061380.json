BUSINESS.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur Company is a content-driven\nand technology-enabled shopping destination for appliances, furniture and home goods.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur goal is to give\ncustomers a wide array of choices and a premium experience through detail on the best brands, volume purchasing, and rebates with\nmanufacturer discounts, supported by human customer service agents.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCorporate History and Structure\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur Company was incorporated in the State of\nDelaware on January 10, 2019, to form an acquisition platform. In April 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets of\nGoedeker Television, a brick and mortar operation with an online presence serving the St. Louis metro area. Since that acquisition,\nwe have grown into a nationwide omnichannel retailer. Through our June 2021 acquisition of Appliances Connection, we have evolved\ninto a growth-oriented e-commerce platform, offering an expansive selection of household appliances throughout the United States. In\nJuly 2021, we added to our platform by acquiring Appliances Gallery. On July 20, 2022, we changed our corporate name from 1847\nGoedeker Inc. to Polished.com Inc. With warehouse fulfillment centers in the Northeast and Midwest, as well as showrooms in\nBrooklyn, New York, Largo, Florida and St. Louis, Missouri, we offer one-stop shopping for national and global brands. We carry many\nhousehold name-brands, including Bosch, Cafe, Frigidaire Pro, Whirlpool, LG, and Samsung, and many major luxury appliance brands\nsuch as Miele, Thermador, La Cornue, Dacor, Ilve, Jenn-Air and Viking, among others. We also sell furniture, fitness equipment,\nplumbing fixtures, televisions, outdoor appliances, and patio furniture, as well as commercial appliances for builder and business\nclients.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKey Acquisitions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAcquisition of Goedeker Television\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn April 5, 2019, we acquired substantially all\nof the assets of Goedeker Television (the \u201cGoedeker Television Acquisition\u201d). As a result of this transaction, we acquired\nthe former business of Goedeker Television, which was founded in 1951, and continue to operate this business. Prior to the Goedeker Television\nAcquisition, we had no operations other than operations relating to our incorporation and organization.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAcquisition of Appliances Connection\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAppliances Connection was founded in 1998 and\nis one of the leading retailers of household appliances. In addition to selling appliances, it also sells furniture, fitness equipment,\nplumbing fixtures, televisions, outdoor appliances, and patio furniture, as well as commercial-grade appliances for builder and business\nclients. It also provides appliance installation services and appliance removal services. Appliances Connection serves retail customers,\nbuilders, architects, interior designers, restaurants, schools and other businesses. We completed the acquisition of Appliances Connection\non June 2, 2021, for an aggregate purchase price of $224.7 million, consisting of (i) $180.0 million in cash, (ii) 5,895,973 shares of\nthe Company\u2019s common stock valued at $12.3 million, and (iii) $32.4 million as a result of the post-closing net working capital\nadjustment provision (such acquisition, the \u201cAppliances Connection Acquisition\u201d). We recorded $0.9 million in acquisition-related expenses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAcquisition of AC Gallery\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn July 29, 2021, we acquired substantially all\nof the assets of, and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of, Appliance Gallery, Inc., a retail appliance store in Largo, Florida\n(\u201cAppliance Gallery\u201d), for a total purchase price of $1.4 million (such acquisition, the \u201cAppliance Gallery Acquisition\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nName Change\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn July 20, 2022, we changed our corporate name from 1847\nGoedeker Inc. to Polished.com Inc., pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation\n(the \u201cCertificate of Amendment\u201d) filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on July 20, 2022 (the \u201cName\nChange\u201d). Pursuant to Delaware law, a shareholder vote was not necessary to effectuate the Name Change and the Name Change\ndoes not affect the rights of the Company\u2019s stockholders. The only change in the Certificate of Amendment was the change of\nthe Company\u2019s corporate name. We also amended and restated our Bylaws on July 20, 2022 to reflect the Name Change and to make\nother minor cleanup and conforming changes thereto.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn connection with the Name Change, our common\nstock and warrants to purchase common stock ceased trading under the ticker symbols \u201cGOED\u201d and \u201cGOED WS,\u201d respectively,\nand began trading on the NYSE American under the new ticker symbols \u201cPOL\u201d and \u201cPOL WS,\u201d respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvestigation\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn August 15, 2022, the Company filed a Form 12b-25\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its 10-Q for the six months ended June 30, 2022 reporting that the Audit Committee\nhad begun an independent investigation regarding certain allegations made by certain former employees related to the Company\u2019s business\noperations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn December 22, 2022, the Company issued a press release stating that\nthe Board had completed its assessment of the results of the Audit Committee\u2019s previously disclosed investigation. The investigation,\nwhich was supported by independent legal counsel and advisors, produced the following key findings pertaining to the Company\u2019s business\noperations under former management during the 2021-2022 period:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\nThe Company was charged by its former Chief Executive Officer approximately $800,000 for expenses unrelated to the Company and its operations.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\nThe Company appears to not have had in place all the necessary documentation for all of its employees and, in turn, may have failed to comply with certain legal requirements. The Company subsequently put in place enhanced controls to remedy any labor issues, including but not limited to hiring a controller with significant relevant experience, hiring a new human resources director who is leading an overhaul of certain employee policies and initiating the installation of enhanced payroll software that requires all new employees to provide I-9 information and verifies the validity of key information, and believes it is now in full compliance with legal requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s controls, software and procedures for managing and tracking inventory, including damaged inventory, were insufficient. The Company subsequently put in place enhanced controls to remedy such issues, including but not limited to initiating the installation of enhanced software and systems for inventory management, ensuring the implementation of standardized policies for the handling and sale of damaged inventory and developing a plan to convert the Company to a new ERP and system for accounting.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company entered into a settlement agreement\nwith Albert Fouerti, our former Chief Executive Officer, regarding matters relating to the investigation. Among other things, Mr. Fouerti\nagreed not to compete for a period of two years following the execution of the settlement agreement.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nResignation of Auditors\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn December 20, 2022, the Company received a letter (the \u201cLetter\u201d)\nfrom the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Friedman LLP (\u201cFriedman\u201d), informing the Company of\nits decision to resign effective December 20, 2022 as the auditors of the Company.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the Letter, Friedman advised the Company that\nbased on the results of the Board\u2019s internal investigation as reported to Friedman, it appeared there may be material adjustments\nand/or disclosures necessary to previously reported financial information. Additionally, the Board\u2019s internal investigation identified\nfacts, that if further investigated by Friedman, might cause Friedman to no longer to be able to rely on the representations of (i) management\nthat was in place at the time Friedman issued its audit report for the year ended December 31, 2021, or (ii) management that was in place\nat the time of Friedman\u2019s association with the quarterly financial statements for the periods ended June 30, 2021, September 30,\n2021 and March 31, 2022. Prior to the Letter, in the past two years, the Company had not received from Friedman an adverse opinion or\na disclaimer of opinion, and Friedman\u2019s opinion was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.\nThe resignation by Friedman was neither recommended nor approved by the Audit Committee or the Board and there were no disagreements with\nmanagement and Friedman. Friedman had previously reported a material weakness to the Audit Committee, which was included on the Company\u2019s\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed on March 31, 2022, regarding the ineffectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrols over financial reporting.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn connection with the Letter, Friedman advised\nthe Company that it was withdrawing its previously issued audit opinion on our December 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements, issued\non March 31, 2022, and declined to be associated with the quarterly financial statements for the periods ended June 30, 2021, September\n30, 2021, and March 31, 2022, filed on August 8, 2021, November 16, 2021 and May 12, 2022, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEngagement of New Independent Registered\nPublic Accounting Firm\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn December 26, 2022, the Audit Committee approved\nthe engagement of Sadler, Gibb & Associates, LLC (\u201cSadler\u201d) as the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting\nfirm for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCybersecurity Incident\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn March 16, 2023, we experienced a hacking attack\nthat impacted the check-out page on the Company\u2019s e-commerce website. In response, the Company deployed containment measures, launched\nan investigation with assistance from third-party cybersecurity experts and notified appropriate law enforcement authorities. The Company\nconsiders the matter remediated. The investigation determined that certain personal information, including names, addresses, zip codes,\npayment card numbers, expiration dates, and CVVs, was extracted from the Company\u2019s systems as part of this incident. The investigation\ncould not determine with precision which payment card data was included in the timeframe of exposure. Out of an abundance of caution,\nthe Company notified all payment card users who made transactions on the Company\u2019s e-commerce website within the window of exposure.\nAs of May 24, 2023, the Company provided appropriate notice to approximately 9,290 individuals, as well as to regulatory authorities in\naccordance with applicable law. The Company has incurred, and may continue to incur, certain expenses related to this attack. Further,\nthe Company remains subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the incident, including as a result of the data that was extracted\nfrom the Company\u2019s network as noted above. Additionally, security and privacy incidents have led to, and may continue to lead to,\nadditional regulatory scrutiny. Although we are unable to predict the full impact of this incident, including how it could negatively\nimpact our operations or results of operations on an ongoing basis, we presently do not expect that it will have a material effect on\nthe Company\u2019s operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company has engaged outside consultants through\nits outside counsel to help assess and expand the Company\u2019s cyber defenses and payment card protections and policies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCredit Agreement Amendment\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn July 2023, the Company\u2019s lender amended\nthe credit agreement to waive defaults on the May 9, 2022 credit agreement. The amendment establishes a new EBITDA covenant and requires\nthe Company to maintain minimum liquidity of $8 million including restricted cash and $3 million excluding restricted cash. Liquidity\nas defined in the credit agreement amendment includes cash and certain qualifying customer accounts receivable. The credit agreement amendment\nrequires the Company to pay the existing loan by August 31, 2024. The Company has begun discussions with investment bankers to place financing\nto replace the existing credit agreement by August 31, 2024.

According to Statista, revenue in the U.S. major household appliances market (excluding small appliances)\nis projected to reach $23.2 billion in 2022 and grow at an annual growth rate of 3.08% from 2022 to 2026.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are\napproximately 76 million households in the United States with annual incomes over $25,000 aged between 25 and 65 years, many of whom are\naccustomed to purchasing goods online. As younger generations age, start new families and move into new homes, we expect online sales\nof household appliances to increase. In addition, we believe the online household appliances market will further grow as older generations\nof consumers become increasingly comfortable purchasing online, particularly if the process is easy and efficient.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur\nProducts\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe sell a vast assortment of household appliances,\nincluding refrigerators, ranges, ovens, dishwashers, microwaves, freezers, washers and dryers. In addition to appliances, we also offer\na broad assortment of products in the furniture, d\u00e9cor, bed & bath, lighting, outdoor living, electronics categories, fitness\nequipment, plumbing fixtures, air conditioners, fireplaces, fans, dehumidifiers, humidifiers, air purifiers and televisions. While these\nare not individually high-volume categories, they complement the appliance to produce a one-stop home goods offering for customers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nVendor/Supplier Relationships\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe offer more than 400 vendors and over 500,000\nSKUs available for purchase through our website. We believe that this depth of vendor relationships gives consumers numerous options in\nall product categories resulting in a true one-stop shopping destination. Our principal vendors and suppliers are Dynamic Marketing Inc\n(a buying coop), Frigidaire, General Electric, LG, Whirlpool, Bosch, Viking, Miele, Samsung, Fisher Paykel and Ilve.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a member and 1.6% equity interest holder\nof Dynamic Marketing, Inc. (\u201cDMI\u201d), a 60-member appliance purchasing cooperative. DMI purchases consumer electronics and appliances\nat wholesale prices from various vendors, and then makes such products available to its members, who sell such products to end consumers.\nDMI\u2019s purchasing group arrangement provides its members with leverage and purchasing power with appliance vendors, and increases\nour ability to compete with competitors, including big box appliance and electronics retailers. For the years ended December 31, 2022\nand 2021, the Company purchased a substantial portion of finished goods from DMI, representing 69% and 72% of purchases, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, Dynamic\nMarketing Inc accounted for approximately 69% of our purchases; no other vendor accounted for more than 10% of our purchases during the\nsame period.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business model allows us to constantly review\nand evaluate each supplier relationship, and we are open to building new supplier/vendor relationships. Products are purchased from all\nsuppliers on an at-will basis. Relationships with suppliers are subject to change from time to time. Please see Item 1A \u201c\nRisk\nFactors\n\u201d for a description of the risks related to our supplier relationships.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMarketing\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur marketing efforts drive new and repeat customers\nand promote our websites as online communities relating to major appliances and other products. Our strategy is to inspire the customer\nat each point of their shopping journey, delivering curated messaging, content and advice in an effort to increase engagement and repeat\npurchasing. We utilize a combination of paid and earned media, including search engine marketing, email, digital display, social media,\nretargeting, radio and events, in our media strategy. We also have programs to engage appliance enthusiasts and build community through\ndesign and customer portals that are intended both to inspire and provide help the business-to-business (\u201cB2B\u201d) and business-to-consumer\n(\u201cB2C\u201d) customers with their projects.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCustomers and Markets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have physical stores and warehouses located in Brooklyn, New York,\nSomerset, New Jersey, Hamilton, New Jersey, St. Charles, Missouri and Largo, Florida. Our internal logistics network and third-party distribution,\ndelivery and installation agreements allow us to serve, sell and ship to customers nationwide. The diagram below represents our sales\nby region for 2022:\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLogistics\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn our fulfillment of large durable goods, we have\ncreated an infrastructure that allows us to deliver products in most states. We want to scale this infrastructure by continuing to improve\nexecution, fulfillment center locations, and delivery timing. This proprietary logistic process enables us to provide our customers\u2019\nproducts quickly and to provide a better shipping and delivery experience than they might otherwise experience. Additionally, we believe\nthis logistics network will help us reduce expenses, touchpoints, damages and returns.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are continuing to build out our custom-built,\nproprietary technology and operational platform to deliver the best experience for both our customers and suppliers. Our success has been\nbuilt on a culture of data-driven decision-making and proprietary software for order management and customer fulfillment. We believe that\ncontrol of our technology systems, which gives us the ability to update them often, is a competitive advantage. Our team of engineers\nhas built a technology solution for durable goods. Our software consists of a large set of tools and systems with which our customers\ndirectly interact, that are specifically tuned for shopping the major appliance category by mixing lifestyle imagery with easy-to-use\nnavigation tools and personalization features designed to increase customer conversion. We have designed operations software to deliver\nthe reliable and consistent experience consumers desire, with proprietary software enhancing our performance in areas such as integration\nwith our suppliers, our warehouse and logistics network and our customer service operation. Much of our customer marketing technology\nwas internally developed, including campaign management and bidding algorithms for online advertising. This allows us to leverage our\ninternal data and target customers efficiently across various channels. We also partner with select marketing and trade partners where\nwe find solutions that meet our marketing objectives and inspire our B2B and B2C customers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCompetition\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile we are primarily focused on the online U.S.\nappliances, furniture and other home goods market, we compete across all segments of the market. Our competition includes online retailers\nand marketplaces, furniture stores, big box retailers, department stores and specialty retailers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCompetitive Strengths\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe U.S. appliance market is\nhighly fragmented, with thousands of local and regional retailers competing for a share. We believe this fragmented market presents an\nopportunity to streamline business and make brands and products available to everyone across the country. We are standardizing a consistent\nend-to-end experience to provide products to the consumer no matter where they are located in the country.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are strengthening our e-commerce\nplatform and increasing our showroom and distribution center model to provide a smooth path to purchase. We are also investing in our\nbrand presence and marketing efforts to drive customer acquisition and engagement. Our goal is to be the appliance destination for our\ncustomers from inspiration to installation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur competitive strengths include:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nName and reputation\n. In 2022, we introduced our Polished name and continue to build off our\n                                                                                       Goedeker legacy in offering competitively priced name-brand products and services, which has been recognized over 50+ years in the\n                                                                                       business.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nProduct selection and pricing\n.

We focus on the needs\nand experience of customers, whether they are in the market for a replacement, renovation or new construction project. This customer-centric\napproach is evidenced by our repeat customers, over-indexing the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nHighly trained and professional staff\n. Our team is\ntrained to educate and support customers when selecting and buying products. A large percentage of customer orders involve a phone conversation\nwith a sales team member\u2014a differentiator when competing with online-only companies as well as brick-and-mortar outlets.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nWebsite ease of use\n. Our proprietary, purpose-built\ntechnology platform is designed to provide consumers a compelling user experience as they browse, research and purchase our products.\nWe use personalization, based on past browsing and shopping patterns, to create a more engaging consumer interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nProprietary technology and content\n. Investments in\nour technology platform create a scalable process and support the customer at every point in the journey, including call center tools,\ndigital marketing optimization, B2B design portals, product reviews and lifestyle content.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGrowth Strategies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur mission is to change the way consumers buy appliances\nand, in doing so, become the leading online retailer of home appliances. The strategies of the Company to achieve this mission, while\nincreasing value for our stockholders, will include:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\nRebrand the combined company. \nWe plan to drive brand awareness through strategic omni-channel marketing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\nStrengthening\n    the Company\u2019s Leadership Team. \u00a0\nWe have made significant executive and senior management hires and are continuing to\n    build our talent pool and hire highly-skilled employees. Recruiting top-tier talent at all levels remains a priority, especially as\n    the Company evolves and grows.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\nSecure design and builder trade business. \nWe have created new tools and benefits to engage and simplify appliance shopping and buying for B2B projects with builders, contractors, architects and interior designers who are making or influencing the purchasing decision for their clients.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\nCategory expansion and Deeper Connectivity with Customers. \nWe will be adding new, complementary categories and services to our selection to meet our customers\u2019 ever-changing needs.

We have identified the geographic areas in which we want to establish a presence to reach more\n    customers and further penetrate markets that are experiencing high levels of housing development and home remodeling. Although we\n    currently are holding off on entering into agreements due to inventory and supply chain issues, we expect to add at least two new\n    fulfillment centers over the next year. We believe that adding fulfillment centers in other parts of the country will\n    minimize product touchpoints and damage, as well as expedite delivery. With access to vendor warehouse operations, we expect to\n    capitalize on buying opportunities and capture time-sensitive customers more frequently.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\no\nPrice optimization\n. We are building a data-based understanding of price elasticity dynamics, promotional\nstrategies and other price management tools to drive optimized pricing for our products.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIntellectual Property\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe own several registered domain names, including\nfor our \nwww.polished.com\n website and the Appliances Connection websites \nwww.appliancesconnection.com, 1stopcamera.com, goldcoastappliances.com,\nand joesappliances.com\n.

To further protect our intellectual property, we enter into confidentiality agreements with our executive officers and directors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, in an effort to protect\nour brand, we had three registered trademarks in the United States.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHuman Capital\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we employed 391 total\nemployees, all of which were full-time employees.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have not experienced any work stoppages and\nwe consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or\nrepresented by a labor union. Our people are integral to our business, and we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain\nqualified personnel.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGovernment Regulation\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business is subject to the laws of the U.S.\njurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions as to\nhow, or whether, laws governing personal privacy, data security, consumer protection or sales and other taxes, among others, apply to\nthe Internet and e-commerce. These laws are continually evolving. For example, certain applicable privacy laws and regulations require\nus to provide customers with our policies on sharing information with third parties, and advance notice of any changes to these policies.\nRelated laws may govern the manner in which we store or transfer sensitive information or impose obligations on us in the event of a security\nbreach or inadvertent disclosure of such information. Additionally, tax regulations in jurisdictions where we do not currently collect\nstate or local taxes may subject us to the obligation to collect and remit such taxes, or to additional taxes, or to requirements intended\nto assist jurisdictions with their tax collection efforts. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws from jurisdictions whose\nlaws do not currently apply to our business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and e-commerce generally\ncould result in significant additional taxes on our business. Further, we could be subject to fines or other payments for any past failures\nto comply with these requirements. The continued growth and demand for e-commerce is likely to result in more laws and regulations that\nimpose additional compliance burdens on e-commerce companies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting\nCompany\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d\nunder the JOBS Act and a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act. As a result, we are permitted\nto, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor so long as we are an emerging growth company,\nwe will not be required to:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nhave an auditor report on our internal controls over financial\nreporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\ncomply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional\ninformation about the audit and the consolidated financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nsubmit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder\nadvisory votes, such as \u201csay-on-pay\u201d and \u201csay-on-frequency;\u201d and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\ndisclose certain executive compensation related items such\nas the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer\u2019s compensation\nto median employee compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also\nprovides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities\nAct for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain\naccounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits\nof this extended transition period. Our consolidated financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply\nwith such new or revised accounting standards.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until\nthe earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (ii) the last day\nof the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues are $1.235 billion or more, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge\naccelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that\nis held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iv)\nthe date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may continue to qualify as a smaller reporting\ncompany if either (i) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue\nwas less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates\nis less than $700 million. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements, including,\nbut not limited to presenting only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nand reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditional Information About the Company\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following documents are available free of\ncharge through the Company\u2019s website, www.polished.com: the Company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form\n10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports that are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (\u201cSEC\u201d) pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).\nThese materials are made available through the Company\u2019s website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically\nfiled with, or furnished to, the SEC.
