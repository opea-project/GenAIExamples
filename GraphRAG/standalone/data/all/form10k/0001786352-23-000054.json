    "item1": ">Item 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nOur mission is to make it simple to connect and do business.\nWe are a leader in financial automation software for small and midsize businesses (SMBs). As a champion of SMBs, we are automating the future of finance so businesses can thrive. Hundreds of thousands of businesses rely on BILL to more efficiently control their payables, receivables, and spend and expense management. Our network connects millions of members so they can pay or get paid faster. Headquartered in San Jose, California, we are a trusted partner of leading U.S. financial institutions, accounting firms, and accounting software providers.\nBILL's purpose-built, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled financial software platform creates seamless connections between our customers, their suppliers, and their clients. Businesses use our platform to generate and process invoices, streamline approvals, make and receive payments, manage employee expenses, sync with their accounting systems, foster collaboration, and manage their cash. We have built sophisticated integrations with popular accounting software solutions, banks, card issuers, and payment processors, enabling our customers to access these mission-critical services quickly and easily. Divvy, a BILL company, provides a solution for businesses to have smart corporate cards, build budgets, manage payments, and eliminate the need for manual expense reports. \nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, more than 460,000 businesses used our solutions and processed $266\u00a0billion in Total Payment Volume (TPV) during fiscal 2023. As of June\u00a030, 2023, approximately 5.8 million network members have paid or received funds electronically using our platform.  See \u201c\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Key Business Metrics\n\u201d for definitions and a detailed discussion of our key business metrics.\nOur Solution\nOur platform automates the SMB back office and enables businesses using our solutions to pay their suppliers and collect payments from their clients, in effect acting as a system of control for their accounts payable, accounts receivable, and spend and expense management activities. As a result, our platform frees businesses using our solutions from cumbersome legacy financial processes and provides the following key benefits:\n\u2022\nAutomated and Efficient.\n Our AI-enabled platform helps businesses using our solutions pay their bills efficiently and get paid faster. We provide tools that streamline the transaction lifecycle by automating data capture and entry, routing bills for approval, and detecting duplicate invoices.\n\u2022\nIntegrated and Accurate.\n We provide an end-to-end platform that connects businesses using our solutions to their suppliers and clients. Our platform integrates with accounting software, banks, card issuers, and payment processors, enabling businesses using our solutions to access all of these mission-critical partners easily. Because we provide a comprehensive view, customers can more easily find inconsistencies and inaccuracies, and fix them quickly.\n\u2022\nDigital and Secure.\n We enable secure connections and storage of sensitive supplier and client information and documents, such as invoices and contracts, and make them accessible to authorized users on any device, from anywhere.\n\u2022\nVisible and Transparent.\n With our solutions, customers can easily view their transaction workflows, create budgets, and manage spend, enabling them to gain deeper insight into their financial operations, and manage their cash flows.\n3\nWhat Sets Us Apart\n\u2022\nPurpose-Built for SMBs.\n Our platform provides SMBs with core functionality and value-added services generally reserved for larger companies. Through our cloud-based desktop and mobile applications, SMBs can connect and do business from anywhere, any time. Our platform offers a variety of payment solutions which enhances the experience for both buyers and suppliers in a transaction.\n\u2022\nDiverse Distribution Channels.\n We leverage both direct and indirect channels - accounting firms, financial institution partners, and accounting software integrations - to efficiently go-to-market.\n\u2022\nLarge and Growing Network.\n As accounts receivable customers issue invoices, and accounts payable customers pay bills, they connect to their clients and suppliers, driving a powerful network effect. This aids our customer acquisition efforts by increasing the number of businesses connected to our platform, which then become prospects.\n\u2022\nLarge Data Asset.\n We have a large data asset as a result of processing millions of documents and billions of dollars in business payments annually for businesses using our solutions. By leveraging our machine learning capabilities, we generate insights from this data that drive product innovation.\n\u2022\nProprietary Risk Management Expertise.\n Leveraging our data, our proprietary risk engine has trained upon millions of business-to-business ACH, check, card, and wire transactions, enabling us to keep businesses using our solutions\u2019 funds secure.\n\u2022\nExperienced Management Team and Vibrant Culture.\n Our management team has deep experience with SMBs, software-as-a-service companies, AI, accounting firms, and financial institutions. We have built a unique culture that resonates with employees, as evidenced by our highly competitive, low attrition rates.\nOur Platform\n Our purpose-built platform leverages the fact that we can see both sides of a transaction and can easily connect both transaction parties and promote the rapid exchange of information and funds, with strong network effects and greater monetization opportunities as more customers adopt our platform. Our platform also expands the ability of businesses using our solutions to budget for, monitor, and approve employee expenses across organizations of all sizes, all in real-time. \nAccounts Payable Automation\nOur accounts payable automation service streamlines the entire payables process, from the receipt of a bill, through the approvals workflow, to the payment and synchronization with the accounting system. Here are some highlights of our service:\n\u2022\nVisibility at a glance \u2013 \nThrough our platform, businesses using our solutions gain a comprehensive view of their cash inflows and outflows.\n\u2022\nDocument management \u2013 \nBILL automatically assigns a dedicated email address to each customer to provide to its suppliers. Suppliers use that email address to send invoices to the customer\u2019s dedicated BILL inbox. Alternatively, scanned invoices can be uploaded directly through our application. Once uploaded, we store the bills securely, linking them to the associated supplier. With a single click, customers can use our search feature to scan documents quickly and resolve open questions. Our document management capabilities help businesses using our solutions make payment decisions, answer supplier questions, and provide support to accountants and auditors. \n\u2022\nIntelligent bill capture\n \u2013 We have automated the capture of data from bills by leveraging our proprietary AI capabilities. Incoming bills are machine-read, and critical data fields, including due date, amount, and supplier name, are prepopulated. The customer's Accounts Payable staff can review the result and make any adjustments required, and our platform routes the bill internally for approval.\n4\n\u2022\nDigital workflows and approvals\n \u2013 Our platform speeds approval processes through policy-driven workflows. Much of this activity takes place while people are on-the-go: one of the top three uses of our mobile app is bill approvals. Our platform proactively suggests payment dates based upon a bill\u2019s due date, helping customers avoid late payment penalty fees. Businesses using our solutions assign each user a role: administrator, payor, approver, clerk, or accountant. Each role has its own entitlements to ensure appropriate checks and balances in the back office.\n\u2022\nCollaboration and engagement\n \u2013 Our platform promotes collaboration. Our in-app messaging capabilities make communications between businesses using our solutions and their employees, vendors, and clients, easy. For example, BILL allows administrators and payors to remind approvers to act, or delegate payment authority when a key employee is unavailable. Our platform creates a clear audit trail that becomes invaluable in the event of an audit, or for tax compliance.\nAccounts Receivable Automation\nOur accounts receivable service automates the entire process, from the creation of an invoice and delivery to the client, to funds collection and synchronization back to the accounting system. Here are some highlights of our service:\n\u2022\nEasy invoicing\n \u2013 Using a simple template, customers can easily create electronic invoices on our platform and insert their own logos to customize them. If required, our platform also enables the printing and mailing of paper invoices. Many accounts receivable customers take advantage of our recurring invoice feature.\n\u2022\nDigital workflows and visibility\n \u2013 Our platform automates and simplifies electronic invoice creation, delivery, and collection of funds. Using our progress bar, customers have complete visibility into the accounts receivable process. When both trading partners are in the network, businesses using our solutions can see when their invoices are delivered, opened, authorized to be paid, and when payment was received. Invoices and supporting documents like contracts are readily accessible and notes can be entered for future reference. \n\u2022\nCollaboration and engagement\n \u2013 To make paying an invoice easy, we offer a customizable, branded client payment portal. Clients receive a link to an electronic invoice accessible on the Bill.com site. From this portal, the client can make a payment via ACH or credit card within seconds. For reference purposes, the client has ongoing access to bills and associated payments within the portal. Just like our accounts payable service, our in-app collaboration tools make communications between the accounts receivable customer and its clients easy and trackable.\nSpend and Expense Management\nWith Divvy, spending businesses gain robust spend and expense management tools, helping them spend smarter. Our spend and expense management product provides businesses full visibility into their spend, by giving businesses the ability to issue any employee their own Divvy card. Every card provides access to charge card lines originated through our card issuing partner banks (Issuing Banks) and is linked to proactive spend controls: managers control their budgets by team through the assignment of individual permissions. Employees can request funds from their phones, and budget owners or admins can approve or deny spend requests on-the-go from a push notification to their phone. Spending businesses can leverage a single, centralized budget or opt for a more sophisticated scenario, where budgets are established by department, team, or project. Rather than building a business budgeting strategy using outdated numbers in a static spreadsheet, our budgeting software syncs automatically with the employee's Mastercard or Visa cards, while also facilitating reimbursements and vendor spend. With Divvy\u2019s intuitive web and mobile applications, budget owners can drill down into spending by department, team, project, or individual. Whether on-the-go or in the office, an SMB can view up-to-date spend against budgets, so they always know where they stand.\nWe market Divvy cards to potential spending businesses and issue business-purpose charge cards through our partnerships with Issuing Banks. When a business applies for a Divvy card, we utilize, on behalf of the Issuing Bank, proprietary risk management capabilities to confirm the identity of the business, and perform a credit underwriting process to determine if the business is eligible for a Divvy card pursuant to our credit \n5\npolicies. Once approved for a Divvy card, the spending business is provided a credit limit and can use the Divvy software to request virtual cards or physical cards.\nPayment Services\nOur suite of comprehensive payment services includes:\n\u2022\nACH payments\n \u2013 We enable ACH transactions for both disbursements and collections. Our network makes it simple to make the switch from paper checks.\n\u2022\nCard payments\n \u2013 Through a third party, we offer businesses using our accounts receivable solutions the convenience of accepting credit and debit card payments. In addition, we enable virtual card payments to vendors of businesses using our account payable solutions and who have elected to accept card payments. Virtual cards support faster payments to suppliers, which includes the data needed to easily match incoming payments with open receivables. Through card issuing partners, Divvy provides both physical and virtual Mastercard and Visa cards to companies that enroll in its business spend and expense management program.\n\u2022\nReal-time payments\n \n(RTP)\n \u2013 Through The Clearing House\u2019s RTP\n\u00ae\n network, a real-time payments platform, we offer an instant transfer service to allow businesses using our solutions to disburse funds rapidly to meet urgent  funding needs. We also facilitate near real-time payments to customers\u2019 debit cards via a service offered with a partner.\n\u2022\nChecks\n \u2013 We issue checks if our customer prefers or is contractually obligated to pay via this method. By design, we protect our SMB customers against check fraud by never disclosing their bank account details to a supplier and by reviewing every check presented against a check issue file to detect and prevent check fraud.\n\u2022\nCross-border payments\n \u2013 We simplify cross-border disbursements by facilitating electronic funds transfers around the world with our International Payments service. Payments can be issued in either U.S. or foreign currency, and our platform synchronizes with customers\u2019 accounting software for a consolidated view of domestic and international outflows. We offer our U.S.-based customers the ability to disburse funds to over 130 countries worldwide.\n\u2022\nPay By Card\n \u2013  Our Pay By Card feature allows businesses using our solutions to make payments using a credit or debit card, even if the vendor or contractor does not accept card payments. We process the payment with the business' credit or debit card provider, then we pay the vendor or contractor via ACH ePayment or check depending on the business' preference.\n\u2022\nInvoice financing\n \u2013 We, through a partnership with a third party, enable businesses easier access to cash by allowing them to finance outstanding invoices. For a small origination fee, businesses using our solutions can receive cash immediately instead of waiting for their invoices to be paid. \nValue-Added Services\n\u2022\nTwo-way sync with leading accounting systems\n \u2013 Our platform automatically synchronizes customers, suppliers, general ledger accounts, and transactions with an SMB\u2019s accounting system to automate reconciliation. We are integrated with several of the most popular business accounting software applications, including QuickBooks, Oracle NetSuite, Sage Intacct, Xero, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Our two-way synchronization capabilities virtually eliminate double data-entry, as our platform and the customer\u2019s accounting software continuously keep each other updated. Customers who use other types of systems use our advanced file import/export capabilities to minimize data entry activities.\n\u2022\nPurchase order (PO) matching\n \u2013 We sync POs directly from accounting software systems, including Oracle NetSuite and Sage Intacct, and QuickBooks Desktop into our platform. Users can compare POs and invoices on one screen, then route bills for approval and payment seamlessly in the same workflow. This eliminates the need to switch between systems for two-way matching and reduces the back-and-forth communication between PO creators and accounts payable managers.\n6\n\u2022\nFrequent status updates\n \u2013 We provide timely status updates of financial inflows and outflows by providing status updates of all transactions on a regular basis. Through our workflow progress bars on each page, businesses using our solutions can see who has approved an invoice and what approvals remain, the status of each payment, and the date transactions are expected to clear.\n\u2022\nTreasury services\n \u2013 Our platform integrates advanced treasury services tools that are normally either not offered to or are costly for SMBs. Examples include:\n\u25e6\nthe positive pay feature we employ to ensure only authorized payment transactions are processed;\n\u25e6\na streamlined void and reissue function when an in-process payment needs to be cancelled; and\n\u25e6\nthe cleared check images we make available to enable businesses using our solutions to confirm payment receipt and facilitate research.\n\u2022\nCustom user roles\n \u2013 Our platform enables customers to define custom user roles. These roles can be used to expand or limit each user\u2019s access to the platform and core financial operations functions. For example, a customer can temporarily enable its auditors or tax preparers to access our platform using a custom role that allows them to view source documents in support of the services they are providing, but not have access to other confidential documents or information.\n\u2022\nDocument discovery\n \u2013 With our advanced document management capabilities, a customer can easily search for an uploaded document and search its data elements, regardless of how old it is, or how long it has been in our system. Businesses using our solutions utilize this feature when deciding whether to pay a given bill or re-issue an invoice, or in determining who authorized a certain payment. \n\u2022\nIntegrated, robust mobile functionality\n \u2013 Our mobile-native apps, available in both iOS and Android, are easy to adopt and use. Through our apps, businesses using our solutions can manage their transaction workflows, send an invoice, make payments on-the-go, and manage spend. \nPartner Integrations \nAccounting firms use our platform to provide financial automation, bill payment, and client advisory services, or \u201cCAS,\u201d to their clients. Our platform empowers accountants with a purpose-built console to collaborate with their staff and clients across multiple workflows enabling them to be more strategic and serve more clients.  \nWe provide our financial institution partners a technology platform that enables a white-label integration with their existing business banking services. We deliver single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, integrated provisioning, and entitlement of new accounts, as well as integration with required compliance systems. Transactions are synchronized automatically between the financial institution\u2019s platform and ours, keeping the customer\u2019s view current and consistent.\nIn addition to our white-labeled solution, we support a broad range of partners and customers with our platform application programming interfaces (APIs). These APIs allow our partners to integrate our platform seamlessly into their solutions, create web or mobile apps that integrate with ours, or leverage our payments capabilities. Through our APIs, developers can:\n\u2022\ninteract with business entities, like suppliers and clients;\n\u2022\nobtain summary-level reports, such as payables and receivables reports; and\n\u2022\ninteract with accounting details, such as the general ledger codes of the chart of accounts.\n7\nOur Unique Data Asset\nBILL's total payment volume and number of documents processed for businesses using our solutions provides us with a unique data asset. This asset has allowed us to build powerful AI capabilities. The data provides a view into customer transactions and operational status of various payment processes, which enables us not only to effectively manage risk exposure but also to provide businesses using our solutions with enhanced tools, such as automatically populating drafts of bills, to save time and simplify their operations. Our system continues to learn with each payment made and document processed. This virtuous cycle of learning powers a network effect that facilitates customer satisfaction, offers intelligent insights, improves trust and safety, and fuels further growth.\nOur Network\nThrough our AI-enabled platform, businesses using our solutions can easily connect with existing network members. The benefit of being in the network is simple: customers connect with others to pay and be paid electronically, freeing them from the need to solicit or share bank account and routing numbers with each trading partner individually. The process of adding bank account details to our platform is easy and secure. For example, when a supplier of an accounts payable customer receives an invitation to join our network, the supplier can accept and securely share its bank account details once with BILL. From that point onward, all payments to that supplier will be electronic.\nOnce in the network, other BILL customers can easily link to that same supplier without the supplier having to repeat this process again. This approach to connecting businesses has allowed us to build a robust and growing business-to-business payments directory, which includes approximately 5.8\u00a0million network members as of June\u00a030, 2023. We define network members as our BILL standalone customers plus their suppliers and clients, who have paid or received funds electronically via our platform. These network effects promote greater adoption of our platform, higher levels of engagement, and increased value across our ecosystem. \nPayment and Risk Management Services\nOur payments engine powers our payment services. Through dedicated connections with banks and payment processors, we issue checks, initiate card-based transactions, originate ACH-based payments, including real-time payments, through our instant transfer feature, and execute wire transfers. Our payments engine handles all aspects of payment file transfers, exception file handling, and required payment status reporting. We have redundancy across our core payment methods such that if there is an outage with one payment processor, we can direct payments to an alternative provider.\nThrough our risk engine, we use both proprietary and third-party tools to assess, detect, and mitigate financial risk associated with the payment volume that we process. Throughout the transaction lifecycle, we monitor data and payments to ensure that we are safeguarding our customers, their suppliers and clients, and our company. When a bank account is added to the platform, we validate that the bank account is held at a U.S.-domiciled financial institution, is associated with the organization adding the account, and is in good standing.\nWhen customers use our services, we monitor key activities looking for signals that would indicate anomalies that could create risk exposure and need to be investigated. Our risk engine analyzes many unique data elements to score transactions. Those that score above our thresholds are routed to trained risk agents for manual review. Agents have the latitude to contact customers to gather further information, or if a financial risk is imminent, to prevent funds from leaving our system until any suspicious activity can be resolved.\nOnce a payment transaction is processed, we continue to manage our exposure. We have extensive contacts in the banking industry, and we utilize these to reverse payments when possible. If a suspicious or fraudulent payment cannot be reversed, we follow a rigorous collections process to recover funds.\nThis risk management process gets progressively more insightful as our data set gets larger and our AI-enabled risk engine gets smarter. This is an advantage that we expect to continue to grow over time. Our success in managing the risk inherent in moving funds for business customers is proven. As a percentage of our \n8\nTPV, fraud and credit loss rates for our BILL standalone payment services were nominal, less than 0.01% for each of fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021. As a percentage of total card payment volume transacted by spending businesses that use Divvy cards, fraud and credit loss rate was approximately 0.28% for fiscal 2023. See \u201c\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Key Business Metrics\n\u201d for a detailed discussion of our key business metrics.\nSecurity, Privacy, and Data Protection\nTrust is important for our relationship with customers and partners, and we take significant measures designed to protect their privacy and the data that they provide to us. Keeping our customers\u2019 data safe and secure is a high priority. Our approach to security includes data governance as well as ongoing testing for potential security issues.\nWe have robust access controls in our production environment with access to data strictly assigned, monitored, and audited. To ensure our controls remain up-to-date, we undergo continuous external testing for vulnerabilities within our software architecture. These efforts have enabled us to certify our platform to SOC1 Type II, SOC2 Type II, and SOC3 standards. Our security program is aligned to the NIST-800-53 standards and is regularly audited and assessed by third parties as well as our partners, including some of the largest banks in the world.\nThe focus of our program is working to prevent unauthorized access to the data of our customers and network members. To this end, our team of security practitioners work to identify and mitigate risks, implement best practices, and continue to evaluate ways to improve.\nThese steps include close attention to network security, classifying and inventorying data, limiting and authorizing access controls, and multi-factor authentication for access to systems. We also employ regular system monitoring, logging, and alerting to retain and analyze the security state of our corporate and production infrastructures.\nWe take steps to help ensure that our security measures are maintained by the third-party suppliers we use, including conducting annual security reviews and audits.\nCompetition\nOur primary competition remains the legacy manual processes that SMBs have relied upon for decades. Other competitors range from large firms that predominantly focus on selling to enterprises, to providers of point solutions that focus exclusively on one of the many aspects of our business: document management, workflow management, accounts payable solutions, spend and expense management, card issuance, or accounts receivable solutions; to companies that offer industry-specific payment solutions.\nWe differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering a portfolio of financial back-office solutions that handle all of these core cash flow activities end-to-end. Our extensive investment in building a fully-integrated two-way sync with popular accounting software providers is well-regarded in the industry. With respect to the domestic payments that comprise the bulk of our business, we disburse and collect funds on behalf of our customers through our proprietary payments engine. We manage the associated financial risk of processing billions in total payment volume through our proprietary risk models and rules. \nWe believe that the key competitive factors in our market include:\n\u2022\nProduct features, quality, and functionality;\n\u2022\nData asset size and ability to leverage AI;\n\u2022\nEase of deployment;\n\u2022\nEase of integration with leading accounting and banking technology infrastructures;\n\u2022\nAbility to automate processes;\n\u2022\nCloud-based delivery architecture;\n\u2022\nAdvanced security and control features;\n9\n\u2022\nRegulatory compliance leadership, as evidenced by our money transmitter licenses in all required U.S. jurisdictions and in Canada;\n\u2022\nBrand recognition; and\n\u2022\nPricing and total cost of ownership.\nWe compare favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. We expect the market for SMB back-office financial software and business-to-business payment solutions to continue to evolve and grow, as greater numbers of SMBs and larger businesses digitize their back offices. We believe that we are well-positioned to help them.\nResearch & Development\nWe invest substantial time, energy, and resources to ensure we have a deep understanding of our customers\u2019 needs, and we continually innovate to deliver value-added products and services. Our technology organization consists of engineering, product, and design teams. These teams are responsible for the design, development, and testing of our applications. We focus our efforts on developing new functionality and further enhancing the usability, reliability, and performance of existing applications.\nSales and Marketing\nWe distribute our platform through direct and indirect sales channels, both of which we leverage to reach our target customers in an efficient manner. Our direct sales are driven by a self-service process and an inside sales team. Our inside sales team augments our direct sales capabilities by targeting potential customers that have engaged with us on their own.\nWe also reach customers indirectly through our partnerships with accounting firms, financial institutions, and accounting software providers. While these partners sometimes require an initial integration investment, a go-to-market flywheel takes effect as our partners accelerate the delivery of our platform across their customer base with minimal incremental investment from us.\nWe focus our marketing efforts on generating leads to develop our sales pipeline, building brand and category awareness, enabling our go-to-market partners, and growing our business from within our existing customers. Our sales leads primarily come through word-of-mouth, our accounting firm partners, and website searches. We generate additional leads through digital marketing campaigns, referrals, in-product customer education, brand advertising, public relations, and social media. \nAs part of our marketing efforts for our spend and expense management solution, we offer a card rewards program to drive card adoption, incent card usage, and drive card loyalty with spending businesses. Under the card rewards program, spending businesses \ncan earn rewards based on transaction volume on the cards issued to them and can redeem those rewards mainly for statement credits or cash, travel, and gift cards.\nCustomer Success\nSMBs have unique needs and customer support contact expectations. With more than a decade of experience supporting our product, our customer success team has a deep understanding of their needs and has developed our support model accordingly. We recognize and understand deep customer spending and behavior patterns because we see the aggregate \u2013 millions of transactions per month. We use what we learn to continuously improve the platform and the customer experience. We provide onboarding implementation support, as well as ongoing support and training. We periodically contact businesses using our solutions to discuss their utilization of our platform, highlight additional features that may interest them, and identify any additional tools that may be needed.\nRegulatory Environment\nWe operate in a rapidly-evolving regulatory environment. \n10\nPayments and Banking Regulation\nIn order to conduct the payment services we offer, we are required to be licensed to offer money transmission services in most U.S. states. We have procured and maintain money transmitter licenses that are required in 50 U.S. jurisdictions and actively work to comply with new license requirements as they arise. We are also registered as a Money Services Business with the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). These licenses and registrations subject us, among other things, to anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing requirements, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions obligations, record-keeping requirements, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, minimum capital requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and regulatory examinations by state and federal regulatory agencies.\nWe also hold a Foreign Money Services Business (FMSB) license in Canada that is administered by The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) and a Money Services Business License administered by Quebec's Autorit\u00e9 Des March\u00e9s Financiers (Financial Markets Authority). Global Affairs Canada and Canada's Department of Public Safety administer Canadian sanctions programs and oversee our compliance with these regulations. \nWe are contractually obligated to comply with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) federal banking regulations, as well as with Visa and MasterCard rules, as a card program manager for the card program management banks (CPMB) for our card product offerings. As a card program manager for the CPMBs, we have implemented compliance programs designed to ensure we are in compliance with applicable banking regulations and the Visa and MasterCard network rules. The CPMBs oversee our compliance program and conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and rules. We are also subject to the examination and enforcement authority of the FDIC under the Bank Service Company Act in our capacity as program manager to the CPMBs for our card product offerings.\nIn addition, we are subject to FDIC oversight through the provision of FDIC insured business deposit accounts provided by a regulated bank in relation to certain Invoice2Go products. \nWe maintain loan origination, brokering, and servicing licenses through our subsidiaries in a number of U.S. states and actively work to comply with new license requirements as they arise. \nOur services utilize ACH transfers and require compliance with National Automated Clearing House Association rules. We are required to comply with Regulation E, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, which regulates certain funds transfers.\nWe are procuring state lending, brokering, and servicing licenses to support lending products. We also partner with a FDIC and State of Utah regulated bank to offer lending products originated by such bank and may originate loans using our own licenses in the future. The lending products and services subject us to state and federal lending regulations including, but not limited to Fair Lending, state specific lending disclosures, and Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts and Practices and Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices requirements. \nAnti-money Laundering, Counter-terrorist Financing, and Sanctions.\nAs a Money Services Business and a licensed money transmitter we are subject to U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) laws and regulations, including under the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended (BSA), and similar U.S. state laws and regulations, and as a Foreign Money Service Business (MSB) in Canada we are subject to various AML laws and regulations in Canada. In addition, we are required to comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by OFAC, as well as similar requirements in other jurisdictions, including, among others, the Canadian Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act and the Australian Sanctions Regime. We have implemented an AML and sanctions compliance program designed to prevent our platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. Where we rely on partners for payment services, our partners have implemented AML and sanctions compliance programs. These compliance programs include policies, procedures, reporting protocols, systems, training, testing, independent audits, and internal controls designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and to assist in managing the risks associated with money laundering. Our United States (U.S.) compliance program includes the designation of a BSA compliance officer to oversee the program. These programs are also designed to manage terrorist financing risks and to comply with sanctions requirements to prevent our products from being used to facilitate \n11\nbusiness in certain countries, or with certain persons or entities, including those on designated lists promulgated by OFAC and relevant foreign authorities. \nData Protection and Information Security\nWe receive, store, process, and use a wide variety of personal, business, and financial information from prospective customers, existing customers, their vendors, and other users on our platform, as well as personal information about our employees and service providers. Our handling of this data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations. In the U.S. we are subject to privacy and information safeguarding requirements under the Graham Leach Bliley Act and state laws relating to privacy and data security, including the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. We are also subject to foreign laws and regulations governing the handling of personal data, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the United Kingdom's GDPR, Australian and Canadian privacy laws, and the privacy laws of other foreign jurisdictions. \nRegulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world. Regulatory authorities regularly consider new legislative and regulatory proposals and interpretive guidelines that may contain privacy and data protection obligations. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux. \nAnti-corruption\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. domestic bribery laws, and other anti-corruption laws in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, including, among others, Australia's anti-bribery laws, the Canadian Criminal Code, and the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.\nAdditional Regulatory Developments\nVarious regulatory agencies in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions continue to examine a wide variety of issues which are applicable to us and may impact our business. These issues include identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, and marketing. As our business continues to develop and expand, we continue to monitor the additional rules and regulations that may become relevant.\nAny actual or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, and constraints on our ability to continue to operate. For additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see the risk factors related to regulation of our payments business and regulation in the areas of privacy and data use, under the section titled \u201c\nRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to our Business and Industry\n.\u201d\nEnvironmental, Corporate Governance, and Social (ESG) Oversight and Initiatives  \nESG Management\nWe are committed to helping build a more sustainable future for businesses using our solutions, as well as for their communities, and stakeholders. We take this commitment seriously and will continue to provide transparent disclosures on the progress of this work through both our internal and external communications. Our executive leadership team sponsors and funds our ESG programs, with our board of directors exercising ultimate oversight. Guided by best practices, feedback we receive from our stockholders, and third-party frameworks such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Software & IT Services standards, we are focused on the initiatives described below.\n12\nOur Culture and Employees\nOur culture enables us to attract and retain exceptional talent. We center our culture around five values which are core to who we are, guide how we operate, define how we treat each other, and help make our teams strong, cohesive units:\n\u2022\nHumble \n\u2013 No ego;\n\u2022\nAuthentic \n\u2013 We are who we are;\n\u2022\nPassionate\n \u2013 Love what you do;\n\u2022\nAccountable \n\u2013 To each other and our network; and\n\u2022\nFun \n\u2013 Celebrate the moments.\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, we had a total of 2,521 employees working across three offices in the U.S.: San Jose, CA, Houston, TX, and Draper, UT; one office in Sydney, Australia; and others working remotely. We also employ individuals on a temporary basis and use the services of contractors as necessary. None of our employees are represented by a labor union in connection with their employment.  \nWe know our success is tied to recruiting, developing, and retaining our employees. Our Chief People Officer is responsible for creating and implementing our initiatives around our employees and our board of directors has ultimate oversight and receives updates on these initiatives periodically. \nWe leverage data and analytics to align the recruiting function to business growth and revenue drivers.  We are committed to providing a fair and equitable compensation and benefits program that supports our diverse workforce. BILL offers market-competitive base salaries, semi-annual bonuses, and sales incentives. The majority of our employees are awarded equity at the time of hire and through annual equity refresh grants. We also offer an employee stock purchase plan to foster a strong sense of ownership and engage our employees in our long-term success. Our full-time employees are eligible to receive, subject to the satisfaction of certain eligibility requirements, our comprehensive benefits package, including medical, dental, and vision insurance, family planning support and fertility treatments, and life and income protection plans. In addition, we provide generous paid time-off policies, access to free mental health services, and offer a tax-qualified 401(k) retirement plan. Through the self-directed brokerage features of the plan, participants in the 401(k) plan can choose to invest their contributions in funds focused on their particular goals and preferences, including having options of funds that are focused on their particular goals and preferences, such as ESG matters. \nWe develop our leaders and high-potential employees through intensive, cohort-based, key talent programs. We offer training for new people managers. To facilitate ongoing learning and development, we provide employees with an online curriculum of study, linked to business needs, leveraging a third-party platform. The curriculum includes coursework in inclusion, change management, and decision-making. All employees are eligible and participate in developmental reviews with their managers. We conduct performance review cycles twice a year.\nTo keep a pulse on engagement, we survey our employees semi-annually. Employees respond anonymously, and we take action on the areas flagged for improvement, reporting back to the employee base on progress against stated improvement goals. We closely monitor employee turnover, conducting exit interviews and surveys to alert us to any issues, as well as to make improvements to the employee experience.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nThrough an equitable approach to hiring, compensation, and career growth, we have built a company that fosters inclusivity, authenticity, and action. We seek to embed a sense of inclusion and social responsibility into our culture and how we serve the businesses using our solutions. Our Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) is building a strategy that helps us accelerate our progress across four key pillars:\n\u2022\ncultivating a respectful and accessible workplace where every employee feels they belong;\n\u2022\nincreasing diverse representation at all levels and functions of the company;\n\u2022\nsupporting our diverse customers\u2019 needs through our products and services; and\n\u2022\nengaging with our communities to promote more equitable outcomes.\n13\nOne of the ways we strengthen our workplace culture of DEI is by supporting employee resource groups (ERGs). ERGs are self-organized communities that bring employees together to raise awareness and belonging for under-represented groups. Through a grassroots effort, BILL employees have established seven ERGs focused upon the following dimensions of identity: women, Latinx, Black, LGBTQIA+, disabilities and mental health, veterans, and Pan Asian and Pacific Islanders. These ERGs have established strong employee mentorship programs to support the career development of their members. \nWe also offer employees learning opportunities to increase awareness of DEI issues. Unconscious bias training is available through our e-learning platform, we regularly host speakers from diverse backgrounds to share their lived experiences, and our ERGs host safe-space discussions on issues important to their members.  \nWe partner with organizations like Codepath.org and ColorStack to support Black, Latinx, and Indigenous students interested in technical careers. Through Codepath\u2019s Internship Connection Program, we have placed underrepresented students majoring in computer science into technical internships at BILL. Last year, we also sponsored the Tejano Tech Summit, which brought together Latinx founders, investors, and professionals working in tech to advance their community. Our talent acquisition team also developed our ERG Ambassador Program, which gives candidates an opportunity to connect with an ERG member to learn more about BILL\u2019s culture and our focus on DEI. We are hopeful that through programs and partnerships like these, we can both help local communities and build a solid pipeline of future employees for our company.  \nAs part of our focus on community outreach, one of our BILL ERGs built a new program to reach underprivileged, low-income students in the Bay Area. Recruiting middle-school and high-school students locally, the program\u2019s goal is to prepare these young students for academic success, college acceptance, and early career growth by providing internships, mentorships, and coding camps. Along with the African Diaspora Network, BILL founded the African Diaspora Network's Accelerating Black Leadership and Entrepreneurship (ABLE) program, an enterprise accelerator program. The program is designed to strengthen, energize, and support startups and small businesses led by Black entrepreneurs in the U.S. In the last two years, 28 entrepreneurs with impact-oriented solutions at the local and national level across multiple sectors graduated from ABLE. \nEnvironmental Matters\nOur San Jose headquarters building is LEED Gold and Energy Star certified, our Houston building is LEED-certified GOLD, and our Sydney building features a green roof and an organic waste farm, and was awarded a \u2018Green Star\u2019 rating of six (the highest rating available). In San Jose, we also offer employees free electric vehicle charging stations. Further, we embrace a hybrid work model at each of our office locations, permitting employees to work remotely several days a week, in addition to having a significant number of fully-remote employees who collaborate via videoconference and periodic offsite retreats.  This flexible model allows us to minimize employee commute times, thereby reducing congestion, the consumption of energy, and pollution.\nIntellectual Property\nWe seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying upon a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as contractual measures.\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, in the U.S., we had 20 issued patents that expire between 2028 and 2040, and seven pending patent applications, two of which have been allowed as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, along with five pending international patent applications. These patents and patent applications seek to protect proprietary inventions relevant to our business. While we believe our patents and patent applications in the aggregate are important to our competitive position, no single patent or patent application is material to us as a whole. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, in the U.S. we had two trademark registrations covering the \u201cBill.com\u201d logo and three trademark registrations for DIVVY or the Divvy logo, along with registrations for Divvy slogans. We also own a U.S. trademark registration for the name Invoice2Go and the Invoice2Go logo. We own a pending application for BILL.COM plus design in Canada, along with a registration in Canada for the Invoice2Go logo. We own one registration in Australia for the Invoice2Go logo, along with additional registrations internationally \n14\nfor the mark INVOICE2GO or the Invoice2Go logo. We will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. We also own several domain names, including www.bill.com, www.getdivvy.com, and www.invoice2go.com. \nWe rely on trade secrets and confidential information to develop and maintain our competitive position. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements (or similar agreements) with our employees, consultants, and contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our terms of service.\nFrom time to time, we also incorporate certain intellectual property licensed from third parties, including under certain open source licenses. Even if any such third-party technology was not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technologies would be available as needed.\n For additional information about our intellectual property and associated risks, see the section titled \u201c\nRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to our Business and Industry\n.\u201d\n \nAvailable Information\nOur internet address is www.bill.com. We make available free of charge, on our website, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nWe have used, and intend to continue to use, our website, investor relations website (accessible via our website), and social media accounts, including our Twitter/X feed (@billcom), our LinkedIn page and our Facebook page   , as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nThe contents of the websites provided above are not intended to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.

    "item1a": ">Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201c\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n,\u201d our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. Additional risks beyond those summarized below or discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may apply to our activities or operations as currently conducted or as we may conduct them in the future or in the markets in which we operate or may in the future operate. \nSummary of Risk Factors\nConsistent with the foregoing, we are exposed to a variety of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future;\n\u2022\nOur recent rapid growth, including growth in our volume of payments, may not be indicative of our future growth, and if we continue to grow rapidly, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively;\n\u2022\nA significant portion of our revenue comes from small and medium-sized businesses, which may have fewer financial resources to weather an economic downturn, and volatile or weakened economic conditions in the U.S. and globally may adversely affect our business and operating results;\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to attract new customers or convert trial customers into paying customers or if our efforts to promote our charge card usage through marketing, promotion, and spending business rewards are unsuccessful, our revenue growth and operating results will be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to retain our current customers, increase customer adoption of our products, sell additional services to our customers, or develop and launch new payment products, our business and growth will be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nOur Divvy card offering exposes us to credit risk and other risks related to spending businesses' ability to pay the balances incurred on their Divvy cards. Certain of our other current and future product offerings may also subject us to credit risk;\n\u2022\nOur risk management efforts may not be effective to prevent fraudulent activities by our customers, subscribers, spending businesses, or their counterparties, which could expose us to material financial losses and liability and otherwise harm our business;\n\u2022\nThe markets in which we participate are competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed;\n\u2022\nWe transfer large sums of customer funds daily, and are subject to numerous associated risks which could result in financial losses, damage to our reputation, or loss of trust in our brand, which would harm our business and financial results;\n\u2022\nOur business depends, in part, on our relationships with accounting firms;\n\u2022\nOur business depends, in part, on our business relationships with financial institutions;\n\u2022\nWe are subject to numerous risks related to partner banks and financing arrangements with respect to our spend and expense management solution;\n\u2022\nFuture acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, collaborations, or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nPayments and other financial services-related regulations and oversight are material to our business. Our failure to comply could materially harm our business;\n16\n\u2022\nOur debt service obligations, including the Notes, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary for cash settlement upon conversion of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes for cash upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes; and\n\u2022\nThe market for our common stock has been, and will likely continue to be, volatile and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe were incorporated in 2006 and have mostly experienced net losses since inception. We generated net losses of $223.7 million, $326.4 million, and $98.7 million for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Our net loss for fiscal 2022 includes the results of operations of Invoice2go from the date of acquisition on September 1, 2022 and of Divvy for the full fiscal year. Our net loss for fiscal 2021 includes the results of operations of Divvy from the date of acquisition on June 1, 2021. As of June\u00a030, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $856.2 million. While we have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods, we are not certain whether or when we will generate sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We also expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods, which could negatively affect our future operating results if our revenue does not increase. In particular, we intend to continue to expend significant funds to further develop our platform, including introducing new products and functionality, drive new customer adoption, expand partner integrations, and support international expansion, and to continue hiring across all functions to accomplish these objectives. Our profitability each quarter is also impacted by the mix of our revenue generated from subscriptions, transaction fees, including the mix of ad valorem transaction revenue, and interest earned on funds that we hold for the benefit of our customers. Any changes in this revenue mix will have the effect of increasing or decreasing our margins. In addition, we offer promotion programs whereby spending businesses that use our spend and expense management products can earn rewards based on transaction volume on our Divvy charge cards, and the cost of earned rewards that are redeemed impacts our sales and marketing expenses. Inflationary pressures may also result in increases in many of our other costs, including personnel-related costs. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our increased operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for several reasons, including the other risks described herein, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the value of our business and common stock may significantly decrease.\nOur recent rapid growth, including growth in our volume of payments, may not be indicative of our future growth, and if we continue to grow rapidly, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively. \nOur revenue was $1.1 billion, $642.0 million, and $238.3 million during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Our TPV was $266.0 billion, $228.1 billion, and $140.7 billion during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Our revenue and TPV for fiscal 2022 includes Invoice2go from the date of acquisition on September 1, 2021 and Divvy charge cards for the full fiscal year. Our revenue and TPV for fiscal 2021 includes Divvy charge cards from the date of acquisition on June 1, 2021. Although we have recently experienced significant growth in our revenue and total payment volume, even if our revenue continues to increase, we expect our growth rate will decline in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including the increasing scale of our business. Overall growth of our revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nprice our platform effectively to attract new customers and increase sales to our existing customers;\n\u2022\nexpand the functionality and scope of the products we offer on our platform;\n\u2022\nmaintain or improve the rates at which customers subscribe to and continue to use our platform;\n\u2022\nmaintain and expand payment volume;\n\u2022\ngenerate interest income on customer funds that we hold in trust;\n17\n\u2022\nprovide our customers with high-quality customer support that meets their needs;\n\u2022\nintroduce our products to new markets outside of the U.S.;\n\u2022\nserve SMBs across a wide cross-section of industries;\n\u2022\nexpand our target market beyond SMBs;\n\u2022\nmanage the effects of macroeconomic conditions, including economic downturns or recessions, inflation, fluctuations in market interest rates and currency exchange rates, supply chain shortages and instability in the U.S. and global banking systems on our business and operations;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform; and\n\u2022\nincrease awareness of our brand and successfully compete with other companies.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives, which makes it difficult for us to forecast our future operating results. Further, the revenue that we derive from interest income on customer funds is dependent on interest rates, which we do not control. If the assumptions that we use to plan our business are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our market, or if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, our stock price could be volatile, and it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability. You should not rely on our revenue from any prior quarterly or annual periods as any indication of our future revenue or revenue or payment growth.\nIn addition, we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u2022\nsales, marketing, and customer success, including an expansion of our sales organization and new customer success initiatives;\n\u2022\nour technology infrastructure, including systems architecture, scalability, availability, performance, and security;\n\u2022\nproduct development, including investments in our product development team and the development of new products and new functionality for our AI-enabled platform;\n\u2022\nacquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022\ninternational expansion; and\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance and risk management.\nThese investments may not result in increased revenue growth in our business. If we are unable to increase our revenue at a rate sufficient to offset the expected increase in our costs, or if we encounter difficulties in managing a growing volume of payments, our business, financial condition, and operating results will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability over the long term.\nA significant portion of our revenue comes from small and medium-sized businesses, which may have fewer financial resources to weather an economic downturn, and volatile or weakened economic conditions in the U.S. and globally may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur overall performance depends in part on U.S. and international macroeconomic conditions. The U.S. and other key international economies have experienced and may in the future experience significant economic and market downturns in which economic activity is impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity, and foreign exchange markets, inflation, bankruptcies, and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions are impossible to predict. In addition, geopolitical and domestic political developments, such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control, such as the war in Ukraine, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. Moreover, there has been recent turmoil in the global banking system. For example, in March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the FDIC as receiver. First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company then assumed all of SVB\u2019s customer deposits and certain other liabilities and \n18\nacquired substantially all of SVB\u2019s loans and certain other assets from the FDIC. While the closure of SVB did not have a material direct impact on our business, continued instability in the global banking system may result in additional bank failures, as well as volatility of global financial markets, either of which may adversely impact our business and financial condition. \nFurther, a significant portion of our revenue comes from SMBs. These customers may be more susceptible to negative impacts from economic downturns, recession, inflation, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including the strengthening U.S. dollar, financial market conditions, instability in the U.S. and global banking systems, supply chain shortages, increased fuel prices, any ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and catastrophic events than larger, more established businesses, as SMBs typically have more limited financial resources than larger entities. If any of these conditions occur\n,\n SMBs may be disproportionately impacted and, as a result, the overall demand for our products and services could be materially and adversely affected. \nWe expect fluctuations in our financial results, making it difficult to project future results, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors with respect to our operating results, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition to the other risks described herein, factors that may affect our operating results include the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for, or pricing of our platform;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and grow engagement with our existing customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand our relationships with our accounting firm partners, financial institution partners, and accounting software partners, or identify and attract new partners;\n\u2022\ncustomer expansion rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer preference for cloud-based services as a result of security breaches in the industry or privacy concerns, or other security or reliability concerns regarding our products;\n\u2022\nfluctuations or delays in purchasing decisions in anticipation of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, market, credit and liquidity conditions, both domestically and internationally, such as high inflation, high interest rate and recessionary environments, and instability in the U.S. and global banking systems, as well as economic conditions specifically affecting SMBs or the industries in which our customers participate;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 budgets and in the timing of their budget cycles and purchasing decisions, as a result of general economic factors or factors specific to their businesses;\n\u2022\npotential and existing customers choosing our competitors\u2019 products or developing their own solutions in-house;\n\u2022\nthe development or introduction of new platforms or services that are easier to use or more advanced than our current suite of services, especially related to the application of AI-based services;\n\u2022\nour failure to adapt to new forms of payment that become widely accepted;\n\u2022\nthe adoption or retention of more entrenched or rival services in the international markets where we compete;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of payment for operating expenses, particularly research and development and sales and marketing expenses, including commissions;\n19\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation, goodwill impairments, and other non-cash charges;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training, and integrating new employees, including employees acquired inorganically, and retaining and motivating existing employees;\n\u2022\nfluctuation in market interest rates, which impacts interest earned on funds held for customers;\n\u2022\nthe effects of acquisitions and the integration of acquired technologies and products, including impairment of goodwill;\n\u2022\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our platform; \n\u2022\nany ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, customers, partners, vendors, operating results, liquidity and financial condition, including as a result of supply chain disruptions and labor shortages;\n\u2022\nt\nhe impact of the war in Ukraine, economic sanctions and countermeasures taken by other countries, and market volatility resulting from the above; and\n\u2022\nawareness of our brand and our reputation in our target markets.\nAny of these and other factors, or the cumulative effect of some of these factors, may cause our operating results to vary significantly. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant additional expenses due to the costs of operating as a public company. If our operating results fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our common stock could decline substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers or convert trial customers into paying customers or if our efforts to promote our charge card usage through marketing, promotion, and spending business rewards are unsuccessful, our revenue growth and operating results will be adversely affected.\nTo increase our revenue, we must continue to attract new customers and increase sales to those customers. As our market matures, product and service offerings evolve, and competitors introduce lower cost or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete with our platform, our ability to sell subscriptions or successfully increase customer adoption of new payment products could be impaired. Similarly, our subscription sales could be adversely affected if customers or users perceive that features incorporated into alternative products reduce the need for our platform or if they prefer to purchase products that are bundled with solutions offered by other companies. Further, in an effort to attract new customers, we may offer simpler, lower-priced products or promotions, which may reduce our profitability. \nWe rely upon our marketing strategy of offering risk-free trials of our platform and other digital marketing strategies to generate sales opportunities. Many of our customers start a risk-free trial of our service. Converting these trial customers to paid customers often requires extensive follow-up and engagement. Many prospective customers never convert from the trial version of a product to a paid version of a product. Further, we often depend on the ability of individuals within an organization who initiate the trial versions of our products to convince decision makers within their organization to convert to a paid version. To the extent that these users do not become, or are unable to convince others to become, paying customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of this marketing strategy, and our ability to grow our revenue will be adversely affected. In addition, it may be necessary to engage in more sophisticated and costly sales and marketing efforts in order to attract new customers, and changes in privacy laws and third party practices may make adding new customers more expensive or difficult. As a result of these and other factors, we may be unable to attract new customers or our related expenses may increase, which would have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, gross margins, and operating results.\nIn addition, revenue growth from our charge card products is dependent on increasing business spending on our cards. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to capture a greater \n20\nshare of spending businesses\u2019 total spend, but there can be no assurance that such investments will be effective. In addition, if we develop new products or offerings that attract spending businesses looking for short-term incentives rather than displaying long-term loyalty, attrition could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected. Expanding our service offerings, adding acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements and could dilute our brand. In addition, we offer rewards to spending businesses based on their usage of charge cards. Redemptions of rewards present significant associated expenses for our business. We operate in a highly competitive environment and may need to increase the rewards that we offer or provide other incentives to spending businesses in order to grow our business. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, such costs could adversely affect or harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to retain our current customers, increase customer adoption of our products, sell additional services to our customers, or develop and launch new payment products, our business and growth will be adversely affected.\nTo date, a significant portion of our growth has been attributable to customer adoption of new and existing payment products. To increase our revenue, in addition to acquiring new customers, we must continue to retain existing customers and convince them to expand their use of our platform by incentivizing them to pay for additional services and driving adoption of new and existing payment products, including ad valorem products such as our Divvy cards, virtual cards, instant transfer, and international payment offerings. Our ability to retain our customers, drive adoption and increase usage could be impaired for a variety of reasons, including our inability to develop and launch new payment products, customer reaction to changes in the pricing of our products, general economic conditions or the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our ability to sell additional services or increase customer adoption of new or existing products may require more sophisticated and costly sales and marketing efforts, especially for our larger customers. If we are unable to retain existing customers or increase the usage of our platform by them, it would have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, gross margins, and other operating results, and accordingly, on the trading price of our common stock.\nWhile some of our contracts are non-cancelable annual subscription contracts, most of our contracts with customers and accounting firms primarily consist of open-ended arrangements that can be terminated by either party without penalty at any time. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions to our platform after the expiration of their subscription period. For us to maintain or improve our operating results, it is important that our customers continue to maintain their subscriptions on the same or more favorable terms. We cannot accurately predict renewal or expansion rates given the diversity of our customer base in terms of size, industry, and geography. Our renewal and expansion rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of several factors, including customer spending levels, customer satisfaction with our platform and customer service, decreases in the number of users, changes in the type and size of our customers, pricing changes, competitive conditions, the acquisition of our customers by other companies, and general economic conditions. In addition, if any of the accounting software providers with which our platform currently integrates should choose to disable two-way synchronization, there can be no assurance that customers shared with such providers would not choose to leave our platform, adversely affecting our business and results of operations.  If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, or if they reduce their usage of our platform, our revenue and other operating results will decline and our business will suffer. Moreover, if our renewal or expansion rates fall significantly below the expectations of the public market, securities analysts, or investors, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline.\nOur Divvy card offering exposes us to credit risk and other risks related to spending businesses' ability to pay the balances incurred on their Divvy cards. Certain of our other current and future product offerings may also subject us to credit risk.\nWe offer our Divvy card as a credit product to a wide range of businesses in the U.S., and the success of this product depends on our ability to effectively manage related risks. The credit decision-making process for our Divvy cards uses techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific businesses based on, among other factors, their past purchase and transaction history, as well as their credit scores. Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess current or prospective spending businesses who desire to use our cards to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict \n21\ncreditworthiness due to inaccurate assumptions, including assumptions related to the particular spending business, market conditions, economic environment, or limited transaction history or other data, among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our cards may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, competitors\u2019 actions, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, policies of Issuing Banks, and other factors. \nFor a substantial majority of extensions of credit to Divvy spending businesses facilitated through our spend and expense management platform, we purchase from our Issuing Banks participation interests in the accounts receivables generated when  spending businesses make purchases using Divvy cards, and we bear the entire credit risk in the event that a spending business fails to pay card balances. Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from credit, we face the risk that spending businesses will default on their payment obligations, creating the risk of potential charge-offs. The non-payment rate among  spending businesses may increase due to, among other factors, changes to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a business, or a decline in economic conditions, such as a recession, high inflation or government austerity programs. Spending businesses who miss payments may fail to repay their outstanding statement balances, and spending businesses who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their outstanding balances. If collection efforts on overdue card balances are ineffective or unsuccessful, we may incur financial losses or lose the confidence of our funding sources.\n \nWe do not file UCC liens or take other security interests on Divvy card balances, which significantly reduces our ability to collect amounts outstanding to spending businesses that file for bankruptcy protection. Any such losses or failures of our risk models could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Non-performance, or even significant underperformance, of the account receivables participation interests that we own could have an adverse effect on our business.\nMoreover, the funding model for our Divvy card product relies on a variety of funding arrangements, including warehouse facilities and, from time-to-time, purchase arrangements, with a variety of funding sources. Any significant underperformance of the participation interests we own may adversely impact our relationship with such funding sources and result in an increase in our cost of financing, a modification or termination of our existing funding arrangements or our ability to procure funding, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and future prospects.\nSeveral of our other product offerings whereby we advance funds to our customers or vendors of our customers based on credit and risk profiling before we receive the funds on their behalf, such as our Instant Transfer feature, also expose us to credit risks. Although these offerings are only available to customers that satisfy specific credit eligibility criteria, the credit and risk models we use to determine eligibility may be insufficient. Any failure of our credit or risk models to predict creditworthiness would expose us to many of the credit risks described above and could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur risk management efforts may not be effective to prevent fraudulent activities by our customers, subscribers, spending businesses, or their counterparties, which could expose us to material financial losses and liability and otherwise harm our business.\nWe offer software that digitizes and automates financial operations for a large number of customers and executes payments to their vendors or from their clients. We are responsible for verifying the identity of our customers and their users, and monitoring transactions for fraud. We have been in the past and will continue to be targeted by parties who seek to commit acts of financial fraud using stolen identities and bank accounts, compromised business email accounts, employee or insider fraud, account takeover, false applications, check fraud, and stolen cards or card account numbers. We may suffer losses from acts of financial fraud committed by our customers and their users, our employees, or third parties. In addition, our customers or spending businesses may suffer losses from acts of financial fraud by third parties posing as our company through account takeover, credential harvesting, use of stolen identities, and various other techniques, which could harm our reputation or prompt us to reimburse our customers for such losses in order to maintain customer and spending business relationships.\nThe techniques used to perpetrate fraud on our platform are continually evolving, and we expend considerable resources to continue to monitor and combat them. In addition, when we introduce new products and functionality, or expand existing products, we may not be able to identify all risks created by such new products or functionality. Our risk management policies, procedures, techniques, and processes may not be \n22\nsufficient to identify all of the risks to which we are exposed, to enable us to prevent or mitigate the risks we have identified, or to identify additional risks to which we may become subject in the future. Our risk management policies, procedures, techniques, and processes may contain errors, or our employees or agents may commit mistakes or errors in judgment as a result of which we may suffer large financial losses. The software-driven and highly automated nature of our platform could enable criminals and those committing fraud to steal significant amounts of money from businesses like ours.\nOur current business and anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our risk management efforts, and we will need to continue developing and improving our existing risk management infrastructure, policies, procedures, techniques, and processes. As techniques used to perpetrate fraud on our platform evolve, we may need to modify our products or services to mitigate fraud risks. As our business grows and becomes more complex, we may be less able to forecast and carry appropriate reserves in our books for fraud related losses. \nFurther, these types of fraudulent activities on our platform can also expose us to civil and criminal liability and governmental and regulatory sanctions as well as potentially cause us to be in breach of our contractual obligations to our third-party partners.\nThe markets in which we participate are competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for cloud-based software that automates the financial back-office is highly fragmented, competitive, and constantly evolving. We believe that our primary competition remains the legacy manual processes that SMBs have relied on for generations. Our success will depend, to a substantial extent, on the widespread adoption of our cloud-based automated back-office solution as an alternative to existing solutions or adoption by customers that are not using any such solutions at all. Some organizations may be reluctant or unwilling to use our platform for several reasons, including concerns about additional costs, uncertainty regarding the reliability and security of cloud-based offerings, or lack of awareness of the benefits of our platform.\nOur competitors in the cloud-based software space range from large corporations that predominantly focus on enterprise resource planning solutions, to smaller niche suppliers of solutions that focus exclusively on document management, workflow management, accounts payable, accounts receivable, spend and expense management, and/or electronic bill presentment and payment, to companies that offer industry-specific payments solutions. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect that the competitive environment will remain intense going forward. Our competitors that currently focus on enterprise solutions may offer products to SMBs that compete with ours. In addition, companies that provide solutions that are adjacent to our products and services may decide to enter our market segments and develop and offer products that compete with ours. Accounting software providers, such as Intuit, as well as the financial institutions with which we partner, may internally develop products, acquire existing, third-party products, or may enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships that would enable them to expand their product offerings to compete with our platform or provide more comprehensive offerings than they individually had offered or achieve greater economies of scale than us. These software providers and financial institutions may have the operating flexibility to bundle competing solutions with other offerings, including offering them at a lower price or for no additional cost to customers as part of a larger sale. For example, in September 2022, Intuit announced its intention to launch a native bill payment solution. In addition, new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships, or strategic relationships. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer relationships, larger marketing budgets, and greater resources than us. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, and customer requirements. Certain competitors may also have long-standing exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with financial services provider partners to accept payment cards and other services that compete with what we offer.  As we look to market and sell our platform to potential customers, spending businesses, or partners with existing solutions, we must convince their internal stakeholders that our platform is superior to their current solutions.\nWe compete on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nproduct features, quality, breadth, and functionality;\n23\n\u2022\ndata asset size and ability to leverage AI to grow faster and smarter;\n\u2022\nease of deployment;\n\u2022\nease of integration with leading accounting and banking technology infrastructures;\n\u2022\nability to automate processes;\n\u2022\ncloud-based delivery architecture;\n\u2022\nadvanced security and control features;\n\u2022\nrisk management, exception process handling, and regulatory compliance leadership;\n\u2022\nbrand recognition; and\n\u2022\npricing and total cost of ownership.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, and this competition could result in the failure of our platform to continue to achieve or maintain market acceptance, any of which would harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe transfer large sums of customer funds daily, and are subject to numerous associated risks which could result in financial losses, damage to our reputation, or loss of trust in our brand, which would harm our business and financial results.\n As of June\u00a030, 2023, we had approximately 461,000 businesses using our solutions and TPV processed was approximately $266.0 billion, $228.1 billion, and $140.7 billion during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Accordingly, we have grown rapidly and seek to continue to grow, and although we maintain a robust and multi-faceted risk management process, our business is highly complex and always subject to the risk of financial losses as a result of credit losses, operational errors, software defects, service disruption, employee misconduct, security breaches, or other similar actions or errors on our platform.  \nAs a provider of accounts payable, accounts receivable, spend and expense management, and payment solutions, we collect and transfer funds on behalf of our customers and our trustworthiness and reputation are fundamental to our business. The occurrence of any credit losses, operational errors, software defects, service disruptions, employee misconduct, security breaches, or other similar actions or errors on our platform could result in financial losses to our business and our customers, loss of trust, damage to our reputation, or termination of our agreements with financial institution partners and accountants, each of which could result in:\n\u2022\nloss of customers;\n\u2022\nlost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our platform;\n\u2022\nlegal claims against us, including warranty and service level agreement claims;\n\u2022\nregulatory enforcement action; or\n\u2022\ndiversion of our resources, including through increased service expenses or financial concessions, and increased insurance costs.\nAlthough our terms of service allocate to our customers the risk of loss resulting from our customers\u2019 errors, omissions, employee fraud, or other fraudulent activity related to their systems, in some instances we may cover such losses for efficiency or to prevent damage to our reputation. Although we maintain insurance to cover losses resulting from our errors and omissions, there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover all losses or our coverage will be sufficient to cover our losses. If we suffer significant losses or reputational harm as a result, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n24\nFunds that we hold for the benefit of our customers are subject to market, interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, and liquidity risks, as well as general political and economic conditions. The loss of any of these funds could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe invest funds that we hold for the benefit of our customers, including funds being remitted to suppliers, in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, money market securities, and other cash equivalents. Nevertheless, our customer fund assets are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, and liquidity risks. These risks may be exacerbated, individually or in the aggregate, during periods of heavy financial market volatility, such as that experienced in 2008 and 2022, that may result from high inflation, high interest rate or recessionary environments, from actual or perceived instability in the U.S. and global banking systems, or from war (such as the war in Ukraine), or other geopolitical conflicts. As a result, we could be faced with a severe constriction of the availability of liquidity, which could impact our ability to fulfill our obligations to move customer money to its intended recipient. For example, the sudden closure of SVB in March 2023 introduced a potential risk of loss because we held certain corporate and customer funds at SVB.  Although we were\n able to move substantially all such funds to large multinational financial institutions and to redirect substantially all customer payment processing previously made through SVB to one of our multinational bank processors, there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so in the future in the event of a similar or more severe, systemic banking crisis. \nIn addition, cash held at banks and financial institutions is subject to applicable deposit insurance limits, and in the event that our corporate or customer funds held at a given institution exceed such limits, or are held in investments that are not covered by deposit insurance, such funds may be unrecoverable in the event of a future bank failure. \nWe rely upon certain banking partners and third parties to originate payments, process checks, execute wire transfers, and issue virtual cards, which could be similarly affected by a liquidity shortage and further exacerbate our ability to operate our business. Any loss of or inability to access customer funds could have an adverse impact on our cash position and operating results, could require us to obtain additional sources of liquidity, and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition to the risks related to customer funds, we are also exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investments of our corporate cash. \nWe are licensed as a money transmitter in all required U.S. states and registered as a Money Services Business with FinCEN. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, we are required to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant regulators in each jurisdiction, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. Our ability to manage and accurately account for the assets underlying our customer funds and comply with applicable liquid asset requirements requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, we will need to scale these associated internal controls. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers\u2019 balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to accurately manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products, and result in significant penalties and fines, possibly including the loss of our state money transmitter licenses, which would materially harm our business.\nWe earn revenue from interest earned on customer funds held in trust while payments are clearing, which is subject to market conditions and may decrease as customers\u2019 adoption of electronic payments and technology continues to evolve.\nFor fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, we generated $113.8 million, $8.6 million, and $6.0 million, respectively, in revenue from interest earned on funds held in trust on behalf of customers while payment transactions were clearing, or approximately 11%, 1%, and 3% of our total revenue for such periods, respectively. While these payments are clearing, we deposit the funds in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, and generate revenue that is correlated to the federal funds rate. As interest rates have risen in recent periods, the amount of revenue we have generated from such funds has increased; however, given the deceleration in U.S. interest rate increases in 2023 to date, we do not expect this interest revenue expansion to continue in the future. If interest rates decline, the amount of revenue we generate from these investments will decrease as well. Additionally, as customers increasingly seek expedited methods of electronic payments, such as instant transfer, or potentially migrate spend to our Divvy corporate card offering, our revenue from interest earned on customer funds could decrease (even if offset by other revenue) and our operating results could be adversely affected. Finally, in addition to the risks outlined above, any change in laws \n25\nor applicable regulations that restrict the scope of permissible investments for such customer funds could reduce our interest income and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business depends, in part, on our relationships with accounting firms.\nOur relationships with our more than 7,000 accounting firm partners contribute a significant portion of our consolidated revenue. We market and sell our products and services through accounting firms. We also have an exclusive partnership with CPA.com to market certain of our products and services to accounting firms, which then enroll their customers directly onto our platform. Although our relationships with accounting firms are independent of one another, if our reputation in the accounting industry more broadly were to suffer, or if we were unable to establish relationships with new accounting firms and grow our relationships with existing accounting firm partners, our growth prospects would weaken and our business, financial position, and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur business depends, in part, on our business relationships with financial institutions.\nWe enter into partnering relationships with financial institutions pursuant to which they offer our services to their customers. These relationships involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to our direct SMB customers. Launching a product offering with our financial institution partners entails integrating our platform with our partners\u2019 websites and apps, which requires significant engineering resources and time to design, deploy, and maintain, and requires developing associated sales and marketing strategies and programs. With financial institution partners, the decision to roll out our product offering typically requires several levels of management and technical personnel approval by our partners and is frequently subject to budget constraints. Delays in decision making, unplanned budget constraints, or changes in our partners\u2019 business, business priorities, or internal resource allocations may result in significant delays to the deployment of our platform and its availability to their customers. Significant delays in the deployment of our platform to our partners\u2019 customers could cause us to incur significant expenditures for platform integration and product launch without generating anticipated revenue in the same period or at all and could adversely impact our operating results. In addition, once we have successfully launched a product offering with a financial institution partner, lower than anticipated customer adoption or unanticipated ongoing system integration costs could result in lower than anticipated profit margins, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, and operating results. Moreover, if our partners or their customers experience problems with the operation of our platform, such as service outages or interruptions or security breaches or incidents, our relationship with the partner and our reputation could be harmed and our operating results may suffer.\nWe may not be able to attract new financial institution partners if our potential partners favor our competitors\u2019 products or services over our platform or choose to compete with our products directly. Further, many of our existing financial institution partners have greater resources than we do and could choose to develop their own solutions to replace ours. Moreover, certain financial institutions may elect to focus on other market segments and decide to terminate their SMB-focused services. If we are unsuccessful in establishing, growing, or maintaining our relationships with financial institution partners, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired, and our operating results may suffer.\nWe are subject to oversight by our financial institution partners and they conduct audits of our operations, information security controls, and compliance controls. To the extent an audit were to identify material gaps or evidence of noncompliance in our operations or controls it could violate contractual terms with the financial institution partner, which could materially and adversely impact our commercial relationships with that partner. \nOur spend and expense management products are dependent on our relationship with our Issuing Banks, Cross River Bank and WEX Bank.\nThe extensions of credit facilitated through our platform are originated through Cross River Bank and WEX Bank, and we rely on these entities to comply with various federal, state, and other laws. There has been significant recent U.S. Congressional and federal administrative agency lawmaking and ruling in the area of program agreements between banks and non-banks involving extensions of credit and the regulatory environment in this area remains unsettled. There has also been significant recent government enforcement and litigation challenging the validity of such arrangements, including disputes seeking to re-characterize lending transactions on the basis that the non-bank party rather than the bank is the \u201ctrue lender\u201d or \u201cde facto \n26\nlender\u201d, and in case law upholding the \u201cvalid when made\u201d doctrine, which holds that federal preemption of state interest rate limitations are not applicable in the context of certain bank\u2014non-bank partnership arrangements. If the legal structure underlying our relationship with our Issuing Banks were to be successfully challenged, our extension of credit offerings through these banks may be determined to be in violation of state licensing requirements and other state laws. In addition, Issuing Banks engaged in this activity have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny recently. Adverse orders or regulatory enforcement actions against our Issuing Banks, even if unrelated to our business, could impose restrictions on our Issuing Banks\u2019 ability to continue to extend credit through our platform or on current terms, or could result in our Issuing Banks increasing their oversight or imposing tighter controls over our underwriting practices or compliance procedures or subjecting any new products to be offered through our Issuing Banks to more rigorous reviews.\nOur Issuing Banks are subject to oversight by the FDIC and state banking regulators and must comply with applicable federal and state banking rules, regulations, and examination requirements. We, in turn, are subject to audit by our Issuing Banks in accordance with FDIC guidance related to management of service providers and other bank-specific requirements pursuant to the terms of our agreements with our Issuing Banks. We are also subject to the examination and enforcement authority of the FDIC under the Bank Service Company Act and state regulators in our capacity as a service provider for our Issuing Banks. If we fail to comply with requirements applicable to us by law or contract, or if audits by our Issuing Banks were to conclude that our processes and procedures are insufficient, we may be subject to fines or penalties or our Issuing Banks could terminate their relationships with us.\nIn the event of a challenge to the legal structure underlying our program agreements with our Issuing Banks or if one or all of our Issuing Banks were to suspend, limit, or cease its operations, or were to otherwise terminate for any reason (including, but not limited to, the failure by an Issuing Bank to comply with regulatory actions or an Issuing Bank experiencing financial distress, entering into receivership, or becoming insolvent), we would need to identify and implement alternative, compliant, bank relationships or otherwise modify our business practices in order to be compliant with prevailing law or regulation, which could result in business interruptions or delays, force us to incur additional expenses, and potentially interfere with our existing customer and spending business relationships or make us less attractive to potential new customers and spending businesses, any of which could adversely effect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe rely on a variety of funding sources to support our Divvy corporate card offering. If our existing funding arrangements are not renewed or replaced, or if our existing funding sources are unwilling or unable to provide funding to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all, it could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows, and future prospects. \nTo support the operations and growth of our spend and expense management business, we must maintain a variety of funding arrangements, including warehouse facilities and, from time-to-time, purchase arrangements with financial institutions. In particular, we have financing arrangements in place pursuant to which we purchase from our Issuing Banks participation interests in the accounts receivables generated when Divvy spending businesses make purchases using our cards. We typically fund some portion of these participation interest purchases by borrowing under credit facilities with our finance partners, although we may also fund participation purchases using corporate cash. Typically, we immediately sell a portion of the participation interests we have purchased to a warehousing subsidiary which funds the purchases through loans provided by our financing partners, and we may sell a portion of the participation interests to a third-party institution pursuant to a purchase arrangements. \nIf our finance partners terminate or interrupt their financing or purchase of participation interests or are unable to offer terms which are acceptable to us, we may have to fund these purchases using corporate cash, which we have a limited ability to do and may place significant stress on our cash resources. An inability to purchase participation interests from our Issuing Banks, whether funded through financing or corporate cash, could result in the banks\u2019 limiting extensions of credit to spending businesses or ceasing to extend credit for our cards altogether, which would interrupt or limit our ability to offer our card products and materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot guarantee that these funding arrangements will continue to be available on favorable terms or at all, and our funding strategy may change over time, depending on the availability of such funding arrangements. In addition, our funding sources may curtail access to uncommitted financing capacity, fail to renew or extend facilities, or impose higher costs to access funding upon reassessing their exposure to our industry or in light of changes to general economic, market, credit, or liquidity conditions. Further, our funding \n27\nsources may experience financial distress, enter into receivership, or become insolvent, which may prevent us from accessing financing from these sources. In addition, because our borrowings under current and future financing facilities may bear interest based on floating rate interest rates, our interest costs may increase if market interest rates rise. Moreover, there can be no assurances that we would be able to extend or replace our existing funding arrangements at maturity, on reasonable terms, or at all. \nIf our existing funding arrangements are not renewed or replaced or our existing funding sources are unwilling or unable to provide funding to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all, we may need to secure additional sources of funding or reduce our spend and expense management operations significantly. Further, as the volume of credit facilitated through our platform increases, we may need to expand the funding capacity under our existing funding arrangements or add new sources of capital. The availability and diversity of our funding arrangements depends on various factors and are subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. If we are unable to maintain access to, or to expand, our network and diversity of funding arrangements, our business, operating results, financial condition, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we do not or cannot maintain the compatibility of our platform with popular accounting software solutions or offerings of our partners, our revenue and growth prospects will decline.\nTo deliver a comprehensive solution, our platform integrates with popular accounting software solutions including Intuit QuickBooks, Oracle NetSuite, Sage Intacct, Xero, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, through APIs made available by these software providers. We automatically synchronize certain data between our platform and these accounting software systems relating to invoices and payment transactions between our customers and their suppliers and clients. This two-way sync saves time for our customers by reducing duplicative manual data entry and provides the basis for managing cash-flow through an integrated solution for accounts payable, accounts receivable, spend and expense management, and payments.\nIf any of the accounting software providers change the features of their APIs, discontinue their support of such APIs, restrict our access to their APIs, or alter the terms or practices\n \ngoverning their use in a manner that is adverse to our business, we may be restricted or may not be able to provide synchronization capabilities, which could significantly diminish the value of our platform and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, if any of these accounting software providers reconfigure their platforms in a manner that no longer supports our integration with their accounting software, we would lose customers and our business would be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to increase adoption of our platform with customers of these accounting software solutions, our growth prospects may be adversely affected. In addition, any of these accounting software providers may seek to develop a payment solution of its own, acquire a solution to compete with ours, or decide to partner with other competing applications, any of which its SMB customers may select over ours, thereby harming our growth prospects and reputation and adversely affecting our business and operating results.\nWe depend on third-party service providers to process transactions on our platform and to provide other services important to the operation of our business. Any significant disruption in services provided by these vendors could prevent us from processing transactions on our platform, result in other interruptions to our business and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe depend on banks, including JPMorgan Chase, to process ACH transactions and checks for our customers. We also rely on third-party providers to support other aspects of our business, including, for example, for card transaction processing, check printing, real-time payments, virtual and physical card issuance, and our cross-border funds transfer capabilities. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, we are unable to comply with security, compliance, or operational obligations to which we are subject under agreements with these providers, these providers are unable to meet their obligations to us, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships, including as a result of the closure or insolvency of banks with which we do business, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, in some cases a provider may be the sole source, or one of a limited number of sources, of the services they provide to us and we may experience increased costs and difficulties in replacing those providers and replacement services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, on a timely basis, or at all.\n28\nInterruptions or delays in the services provided by AWS or other third-party data centers or internet service providers could impair the delivery of our platform and our business could suffer.\nWe host our platform using third-party cloud infrastructure services, including certain co-location facilities. We also use public cloud hosting with Amazon Web Services (AWS). All of our products utilize resources operated by us through these providers. We therefore depend on our third-party cloud providers\u2019 ability to protect their data centers against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts, and similar events. Our operations depend on protecting the cloud infrastructure hosted by such providers by maintaining their respective configuration, architecture, and interconnection specifications, as well as the information stored in these virtual data centers and transmitted by third-party internet service providers. We have periodically experienced service disruptions in the past, and we cannot assure you that we will not experience interruptions or delays in our service in the future. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the data storage services we use. Although we have disaster recovery plans that utilize multiple data storage locations, any incident affecting their infrastructure that may be caused by fire, flood, severe storm, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses and disabling devices, natural disasters, military actions, terrorist attacks, negligence, and other similar events beyond our control could negatively affect our platform. Any prolonged service disruption affecting our platform for any of the foregoing reasons could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers, or otherwise harm our business. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. System failures or outages, including any potential disruptions due to significantly increased global demand on certain cloud-based systems, could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business or delay our financial reporting. Such failures could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur platform is accessed by many customers, often at the same time. As we continue to expand the number of our customers and products available to our customers, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate the increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. In addition, the failure of data centers, internet service providers, or other third-party service providers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions or delays in access to our platform or impede our ability to grow our business and scale our operations. If our third-party infrastructure service agreements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, interruption of internet service provider connectivity, or damage to data centers, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services\nMoreover, we are in the process of migrating our systems from internal data centers and smaller vendors to AWS. AWS provides us with computing and storage capacity pursuant to an agreement that continues until terminated by either party. We have a limited history of operating on AWS. As we migrate our data from our servers to AWS\u2019 servers, we may experience some duplication and incur additional costs. If our data migration is not successful, or if AWS unexpectedly terminates our agreement, we would be forced to incur additional expenses to locate an alternative provider and may experience outages or disruptions to our service. Any service disruption affecting our platform during such migration or while operating on the AWS cloud infrastructure could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers, or otherwise harm our business.\nIf we lose our founder or key members of our management team or are unable to attract and retain executives and employees we need to support our operations and growth, our business may be harmed.\nOur success and future growth depend upon the continued services of our management team and other key employees. Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Ren\u00e9 Lacerte, is critical to our overall management, as well as the continued development of our products, our partnerships, our culture, our relationships with accounting firms, and our strategy. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives and key employees, which could disrupt our business. In addition, we may face challenges retaining senior management of acquired businesses. Our senior management and key employees are employed on an at-will basis. We currently do not have \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our employees. Certain of our key employees have been with us for a long period of time and have fully vested \n29\nstock options or other long-term equity incentives that may become valuable and are publicly tradable. The loss of our founder, or one or more of our senior management, key members of senior management of acquired companies or other key employees could harm our business, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees or that we would be able to timely replace members of our senior management or other key employees should any of them depart.\nIn addition, to execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing, and managing cloud-based software and payments systems, as well as for skilled legal and compliance and risk operations professionals. Competition for software developers, compliance and risk management personnel, and other key employees in our industry and locations is intense and increasing and may be exacerbated in tight labor markets. We may also face increased competition for personnel from other companies which adopt approaches to remote work that differ from ours. In addition, the current regulatory environment related to immigration is uncertain, including with respect to the availability of H1-B and other visas. If a new or revised visa program is implemented, it may impact our ability to recruit, hire, retain, or effectively collaborate with qualified skilled personnel, including in the areas of AI and machine learning, and payment systems and risk management, which could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we do and can frequently offer such personnel substantially greater compensation than we can offer. If we fail to identify, attract, develop, and integrate new personnel, or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our growth prospects would be adversely affected.\nFuture acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, collaborations, or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have in the past and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For example, in November 2022 we completed the acquisition of Finmark Financial, Inc. to augment our financial planning product offerings. However, we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses, and we may not successfully identify desirable acquisition targets in the future. Moreover, an acquisition, investment, or business relationship may not further our business strategy or result in the economic benefits or synergies as expected or may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including disrupting our ongoing operations, diverting management from their primary responsibilities, subjecting us to additional liabilities, increasing our expenses, and adversely impacting our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, the technology and information security systems and infrastructure of businesses we acquire may be underdeveloped or subject to vulnerabilities, subjecting us to additional liabilities. We could incur significant costs related to the implementation of enhancements to or the scaling of information security systems and infrastructure of acquired businesses and related to the remediation of any related security breaches. If security, data protection, and information security measures in place at businesses we acquire are inadequate or breached, or are subject to cybersecurity attacks, or if any of the foregoing is reported or perceived to have occurred, our reputation and business could be damaged and we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, proceedings, and penalties. We may also acquire businesses whose operations may not be fully compliant with all applicable law, including economic and trade sanctions and anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and privacy laws, subjecting us to potential liabilities and requiring us to spend considerable time, effort, and resources to address.\nMoreover, we may acquire businesses whose management or compliance functions require significant investments to support current and anticipated future product offerings, or that have underdeveloped internal control infrastructures or procedures or with respect to which we discover significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. The costs that we may incur to implement or improve such functions, controls, and procedures may be substantial and we could encounter unexpected delays and challenges related to such activity.\nGiven the complexity of our platform and the distinct interface and tools that we offer to our accounting firm partners and financial institution partners, it may be critical that certain businesses or technologies that we acquire be successfully and fully integrated into our platform. In addition, some acquisitions may require us to \n30\nspend considerable time, effort, and resources to integrate employees from the acquired business into our teams, and acquisitions of companies in lines of business in which we lack expertise may require considerable management time, oversight, and research before we see the desired benefit of such acquisitions. Therefore, we may be exposed to unknown liabilities and the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, or business relationship may not be realized, if, for example, we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company. The challenges and costs of integrating and achieving anticipated synergies and benefits of transactions, and the risk that the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction may not be fully realized or take longer to realize than expected, may be compounded where we attempt to integrate multiple acquired businesses within similar timeframes, as was the case with the concurrent integration efforts related to our acquisitions of the Divvy and Invoice2go businesses.\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, as well as unfavorable accounting treatment and exposure to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims. We also may not generate sufficient financial returns to offset the costs and expenses related to any acquisitions. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, operating results, and financial condition may suffer.\nIf we fail to offer high-quality customer support, or if our support is more expensive than anticipated, our business and reputation could suffer.\nOur customers rely on our customer support services to resolve issues and realize the full benefits provided by our platform, as well as to understand and fully utilize the growing suite of products we offer. A range of high-quality support options is critical for the renewal and expansion of our subscriptions with existing customers: we provide customer support via chat, email, and phone through a combination of AI-assisted interactions with the BILL Virtual Assistant as well as robust support from a highly trained staff of customer success personnel. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, or if our support personnel or methods of providing support are insufficient to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to retain customers, increase adoption by our existing customers, and acquire new customers could suffer, and our reputation with existing or potential customers could be harmed. If we are not able to meet the customer support needs of our customers during the hours that we currently provide support, we may need to increase our support coverage or provide additional support, which may reduce our profitability.\nIf we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changing regulations, and changing business needs, requirements, or preferences, our products may become less competitive.\nThe market for SMB software financial back-office solutions is relatively new and subject to ongoing technological change, evolving industry standards, payment methods, and changing regulations, as well as changing customer needs, requirements, and preferences. The success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to adapt and respond effectively to these changes on a timely basis, including launching new products and services. In addition, the market for our spend and expense management solution is new and fragmented, and it is uncertain whether we will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market adoption. The success of any new product and service, or any enhancements or modifications to existing products and services, depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products and services, enhancements, and modifications. If we are unable to enhance our platform, add new payment methods, or develop new products that keep pace with technological and regulatory change and achieve market acceptance, or if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver competitive products and services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently, or more securely than our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected. Furthermore, modifications to our existing platform or technology will increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with existing or future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer or spending business dissatisfaction, and adversely affect our business.\nIf the prices we charge for our services are unacceptable to our customers, our operating results will be harmed.\n31\nWe generate revenue by charging customers a fixed monthly rate per user for subscriptions as well as transaction fees. As the market for our platform matures, or as new or existing competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may experience pricing pressure and be unable to renew our agreements with existing customers or attract new customers at prices that are consistent with our pricing model and operating budget. Our pricing strategy for new products we introduce and existing products we continue to offer may prove to be unappealing to our customers, and our competitors could choose to bundle certain products and services competitive with ours. If this were to occur, it is possible that we would have to change our pricing strategies or reduce our prices, which could harm our revenue, gross profits, and operating results.\nWe typically provide service level commitments under our financial institution partner agreements. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services or face contract terminations, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nOur agreements with our financial institution partners typically contain service level commitments evaluated on a monthly basis. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide these partners with service credits, up to 10% of the partner\u2019s subscription fees for the month in which the service level was not met. In addition, we could face contract terminations, in which case we would be subject to refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services. Our revenue could be significantly affected if we suffer unexcused downtime under our agreements with our partners. Further, any extended service outages could adversely affect our reputation, revenue, and operating results.\nWe may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet our customers\u2019 growing needs, and if we are not able to grow efficiently, our operating results could be harmed.\nAs usage of our platform grows and we sign additional partners, we will need to devote additional resources to improving and maintaining our infrastructure and computer network and integrating with third-party applications to maintain the performance of our platform. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support, risk and compliance operations, and professional services, to serve our growing customer base.\nAny failure of or delay in these efforts could result in service interruptions, impaired system performance, and reduced customer satisfaction, resulting in decreased sales to new customers, lower subscription renewal rates by existing customers, the issuance of service credits, or requested refunds, all of which could hurt our revenue growth. If sustained or repeated, these performance issues could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to customers and could result in lost customer opportunities and lower renewal rates, any of which could hurt our revenue growth, customer loyalty, and our reputation. Even if we are successful in these efforts to scale our business, they will be expensive and complex, and require the dedication of significant management time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies or service disruptions as a result of our efforts to scale our internal infrastructure. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our internal infrastructure will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all, and such failures could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFailure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products.\nOur ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our sales and marketing organizations, and to deploy our sales and marketing resources efficiently. Although we will adjust our sales and marketing spend levels as needed in response to changes in the economic environment, we plan to continue expanding our direct-to-SMB sales force as well as our sales force focused on identifying new partnership opportunities. We also dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including digital advertising through services such as Google AdWords. The effectiveness and cost of our online advertising has varied over time and may vary in the future due to competition for key search terms, changes in search engine use, and changes in the search algorithms used by major search engines. These efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. \n32\nIn addition, our ability to broaden the spending business base for our Divvy spend and expense management offerings and achieve broader market acceptance of these products will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our sales and marketing organizations to work together to drive our sales pipeline and cultivate spending business and partner relationships to drive revenue growth. If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop, and retain talented sales or marketing personnel, if our new sales or marketing personnel and partners are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective, our ability to broaden our spending business base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform could be harmed. Moreover, our Divvy marketing efforts depend significantly on our ability to call on our current spending businesses to provide positive references to new, potential spending business customers. Given our limited number of long-term spending businesses, the loss or dissatisfaction of any spending business could substantially harm our brand and reputation, inhibit the market adoption of our offering, and impair our ability to attract new spending businesses and maintain existing spending businesses.\nOur business and operating results will be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts do not generate significant increases in revenue. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate, and retain talented and effective sales personnel, if our new and existing sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales and marketing programs and advertising are not effective.\nWe currently handle cross-border payments and plan to expand our payments offerings to new customers and to make payments to new countries, creating a variety of operational challenges.\nA component of our growth strategy involves our cross-border payments product and, ultimately, expanding our operations internationally. Although we do not currently offer our payments products to customers outside the U.S., starting in 2018, we introduced cross-border payments, and now, working with two international payment services, offer our U.S.-based customers the ability to disburse funds to over 130 countries. We are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address payments to new countries. However, there is no guarantee that such efforts will have the desired effect.\nOur cross-border payments product and international expansion strategy involve a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022\ncomplying with financial regulations and our ability to comply and obtain any relevant licenses in applicable countries or jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and our cross-border payments providers' ability to provide us favorable currency exchange rates, which may impact our revenues and expenses; \n\u2022\nreduction or cessation in cross-border trade resulting from government sanctions, trade tariffs or restrictions, other trade regulations or strained international relations;\n\u2022\npotential application of more stringent regulations relating to privacy, information protection, and data security, and the authorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information;\n\u2022\nsanctions imposed by applicable government authorities or jurisdictions, such as OFAC, or comparable authorities in other countries;\n\u2022\nexposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), U.S. bribery laws, the UK Bribery Act, and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; \n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tax laws; and\n\u2022\ncessation of business of a cross-border payment service provider or other limitation or inability of a cross-border payment service provider to make payments into certain countries, including for the reasons set forth above.\nIf we invest substantial time and resources to further expand our cross-border payments offering and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results may suffer.\n33\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from interchange revenue, which exposes us to potential variability in income and other risks. \nCertain of our products, including our Divvy charge card and our virtual card products, generate revenue primarily from interchange paid by the supplier accepting the cards for purchase transactions. Interchange revenue comprises a substantial portion of our total revenue. The amount of  interchange fees we earn is highly dependent upon the interchange rates set by the third-party  card networks and, from time to time, card networks change the interchange fees and assessments they charge for transactions processed using their networks. In addition, interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry.\nInterchange revenue involves a variety of risks, including: \n\u2022\ninterchange revenue fluctuations due to the variability of card acceptance practices at supplier locations, and the resulting effect on our revenue;\n\u2022\nchanges in card network interchange rates or rules which could dissuade new and existing card-accepting suppliers from continuing to accept card payments;\n\u2022\nunexpected compliance and risk management imposed by the card networks or resulting from changes in regulation;\n\u2022\ndeclines in the number of active card-accepting suppliers due to concerns about cost or operational complexity; and\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in card acceptance or card issuing rules which may impact our ability to offer this payment product.\nAny of these developments could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our business, operating results, and financial condition may suffer.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands are important to support the marketing and sale of our existing and future products to new customers and partners and to expand sales of our platforms to new and existing customers and partners. Our ability to protect our BILL brand is limited as a result of its descriptive nature. Successfully maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing and demand generation efforts, our ability to provide reliable products that continue to meet the needs of our customers at competitive prices, our ability to maintain our customers\u2019 trust, our ability to continue to develop new functionality and products, and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform and products from competitive products and services. Our brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands, our business could suffer.\nChanges to payment card networks rules or fees could harm our business.\nWe are required to comply with the Mastercard, American Express, and Visa payment card network operating rules applicable to our card products. We have agreed to reimburse certain service providers for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us. We may also be directly liable to the payment card networks for rule violations. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. We also may seek to introduce other card-related products in the future, which would entail compliance with additional operating rules. As a result of any violations of rules, new rules being implemented, or increased fees, we could be hindered or lose our ability to provide our card products, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, we are contractually obligated to comply with MasterCard and Visa network rules as a card program manager. As a result of any violations of these rules or new rules being implemented, we could lose our ability or rights to act as a card program manager. \n34\nWe may require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity and debt financings, sales of subscriptions to our products, usage-based transaction fees and interest earned on customer funds. We cannot be certain when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fully fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business, which may require us to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. We may also seek to raise additional capital from equity or debt financings on an opportunistic basis when we believe there are suitable opportunities for doing so. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. If we incur additional debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to holders of common stock to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity securities, including in connection with merger and acquisition transactions, stockholders will experience dilution. In addition, new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. During fiscal 2023, interest rates  increased and the trading prices for our common stock and other technology companies have been highly volatile, which may reduce our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. More recently, credit and capital markets have been impacted by instability in the U.S. banking system. In addition, a recession or depression, high inflation, or other sustained adverse market event could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in the future will depend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future issuances of debt or equity securities. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of our common stock and diluting their interests.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, we had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $1.4\u00a0billion, $1.1\u00a0billion, and $83.4 million for federal, state, and foreign tax purposes, respectively, that are available to reduce future taxable income. If not utilized, the state NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025. As of June\u00a030, 2023, the federal and foreign NOL carryforwards do not expire and will carry forward indefinitely until utilized. As of June\u00a030, 2023, we also had research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $56.1 million and $35.6 million for federal and state tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal tax credits will expire at various dates beginning in 2039. The state tax credits do not expire and will carry forward indefinitely until utilized. In general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset future taxable income or income tax. If it is determined that we have in the past experienced an ownership change, or if we undergo one or more ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock, then our ability to utilize NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes could be limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Sections 382 or 383 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs, even if we were to achieve profitability.\n \nIn addition, any future changes in tax laws could impact our ability to utilize NOLs in future years and may result in greater tax liabilities than we would otherwise incur and adversely affect our cash flows and financial position.\nWe could be required to collect additional sales taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the costs our customers would have to pay for our offering and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe vast majority of states have considered or adopted laws that impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. States where we have nexus may require us to calculate, collect, and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdiction. Additionally, the Supreme Court of the U.S. recently ruled in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al (Wayfair) that online sellers can be required to collect sales and use tax despite not having a physical presence in the buyer\u2019s state. In response to Wayfair, or otherwise, states or local governments may enforce laws requiring us to calculate, collect, and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdictions. We may be obligated to \n35\ncollect and remit sales and use taxes in states where we have not collected and remitted sales and use taxes. A successful assertion by one or more states requiring us to collect taxes where we historically have not or presently do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest. The imposition by state governments or local governments of sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers could also create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a perceived competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on our competitors, and decrease our future sales, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nChanges in our effective tax rate or tax liability may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur effective tax rate could increase due to several factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various U.S. and international jurisdictions in which we operate due to differing statutory tax rates in various jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, tax treaties, and regulations or the interpretation of them, including the 2017 Tax Act as modified by the CARES Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022;\n\u2022\nchanges to our assessment about our ability to realize our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals; and\n\u2022\nlimitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.\nAny of these developments could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe use artificial intelligence in our business, and challenges with properly managing its use could result in reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe currently leverage AI into certain aspects of our platform, such as prepopulating invoices based on the historical behavior of businesses using our solutions and modeling businesses' creditworthiness and offering them and their counterparties expedited means of payment. Moving forward, we anticipate that AI will become increasingly important to our platform. Our competitors and other third parties may incorporate AI into their products and offerings more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, if the content, analyses, or recommendations that AI applications assist in producing are or are alleged to be inaccurate, deficient, or biased, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. The use of AI applications has resulted in, and may in the future result in, cybersecurity incidents that implicate the personal data of customers analyzed within such applications. Any such cybersecurity incidents related to our use of AI applications to analysis personal data could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. AI also presents emerging ethical issues and if our use of AI becomes controversial, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability. The rapid evolution of AI, including potential government regulation of AI and it various uses, will require significant resources to develop, test and maintain our platform, offerings, services, and features to help us implement AI ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact.\nNatural catastrophic events, pandemics, and man-made problems such as power-disruptions, computer viruses, data security breaches, war, and terrorism may disrupt our business.\nNatural disasters, pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, other catastrophic events, and man-made problems, such as terrorism, war, or economic or trade sanctions related to war (including the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine), may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce, and the global economy, and thus could harm our business. We have a large employee presence in the San Francisco Bay Area in California, Draper, Utah, Houston, Texas and Sydney, Australia, and our data centers are located in California and Arizona. The west coast of the U.S. contains active earthquake zones and is subject to frequent wildfire outbreaks, the Houston area frequently experiences significant hurricanes and Sydney also frequently experiences wildfires. In the event of a major earthquake, hurricane, or catastrophic event such as fire, flooding, power loss, telecommunications failure, vandalism, cyber-attack, war, or terrorist attack, we may \n36\nbe unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our application development, lengthy interruptions in our products, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data, all of which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, data centers depend on predictable and reliable energy and networking capabilities, which could be affected by a variety of factors, including climate change.\nAdditionally, as computer malware, viruses, and computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts, and phishing attacks have become more prevalent, we, and third parties upon which we rely, face increased risk in maintaining the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our solutions and related services and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our customers. Any computer malware, viruses, computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts, phishing attacks, or other data security breaches related to our network infrastructure or information technology systems or to computer hardware we lease from third parties, could, among other things, harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers.\nIn addition, the insurance we maintain may be insufficient to cover our losses resulting from disasters, cyber-attacks, or other business interruptions, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased costs of, such insurance.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. Sarbanes-Oxley requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. It may require significant resources and management oversight to maintain and, if necessary, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which would increase our costs and expenses. \nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley (Section 404), to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nThis assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires our independent registered public accounting firm to annually attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which has, and will continue to, require increased costs, expenses, and management resources. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead us to restate our financial statements, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock, and result in additional costs to remediate such material weaknesses. We are required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring accounting or internal audit staff. For example, in May 2023, we concluded that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of \n37\nJune 30, 2022, as a result of insufficient testing, documentation, and evidence retention related to certain information systems and applications within the quote-to-cash process. While this material weakness was remediated as of June 30, 2023, there can be no assurance that we will not have material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm issues an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported operating results and financial condition and could affect the reporting of transactions already completed before the announcement of a change.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled \u201c\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operating Results\u2014Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\n\u201d The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant estimates and judgments may involve the variable consideration used in revenue recognition for certain contracts, determination of useful lives of long-lived intangible assets, present value estimation of operating lease liabilities, the estimate of losses on accounts receivable, acquired card receivables and other financial assets, accrual for rewards, inputs used to value certain stock-based compensation awards, benefit period to amortize deferred costs and valuation of income taxes. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nOur estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts, including those we have generated ourselves, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The variables that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no guarantee that any particular number or percentage of addressable users or companies covered by our market opportunity estimates will purchase our products at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Any expansion in the markets in which we operate depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our platforms and those of our competitors. Even if the markets in which we compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasted, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, our forecasts of market growth should not be taken as indicative of our future growth. \nWe rely on assumptions and estimates to calculate certain of our performance metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\n38\nWe calculate and track certain customer and other performance metrics with internal tools, which are not independently verified by any third party. While we believe our metrics are reasonable estimates of our customer base and payment and transaction volumes for the applicable period of measurement, the methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and may be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. For example, the accuracy and consistency of our performance metrics may be impacted by changes to internal assumptions regarding how we account for and track customers, limitations on system implementations, and limitations on the ability of third-party tools to match our database. If the internal tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data (or the data that we measure) may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our longer-term strategies. Further, as our business develops, we may revise or cease reporting certain metrics if we determine that such metrics are no longer accurate or appropriate measures of our performance. If our performance metrics are not accurate representations of our business, customer base, or payment or transaction volumes, if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, or if the metrics we rely on to track our performance do not provide an accurate measurement of our business, our reputation may be harmed, we may be subject to legal or regulatory actions, and our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nAny future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nWe have in the past and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims made by our current or former employees, or claims for reimbursement following misappropriation of customer data. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which might seriously harm our business, overall financial condition, and operating results. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, which could reduce the trading price of our stock.\nIf we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, our success and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe our culture has been a key contributor to our success to date and that the critical nature of the platform that we provide promotes a sense of greater purpose and fulfillment in our employees. Inorganic growth through mergers and acquisitions may pose significant challenges to assimilating the company cultures of acquired companies. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, which is critical to our growth, and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. As we grow and develop the infrastructure of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our culture. If we fail to maintain our company culture, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk relating to our Australian operations.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk relating to our Australian operations and Australian subsidiary. A change in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in Australian dollars to U.S. dollars, can affect our financial results due to transaction gains or losses related to the remeasurement of certain monetary asset and monetary liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, which is the functional currency of our Australian subsidiary. In addition, we expect our exposure to foreign currency rate risks in the future to increase as our international operations increase.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Privacy Matters\nPayments and other financial services-related regulations and oversight are material to our business. Our failure to comply could materially harm our business.\nThe local, state, and federal laws, rules, regulations, licensing requirements, and industry standards that govern our business include, or may in the future include, those relating to banking, deposit-taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, foreign exchange, payments services (such as licensed money \n39\ntransmission, payment processing, and settlement services), lending, anti-money laundering, combating terrorist financing, escheatment, international sanctions regimes, and compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, a set of requirements designed to ensure that all companies that process, store, or transmit payment card information maintain a secure environment to protect spending business data. In addition, Divvy is required to maintain loan brokering or servicing licenses in a number of U.S. states in which it conducts business and is contractually obligated to comply with FDIC federal banking regulations, as well as Visa and MasterCard network rules as a card program manager. These laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and standards are enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the U.S., including the Department of the Treasury, the FDIC, the SEC, self-regulatory organizations, and numerous state and local agencies. As we expand into new jurisdictions, the number of foreign laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and standards governing our business will expand as well. In addition, as our business and products continue to develop and expand, we may become subject to additional laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and standards. We may not always be able to accurately predict the scope or applicability of certain laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, or standards to our business, particularly as we expand into new areas of operations, which could have a significant negative effect on our existing business and our ability to pursue future plans.\nSeveral of our subsidiaries maintain licenses to operate in regulated businesses in U.S. states and other countries.  Our subsidiary, Bill.com, LLC, maintains licenses, as applicable, to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the U.S., the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and, to the best of our knowledge, in all the states where such licensure or registration is required for our business. In addition, our subsidiary, Bill.com Canada, LLC is a Foreign Money Services Business in Canada and the regulations applicable to our activity in Canada are enforced by FINTRAC and Quebec\u2019s Financial Markets Authority. As a licensed money transmitter in the U.S., we are subject to obligations and restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, minimum capital requirements, and examinations by state and federal regulatory agencies concerning various aspects of our business. As a licensed Foreign Money Services business in Canada, we are subject to Canadian compliance regulations applicable to money movement and sanctions requirements. In addition, our DivvyPay, LLC subsidiary holds brokering and servicing licenses required in connection with our Divvy card offering, and certain of our other subsidiaries hold loan brokering and servicing licenses as well.  \nEvaluation of our compliance efforts in the U.S. and Canada, as well as questions as to whether and to what extent our products and services are considered money transmission, are matters of regulatory interpretation and could change over time. In the past, we have been subject to fines and other penalties by regulatory authorities for violations of state money transmission laws. Regulators and third-party auditors have also identified gaps in our anti-money laundering and sanctions program, which we have addressed through remediation processes. In the future, as a result of the regulations applicable to our business, we could be subject to investigations and resulting liability, including governmental fines, restrictions on our business, or other sanctions, and we could be forced to cease conducting certain aspects of our business with residents of certain jurisdictions, be forced to change our business practices in certain jurisdictions, or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any such licenses, and, even if we were able to do so, there could be substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining and renewing such licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance, or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose substantial additional costs, involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services, require significant and costly operational changes, or prevent us from providing our products or services in any given market.\nGovernment agencies may impose new or additional rules on money transmission, including regulations that:\n\u2022\nprohibit, restrict, and/or impose taxes or fees on money transmission transactions in, to, or from certain countries or with certain governments, individuals, and entities;\n\u2022\nimpose additional customer and spending business identification and customer or spending business due diligence requirements;\n40\n\u2022\nimpose additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements, or require enhanced transaction monitoring;\n\u2022\nlimit the types of entities capable of providing money transmission services, or impose additional licensing or registration requirements;\n\u2022\nimpose minimum capital or other financial requirements;\n\u2022\nlimit or restrict the revenue that may be generated from money transmission, including revenue from interest earned on customer funds, transaction fees, and revenue derived from foreign exchange;\n\u2022\nrequire enhanced disclosures to our money transmission customers;\n\u2022\nrequire the principal amount of money transmission originated in a country to be invested in that country or held in trust until paid;\n\u2022\nlimit the number or principal amount of money transmission transactions that may be sent to or from a jurisdiction, whether by an individual or in the aggregate; and\n\u2022\nrestrict or limit our ability to process transactions using centralized databases, for example, by requiring that transactions be processed using a database maintained in a particular country or region.\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business.\nOur success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and enforcement and more restrictive rules and regulations that apply to our business. We are subject to a wide variety of local, state, federal, and international laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate and in many of the approximately 150 countries in which Invoice2go has subscribers. These laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and standards govern numerous areas that are important to our business. In addition to the payments and financial services-related regulations, and the privacy, data protection, and information security-related laws described elsewhere in this \"\nRisk Factors\n\" section our business is also subject to, without limitation, rules and regulations applicable to: securities, labor and employment, immigration, competition, and marketing and communications practices. Laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and standards applicable to our business are subject to change and evolving interpretations and application, including by means of legislative changes and/or executive orders, and it can be difficult to predict how they may be applied to our business and the way we conduct our operations, particularly as we introduce new products and services and expand into new jurisdictions. We may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to regulatory, legislative, and other developments, and these changes may in turn impair our ability to offer our existing or planned features, products, and services and/or increase our cost of doing business.\nAlthough we have a compliance program focused on the laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards that we have assessed as applicable to our business and we are continually investing more in this program, there can be no assurance that our employees or contractors will not violate such laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, industry standards, or orders of any governmental authority (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws, regulations, standards, or orders), may:\n\u2022\nsubject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, license suspension or revocation, forfeiture of significant assets, audits, inquiries, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions levied by federal, state, local, or foreign regulators, state attorneys general, and private plaintiffs who may be acting as private attorneys general pursuant to various applicable federal, state, and local laws;\n\u2022\nresult in additional compliance and licensure requirements;\n41\n\u2022\nincrease regulatory scrutiny of our business; and\n\u2022\nrestrict our operations and force us to change our business practices or compliance program, make product or operational changes, or delay planned product launches or improvements.\nThe complexity of U.S. federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the scope of our international operations and the evolving regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to many overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions.\nAny of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation as a trusted provider, damage our brands and business, cause us to lose existing customers, prevent us from obtaining new customers, require us to expend significant funds to remedy problems caused by breaches and to avert further breaches, expose us to legal risk and potential liability, and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly those related to privacy, data protection, and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business, by resulting in litigation, fines, penalties, or adverse publicity and reputational damage that may negatively affect the value of our business and decrease the price of our common stock. Compliance with such laws could also result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our products.\nOur customers, their suppliers, and other users store personal and business information, financial information, and other sensitive information on our platform. In addition, we receive, store, and process personal and business information and other data from and about actual and prospective customers and users, in addition to our employees and service providers. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, such as the FTC, and various state, local, and foreign agencies. Our data handling also is subject to contractual obligations and industry standards.\nThe U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use, and storage of data relating to individuals and businesses, including the use of contact information and other data for marketing, advertising, and other communications with individuals and businesses. In the U.S., various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, disclosure, and security of certain types of data, including the Gramm Leach Bliley Act and state laws relating to privacy and data security. Additionally, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. For example, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which became operative on January 1, 2020 and broadly defines personal information, gives California residents expanded privacy rights and protections, and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. The CCPA was amended several times after its enactment, most recently by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which, as of its effective date of January 1, 2023, gives California residents expanded privacy rights, including the right to opt out of certain personal information sharing, the use of \u201csensitive personal information,\u201d and the use of personal information for automated decision-making or targeted advertising. The CCPA and CPRA provide for civil penalties and a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Many aspects of the CCPA, the CPRA, and their interpretation remain unclear, and their full impact on our business and operations remains uncertain. Following the lead of California, several other states, including Colorado, Utah, Virginia, and Connecticut have each enacted laws similar to the CCPA/CPRA and other states are considering enacting privacy laws as well. Accordingly, the laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security are evolving, can be subject to significant change, and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions.\nIn addition, several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK), have laws and regulations dealing with the handling and processing of personal information obtained from their residents, which in certain cases are more restrictive than those in the U.S. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure, and security of various types of data, including data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, email addresses, and in some jurisdictions, internet protocol addresses. Our current and prospective service offerings subject us to the EU's GDPR, the UK GDPR, Australian and Canadian privacy laws, and the privacy \n42\nlaws of many other foreign jurisdictions. Such laws and regulations may be modified or subject to new or different interpretations, and new laws and regulations may be enacted in the future.\nFor example, the GDPR and the UK GDPR impose stringent operational requirements for controllers and processors of personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area and the UK, respectively, and non-compliance can trigger robust regulatory enforcement and fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues. Among other requirements, these laws regulate transfers of personal data to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States. The efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms between the EU or the UK and the United States remains uncertain. Violations of the GDPR or the UK GDPR may also lead to damages claims by data controllers and data subjects, in addition to civil litigation claims by data controllers, customers, and data subjects.\nThe scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting as a result of the rapidly evolving regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide. For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. As a result of the laws that are or may be applicable to us, and due to the sensitive nature of the information we collect, we have implemented policies and procedures to preserve and protect our data and our customers\u2019 data against loss, misuse, corruption, misappropriation caused by systems failures, or unauthorized access. If our policies, procedures, or measures relating to privacy, data protection, information security, marketing, or customer communications fail to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal obligations, or industry standards, we may be subject to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, regulatory investigations, fines, penalties, and negative publicity, and it could cause our application providers, customers, and partners to lose trust in us, and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that may apply to us. Because the interpretation and application of privacy, data protection and information security laws, regulations, rules, and other standards are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws, rules, regulations, and other actual or alleged legal obligations, such as contractual or self-regulatory obligations, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the functionality of our platform. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our software, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal, or contractual obligations, industry standards, or regulatory guidance relating to privacy, data protection, or information security, may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties, or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers and partners to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, and industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, information security, marketing, and consumer communications, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations, and standards may have on our business. Future laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations or any changed interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impair our ability to develop and market new functionality and maintain and grow our customer base and increase revenue. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing, or disclosure of data, or additional requirements for express or implied consent of our customers, partners, or users for the use and disclosure of such information could require us to incur additional costs or modify our platform, possibly in a material manner, and could limit our ability to develop new functionality.\nIf we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations, or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, our business, financial condition, or reputation could be harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain products, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect the growth of our business. Furthermore, any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our operating results.\n43\nWe, our partners, our customers, and others who use our services obtain and process a large amount of sensitive data. Any real or perceived improper or unauthorized use of, disclosure of, or access to such data could harm our reputation as a trusted brand and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe, our partners, our customers, and the third-party vendors and data centers that we use, obtain and process large amounts of sensitive data, including data related to our customers and their transactions, as well as other data of the counterparties to their payments. We face risks, including to our reputation as a trusted brand, in the handling and protection of this data, and these risks will increase as our business continues to expand to include new products and technologies.\nCybersecurity incidents and malicious internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and providers of cloud-based services have frequently been targeted by such attacks. These cybersecurity challenges, including threats to our own information technology infrastructure or those of our customers or third-party providers, may take a variety of forms ranging from stolen bank accounts, business email compromise, customer employee fraud, account takeover, check fraud, or cybersecurity attacks, to \u201cmega breaches\u201d targeted against cloud-based services and other hosted software, which could be initiated by individual or groups of hackers or sophisticated cyber criminals. State-sponsored cybersecurity attacks on the U.S. financial system or U.S. financial service providers could also adversely affect our business. A cybersecurity incident or breach could result in disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property, or cause production downtimes and compromised data. We have in the past experienced cybersecurity incidents of limited scale. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent techniques used in the future to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems because they change frequently and often are not detected until after an incident has occurred. As we increase our customer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, third parties may increasingly seek to compromise our security controls or gain unauthorized access to our sensitive corporate information or our customers\u2019 data.\nWe have administrative, technical, and physical security measures in place, and we have policies and procedures in place to contractually require service providers to whom we disclose data to implement and maintain reasonable privacy, data protection, and information security measures. However, if our privacy protection, data protection, or information security measures or those of the previously mentioned third parties are inadequate or are breached as a result of third-party action, employee or contractor error, malfeasance, malware, phishing, hacking attacks, system error, software bugs, or defects in our products, trickery, process failure, or otherwise, and, as a result, there is improper disclosure of, or someone obtains unauthorized access to or exfiltrates funds or sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, on our systems or our partners\u2019 systems, or if we suffer a ransomware or advanced persistent threat attack, or if any of the foregoing is reported or perceived to have occurred, our reputation and business could be damaged. Recent high-profile security breaches and related disclosures of sensitive data by large institutions suggest that the risk of such events is significant, even if privacy, data protection, and information security measures are implemented and enforced. If sensitive information is lost or improperly disclosed or threatened to be disclosed, we could incur significant costs associated with remediation and the implementation of additional security measures, and may incur significant liability and financial loss, and be subject to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, proceedings, and penalties.\nIn addition, our financial institution partners conduct regular audits of our cybersecurity program, and if any of them were to conclude that our systems and procedures are insufficiently rigorous, they could terminate their relationships with us, and our financial results and business could be adversely affected. Under our terms of service and our contracts with certain partners, if there is a breach of payment information that we store, we could be liable to the partner for their losses and related expenses. Additionally, if our own confidential business information were improperly disclosed, our business could be materially and adversely affected. A core aspect of our business is the reliability and security of our platform. Any perceived or actual breach of security, regardless of how it occurs or the extent of the breach, could have a significant impact on our reputation as a trusted brand, cause us to lose existing partners or other customers, prevent us from obtaining new partners and other customers, require us to expend significant funds to remedy problems caused by breaches and implement measures to prevent further breaches, and expose us to legal risk and potential liability including those resulting from governmental or regulatory investigations, class action litigation, and costs associated with remediation, such as fraud monitoring and forensics. Any actual or perceived security breach at a company providing services to us or our customers could have similar effects. Further, as the COVID-19 pandemic and \n44\nensuing adoption of remote work has resulted in a significant number of people working from home, these cybersecurity risks may be heightened by an increased attack surface across our business and those of our partners and service providers. We have heightened monitoring in the face of such risks, but cannot guarantee that our efforts, or the efforts of those upon whom we rely and partner with, will be successful in preventing any such information security incidents.\nWhile we maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may be insufficient or may not cover all liabilities incurred by such attacks. We also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and reputation.\nWe are subject to governmental laws and requirements regarding economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terror financing that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to criminal or civil liability if we violate them.\nAlthough we currently only offer our payment and card products to customers in the U.S. and Canada, Invoice2go has international subscribers in approximately 150 countries, including Australia and several EU countries, for which payment activity is conducted through third-party payment providers. As we continue to expand internationally, we will become subject to additional laws and regulations, and will need to implement new regulatory controls to comply with applicable laws. We are currently required to comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by OFAC and we have processes in place to comply with the OFAC regulations as well as similar requirements in other jurisdictions, including the Australian Sanctions Regime, the Canadian Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act and, to the extent we expand our offerings into the UK and the EU, UK and EU money laundering directives. As part of our compliance efforts, we scan our customers against OFAC and other watch lists and have controls to monitor and mitigate these risks. If our services are accessed from a sanctioned country in violation of the trade and economic sanctions, we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action. We are also subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and around the world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities.\nIn the United States, most of our services are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the BSA and similar state laws and regulations. The BSA requires, among other things, MSBs to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, to report suspicious activity, and in some cases, to collect and maintain information about customers who use their services and maintain other transaction records. Regulators in the United States, Canada, Australia, and in many other foreign jurisdictions continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor transactions on our system, including payments to persons outside of the U.S., Canada, and Australia. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers, and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, U.S. domestic bribery laws, and other anti-corruption laws, including Australia\u2019s anti-bribery laws, the Canadian Criminal Code and the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, and their third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public sector. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. Although we currently only offer our payment and card products to customers in the U.S.,and payment services in Canada and the United Kingdom, Invoice2go has international subscribers in approximately 150 countries, including Australia and several EU countries for \n45\nwhich payment activity is conducted through third-party payment providers. As we increase our international cross-border business and expand operations abroad, we may engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market our services and obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. In addition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.\nWe cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we increase our international business, our risks under these laws may increase.\nDetecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-corruption laws can require a significant diversion of time, resources, and attention from senior management. In addition, noncompliance with anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, other civil or criminal penalties, injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas are received or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal proceeding, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate less revenue, and incur costly litigation to protect our rights.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws, and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. While we have been issued patents in the U.S. and have additional patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Any of our patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights may be challenged or circumvented by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. There can be no guarantee that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate any of our products, or design around our patents. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours.\nWe have been in the past, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly and may subject us to significant liability and increased costs of doing business.\nWe have been in the past and may in the future become subject to intellectual property disputes. Lawsuits are time-consuming and expensive to resolve and they divert management\u2019s time and attention. Although we carry insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. We cannot predict the outcome of lawsuits and cannot assure you that the results of any such actions will not have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.\nThe software industry is characterized by the existence of many patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual and proprietary rights. Companies in the software industry are often required to defend against litigation claims based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims against their use. In addition, many companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Any litigation may also involve patent holding \n46\ncompanies or other adverse patent owners that have no relevant product revenue, and therefore, our patents may provide little or no deterrence as we would not be able to assert them against such entities or individuals. If a third party is able to obtain an injunction preventing us from accessing such third-party intellectual property rights, or if we cannot license or develop alternative technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our software or cease business activities related to such intellectual property. Any inability to license third-party technology in the future would have an adverse effect on our business or operating results and would adversely affect our ability to compete. We may also be contractually obligated to indemnify our customers in the event of infringement of a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, costly to defend, and damaging to our reputation and brand.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, data protection, and other losses.\nOur agreements with financial institution partners and some larger customers include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, data protection, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our platform or other contractual obligations. Some of these indemnity agreements provide for uncapped liability and some indemnity provisions survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Although we normally limit our liability with respect to such obligations in our contracts with direct customers and with customers acquired through our accounting firm partners, we may still incur substantial liability, and we may be required to cease use of certain functions of our platform or products, as a result of intellectual property-related claims. Any dispute with a customer with respect to these obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing or new customers, and harm our business and operating results. In addition, although we carry insurance, our insurance may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed, or otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims alleging compromises of customer data, and any such coverage may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe use open source software in our products, which could subject us to litigation or other actions.\nWe use open source software in our products. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate it into their products. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition, or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products. In addition, if we were to combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner under certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software products. If we inappropriately use or incorporate open source software subject to certain types of open source licenses that challenge the proprietary nature of our products, we may be required to re-engineer such products, discontinue the sale of such products, or take other remedial actions. \nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur debt service obligations, including the Notes, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, we had outstanding $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due December 1, 2025 (the 2025 Notes), $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due April 1, 2027 (the 2027 Notes, and together with the 2025 Notes, the Notes), and had drawn $135.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility, as described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our ability to make payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes and our Revolving Credit Facility, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Moreover, our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by our Divvy credit card receivables and certain other collateral.\n \nOur business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, \n47\nrestructuring debt, or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt.\nIn addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry, and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital, and for other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022\nmake an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult.\nAny of these factors could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase. We are also required to comply with the covenants set forth in the indentures governing the Notes. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities. Downgrades in our credit ratings could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary for cash settlement upon conversion of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes for cash upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indentures governing the 2025 Notes and 2027 Notes, respectively) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus\n \naccrued and unpaid special interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the Notes surrendered or the Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority, or by agreements governing our future indebtedness.\nIn addition to the Notes, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our current and future debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indentures governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt, or taking a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due. \nOur failure to repurchase the Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by such indenture would constitute a default under that indenture. A default under one of the indentures or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under the other indenture or other agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or \n48\ngrace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, when triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nPrior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2025, in the case of the 2025 Notes, and January 1, 2027, in the case of the 2027 Notes, the holders of the applicable Notes may elect to convert their Notes during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day (Conversion Condition). The Conversion Condition for the 2025 Notes and 2027 Notes was not triggered as of June\u00a030, 2023, but had been triggered for the 2025 Notes in several prior quarters. In the event the Conversion Condition is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe Capped Calls may affect the value of our Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the sale of each of the 2025 Notes and the 2027 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated Capped Call transactions (collectively, the Capped Calls) with certain financial institutions (option counterparties). The Capped Call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nThe option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the applicable maturity of the 2025 Notes and the 2027 Notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion, repurchase, or redemption of the Notes, to the extent we exercise the relevant election under the Capped Calls). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes, which could affect note holders\u2019 ability to convert the Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes, it could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration that note holders will receive upon conversion of the Notes.\nWe do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes or our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the option counterparties will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Capped Calls.\nThe option counterparties are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the Capped Calls. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the Capped Calls with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\n49\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe stock price of our common stock has been, and will likely continue to be volatile, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nThe market for our common stock has been, and will likely continue to be, volatile. In addition to the factors discussed in this report, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in the financial projections we may provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry, such as high inflation and high interest rate and recessionary environments;\n\u2022\nthe global macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity related to the real or perceived quality of our platform, as well as the failure to timely launch new products and services that gain market acceptance;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products or services, commercial relationships, or significant technical innovations;\n\u2022\nacquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us, litigation involving our industry, or both;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our or other parties\u2019 products, services, or intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022\ninterpretations of any of the above or other factors by trading algorithms, including those that employ natural language processing and related methods to evaluate our public disclosures;\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war (such as the war in Ukraine), incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events;\n\u2022\ninstability in the U.S. and global banking systems;\n\u2022\nthe expiration of contractual lock-up agreements; and\n\u2022\nsales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies, and technology companies in particular, have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it \n50\ncould subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, and affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and\n \nrestated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms, rights, and preferences determined by our board of directors that may be senior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders be affected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, or our chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed for cause only upon the vote of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of our outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of our outstanding shares of common stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our second amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, to the fullest extent permitted by law, will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our second amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. These exclusive forum provisions will not apply to claims that are vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or for which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction. For instance, these provisions would not preclude the filing of claims brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), or the rules and regulations thereunder in federal court.\n51\nMoreover, Section 203 of the DGCL may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, which we expect to further increase. Sarbanes-Oxley, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE, and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly compared to when we were a private company.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a public company.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors and securities analysts, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. These new obligations and constituents require significant attention from our management team and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nOur stock price and trading volume is heavily influenced by the way analysts and investors interpret our financial information and other disclosures. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, downgrade our common stock, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price to decline and could decrease the trading volume of our common stock.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market. The perception that these sales might occur may also cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We had a total of 106,550,211 shares of our common stock outstanding as of June\u00a030, 2023. All shares of our common stock are either freely tradable, generally without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act, or have been registered for resale under the Securities Act by us, subject to certain exceptions for shares held by our \u201caffiliates\u201d as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. \nIn addition, we have filed registration statements on Form S-8 to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or settlement of outstanding restricted stock units will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\n52\nIn addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, or otherwise. We also expect to grant additional equity awards to employees and directors under our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan and rights to purchase our common stock under our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Any such issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nThe timing and amount of any repurchases under our Share Repurchase Program are subject to a number of uncertainties.\nIn January 2023, our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to $300 million of our outstanding shares of common stock (the Share Repurchase Program). Under the Share Repurchase Program, repurchases can be made from time to time using a variety of methods, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans, in compliance with the rules of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements. The Share Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of shares, and the Share Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, enacted on August 16, 2022, among other things, imposes a 1% non-deductible, excise tax on net repurchases of shares by U.S. corporations whose stock is traded on an established securities market. The excise tax is imposed on repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022. The excise tax did not apply to repurchases of our shares made during fiscal 2023. If excise tax applies to any repurchases of our shares we make in future fiscal years, it may increase the cost to us of making repurchases and may cause us to reduce the number of shares repurchased pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program\n.",
    "item7": ">Item 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Our fiscal year end is June 30, and our fiscal quarters end on September 30, December 31, and March 31.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in financial automation software for small and midsize businesses (SMBs). As a champion of SMBs, we are automating the future of finance so businesses can thrive. Hundreds of thousands of businesses rely on BILL to more efficiently control their payables, receivables, and spend and expense management. Our network connects millions of members so they can pay or get paid faster. Headquartered in San Jose, California, we are a trusted partner of leading U.S. financial institutions, accounting firms, and accounting software providers.\nOur purpose-built, AI-enabled financial software platform creates seamless connections between our customers, their suppliers, and their clients. Businesses on our platform generate and process invoices, streamline approvals, make and receive payments, manage employee expenses, sync with their accounting system, foster collaboration, and manage their cash. We have built sophisticated integrations with popular accounting software solutions, banks, card issuers, and payment processors, enabling our customers to access these mission-critical services quickly and easily. \nWe efficiently reach SMBs through our proven direct and indirect go-to-market strategies. We acquire new businesses to use our solutions directly through digital marketing and inside sales, and indirectly through accounting firms and financial institution partnerships. As of June\u00a030, 2023, our partners included some of the most trusted brands in the financial services business, including more than 85 of the top 100 accounting firms and seven of the top ten largest financial institutions for SMBs in the United States (U.S.), including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo Bank, and American Express. As we add customers and partners, we expect our network to continue to grow organically.\nWe have grown rapidly and scaled our business operations in recent periods. Our revenue was $1.1 billion and $642.0 million during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $416.5 million. We generated net losses of $223.7 million and $326.4 million during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nMacroeconomic and Other Factors \nOngoing interest rate increases and persistent inflation in the U.S. and other markets globally have increased the risk of an economic recession and volatility and dislocation in the capital and credit markets in the U.S. and globally. The SMBs we serve may be particularly susceptible to changes in overall economic and financial conditions, and certain SMBs may cease operations in the event of a recession or inability to access financing. The macroeconomic environment has caused our BILL standalone customers and Divvy spending businesses to moderate their expenditures, which has resulted in lower payment volume growth through our solutions than historical trends, which in turn has led to lower transaction fee growth than historical trends. Moreover, net customer adds on our BILL standalone solution were slightly lower than recent trends, caused in part by businesses taking longer to make decisions about whether or not to implement new software solutions in light of the current macro environment. In addition, increased interest rates have led to an increase in interest on funds held for customers. We have not observed any other material impacts on our business or the demand for our products as a result of these factors, but we anticipate volatile conditions and there can be no assurance that, in the event of a recession, demand for our products would not be adversely affected. We intend to continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions closely and may determine to take certain financial or operational actions in response to such conditions to the extent our business begins to be adversely impacted.\n57\nIn March 2023, instability in the U.S. banking system resulted in the closure of several U.S. banks, including Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), where we held significant company and customer funds. However, all of our and our customers' funds were preserved, and were able to re-route pending transactions involving SVB through other banking partners. Going forward, we will continue to assess the potential advantages in diversifying our banking relationships, including with both multinational financial institutions and, as appropriate, U.S. national and regional banks. Nonetheless, continued actual or perceived instability in the U.S. banking system that adversely effects any of the financial institutions with which we do business may adversely impact our ability to access our corporate cash and cash equivalents and cash held in trust on behalf of customers or process customer payments.\nIn addition, for so long as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including variants thereof, persist, restrictions and policies implemented by governments and companies may continue to impact our business and the businesses of the SMBs we serve. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted several programs and precautionary measures in support of employee well-being and to protect the health and safety of our workforce, our customers, and the communities in which we participate. Such measures included closure of our corporate headquarters in California and our office in Texas, implementing full-time work from home, and eliminating non-essential travel. We continue to monitor federal, state, and local regulatory pronouncements and COVID-19 infection statistics and have reopened our offices with our return to office plan, which encompasses a hybrid approach to in-office attendance based on the different needs of teams across the company.\nAny of these conditions or actions may have a negative impact on our future results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. \nW\ne are unable to predict the full impact that macroeconomic factors, banking sector dynamics or the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our future results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration of the pandemic, the actions that may be taken by government authorities across the U.S. or other countries, changes in central bank policies and interest rates, rates of inflation, the impact to our customers, spending businesses, subscribers, partners, and suppliers, and other factors described in the section titled \u201c\nRisk Factors\n\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Revenue Model\nWe generate revenue primarily from subscription and transaction fees. \nOur subscription revenue is primarily based on a fixed monthly or annual rate per user charged to our customers. Our transaction revenue consists of transaction fees and interchange income on a fixed or variable rate per transaction. Transactions primarily include card payments, real-time payments, check payments, ACH payments, cross-border payments, and creation of invoices. Much of our revenue comes from repeat transactions, which are an important contributor to our recurring revenue.\nIn addition, we generate revenue from interest on funds held for customers. When we process payment transactions, the funds flow through our bank accounts, resulting in a balance of funds held for customers. This balance is determined by volume and the type of payments processed. Interest is earned from interest-bearing deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, money market funds, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, municipal bonds, commercial paper, U.S. treasury securities and U.S. agency securities. We hold these funds from the day they are withdrawn from a payer\u2019s account to the day the funds are credited to the receiver. This revenue can fluctuate depending on the amount of customer funds held, as well as our yield on customer funds invested, which is influenced by market interest rates and our investments.\nOur Receivables Purchases and Servicing Model\nWe market Divvy charge cards to potential spending businesses and issue business-purpose charge cards through our card issuing partner banks (Issuing Banks). When a business applies for a Divvy card, we utilize, on behalf of the Issuing Bank, proprietary risk management capabilities to confirm the identity of the business, and perform a credit underwriting process to determine if the business is eligible for a Divvy card pursuant to our credit policies. Once approved for a Divvy card, the spending business is provided a credit limit and can use the Divvy software to request virtual cards or physical cards.\n58\nThe majority of cards on our platform are issued by Cross River Bank, a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured New Jersey state chartered bank, and WEX Bank, an FDIC-insured Utah state chartered bank. Under our arrangements with our Issuing Banks, we must comply with their respective credit policies and underwriting procedures, and the Issuing Banks maintain ultimate authority to decide whether to issue a card or approve a transaction. We are responsible for all fraud and unauthorized use of a card and generally are required to hold the Issuing Bank harmless from such losses unless claims regarding fraud or unauthorized use are due to the sole gross negligence of the Issuing Bank. \nWhen a spending business completes a purchase transaction, the payment to the supplier is made by the cards' Issuing Bank. Obligations incurred by the spending business in connection with their purchase transaction are reflected as receivables on the Issuing Bank\u2019s balance sheet from the Divvy card account for the spending business. The Issuing Bank then sells a 100% participation interest in the receivable to us. Pursuant to our agreements with the Issuing Banks, we are obligated to purchase the participation interests in all of the receivables originated through our platform, and our obligations are secured by cash deposits. When we purchase the participation interests, the purchase price is equal to the outstanding principal balance of the receivable.\nIn order to purchase the participation rights in the receivables, we maintain a variety of funding arrangements, including warehouse facilities and, from time-to-time, other purchase arrangements with a diverse set of funding sources. We typically fund some portion of these participation interest purchases by borrowing under our credit facilities, although we may also fund purchases using corporate cash.\nOur Business Model\nWe efficiently reach SMBs through our proven direct and indirect go-to-market strategies. We acquire them directly through digital marketing and inside sales and indirectly by partnering with leading companies that are trusted by SMBs, including accounting firms, financial institutions, and software companies.\nOur revenue from existing businesses using our solutions is visible and predicta\nble. For fiscal 2023, over 87% of ou\nr subscription and transaction revenue from \nBILL standalone customers\n came from customers who were acquired prior to the start of the fiscal year. See \"\u2014\nKey Business Metrics\u2014Businesses Using Our Solutions\n\" below for the definition of BILL standalone \ncustomers\n. We expand within our existing customer base by adding more users, increasing transactions per customer, launching additional products, and through pricing and packaging our services. We make it easy for SMBs to try our platform through our risk-free trial program. Should an SMB choose to become a customer after the trial period, it can take several months to adapt their financial operations to fully leverage our platform. Even with a transition period\n, however, we believe our customer retention is strong. Excluding those customers of our financial institution partners, approximately 86% of BILL standalone customers as of June\u00a030, 2022 were still customers as of June\u00a030, 2023.\nNet Dollar-Based Retention Rate\nNet dollar-based retention rate is an important indicator of customer satisfaction and usage of our platform, as well as potential revenue for future periods. We calculate our net dollar-based retention rate at the end of each fiscal year. We calculate our net dollar-based retention rate by starting with the revenue billed to \nBILL standalone customers in\n the last quarter of the prior fiscal year (Prior Period Revenue). We then calculate the revenue billed to these same customers in the last quarter of the current fiscal year (Current Period Revenue). See \"\u2014\nKey Business Metrics\u2014Businesses Using Our Solutions\n\" below for the definition of BILL standalone customer. Current Period Revenue includes any upsells and is net of contraction or attrition, but excludes revenue from new customers and excludes interest earned on funds held on behalf of customers. We then repeat the calculation of Prior Period Revenue and Current Period Revenue with respect to each of the preceding three quarters, and aggregate the four Prior Period Revenues (the Aggregate Prior Period Revenue) and the four Current Period Revenues (the Aggregate Current Period Revenue). Our net dollar-based retention rate equals the Aggregate Current Period Revenue divided by Aggregate Prior Period Revenue.\nOur net doll\nar-based retention rate was 111%, 131%, and 124% during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2023 when compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to the change in spending patterns per customer, driven by the challenging macroeconomic environment. The increase in fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to increase in the number of users, more transactions per customer, and sales of additional products to those customers. \n59\nCustomer Acquisition Efficiency\nOur efficient direct and indirect go-to-market strategy, combined with our recurring revenue model, results in our short payback period. We define \u201cpayback period\u201d as the number of quarters it takes for the cumulative non-GAAP (as defined below) gross profit we earn from BILL standalone customers acquired during a given quarter to exceed our total sales and marketing spend in that same quarter, excluding customers acquired through financial institutions and the related sales and marketing spend. See \"\u2014\nKey Business Metrics\u2014Businesses Using Our Solutions\n\" below for the definition of BILL standalone customer\n. For BILL standalone customers acquired during fiscal 2022, the average payback period was approximately five quarters.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe regularly review several metrics, including the key business metrics presented in the table below (as well as the additional metrics described in\n \"Our Business Model\n\"), to measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We periodically review and revise these metrics to reflect changes in our business.\n \nWe present our key business metrics on a consolidated basis, which we believe better reflects the performance of our consolidated business overall. Our key business metrics are defined following the table below and track our BILL standalone, Divvy, and Invoice2go solutions combined. The relevant metrics for each of BILL standalone, Divvy, and Invoice2go, respectively, are set forth in the footnotes to the table. The calculation of the key business metrics and other measures discussed below may differ from other similarly-titled metrics used by other companies, securities analysts, or investors.\nAs of June 30,\n% Growth\nas of June 30,\n2023\n2022\n (4)\n2021\n (5)\n2023\n2022\nBusinesses using our solutions \n(1)\n461,000\u00a0\n400,100\u00a0\n131,900\u00a0\n15\u00a0\n%\n203\u00a0\n%\nYear ended\nJune 30,\n% Growth\nYear ended June 30,\n2023\n2022\n (4)\n2021\n (5)\n2023\n2022\nTotal Payment Volume (amounts in billions) \n(2)\n$\n266.0\u00a0\n$\n228.1\u00a0\n$\n140.7\u00a0\n17\u00a0\n%\n62\u00a0\n%\nYear ended\nJune 30,\n% Growth\nYear ended June 30,\n2023\n2022\n (4)\n2021\n (5)\n2023\n2022\nTransactions processed (in millions) \n(3)\n85.1\u00a0\n62.9\u00a0\n30.6\u00a0\n35\u00a0\n%\n105\u00a0\n%\n(1)\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023, the total number of BILL standalone customers was approximately 201,000; the total number of spending businesses that used Divvy's spend and expense management products was approximately 29,200, and the total number of Invoice2go subscribers was approximately 230,800.\n(2)\nDuring fiscal 2023, the total payment volume transacted by BILL standalone customers was approximately $251.5 billion; the total card payment volume transacted by spending businesses that used Divvy cards was approximately $13.4 billion; and the total payment volume transacted by Invoice2go subscribers was approximately $1.1 billion.\n(3)\nDuring fiscal 2023, the total number of transactions executed by BILL standalone customers was approximately 44.3 million; the total number of transactions executed by spending businesses that used Divvy cards was approximately 39.5 million; and the total number of transactions executed by Invoice2go subscribers was approximately 1.3 million.\n(4)\nIncludes Invoice2go metrics from the acquisition date on September 1, 2021.\n(5)\nIncludes Divvy metrics from the acquisition date on June 1, 2021.\n60\nBusinesses Using Our Solutions\nFor the purposes of measuring our key business metrics, we define businesses using our solutions as the summation of: (A) customers that are either billed directly by us or for which we bill our partners for our BILL standalone products during a particular period, (B) spending businesses that use Divvy's spend and expense management products during the period, and (C) Invoice2go subscribers during the period. We define BILL standalone products as those offered on our core accounts payable and receivable platform (excluding Divvy and Invoice2go), and we define BILL standalone customers as customers using our core BILL accounts payable and accounts receivable offering.  In prior fiscal years, we counted and reported only BILL standalone customers in our \"Number of Customers\", which excluded spending businesses using our Divvy solution and our Invoice2go subscribers. In light of the growth of our company in recent periods, we consider the businesses using our solutions metric to better represent the performance and scale of our business as it currently exists. Businesses using more than one of our solutions are included separately in the total for each solution utilized; as of June 30, 2023, this included approximately 7,200 businesses. Businesses using our solutions during a trial period are not counted as new businesses using our solutions during that period. If an organization has multiple entities billed separately for the use of our solutions, each entity is counted as a business using our solutions. The number of businesses using our solutions in the table above represents the total number of businesses using our solutions at the end of each fiscal year. \nTotal Payment Volume\nTo grow revenue from businesses using our solutions, we must deliver a product experience that helps them automate their back-office financial operations. The more they use and rely upon our  product offerings to automate their operations, the more transactions they process on our platform. This metric provides an important indication of the aggregate value of transactions that businesses using our solutions are completing on our platform and is an indicator of our ability to generate revenue from businesses using our solutions. We define TPV as the total value of transactions that we process on our platform during a particular period, including transactions from BILL standalone customers, Divvy card transactions, and transactions executed by Invoice2go subscribers. Our calculation of TPV includes payments that are subsequently reversed. Such payments comprised less than 2% of TPV during each of fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021. \nTransactions Processed\nWe define transactions processed as the total number of payments initiated and processed through our platform during a particular period. Payment transactions include checks, ACH payments, card payments, Invoice2go subscriber transactions, real-time payments, and cross-border payments\n.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from subscription and transaction fees. \nSubscription fees are fixed monthly or annually and charged to customers for the use of our platform to process transactions. Subscription fees are generally charged either on a per user or per customer account per period basis, normally monthly or annually. Transaction fees are fees collected for each transaction processed, on either a fixed or variable fee basis. Transaction fees primarily include processing of payments in the form of checks, ACH, card payments, real-time payments, and cross-border payments, and the creation of invoices. Transaction fees also include interchange fees paid by suppliers accepting card payments.\nOur contracts with SMB and accounting firm customers provide them with access to the functionality of our cloud-based payments platform to process transactions. These contracts are either monthly contracts paid in arrears or upfront, or annual arrangements paid up front. We charge our SMB and accounting firm customers subscription fees to access our platform either based on the number of users or per customer account and the level of service. We generally also charge these customers transaction fees based on transaction volume and the category of transaction. The contractual price for subscription and transaction services is based on either negotiated fees or the rates published on our website. Revenue recognized excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes collected and remitted to governmental authorities.\n61\nWe enable our SMB and accounting firm customers to make virtual card payments to their suppliers. We also facilitate the extension of credit to spending businesses in the form of Divvy cards. The spending businesses utilize the credit on Divvy cards as a means of payment for goods and services provided by their suppliers. Virtual card payments and Divvy cards are originated through agreements with our Issuing Banks. Our agreements with the Issuing Banks allow for card transactions on the Mastercard and Visa networks. For each virtual card and Divvy card transaction, suppliers are required to pay interchange fees to the issuer of the card. Based on our agreements with the Issuing Banks, we recognize the interchange fees as revenue gross or net of rebates received from the Issuing Banks based on our determination of whether we are the principal or the agent under the agreements.\nWe also enter into multi-year contracts with financial institution customers to provide them with access to our cloud-based payments platform. These contracts typically include fees for initial implementation services that are paid during the period the implementation services are provided as well as fees for subscription and transaction processing services, which are subject to guaranteed monthly minimum fees that are paid monthly over the contract term. These contracts enable the financial institutions to provide their customers with access to online bill pay services through the financial institutions\u2019 online platforms. Implementation services are required up-front to establish an infrastructure that allows the financial institutions\u2019 online platforms to communicate with our online platform. A financial institution\u2019s customers cannot access online bill pay services until implementation is complete. The total consideration in these contracts varies based on the number of users and transactions to be processed.\nIn addition, we generate revenue from interest on funds held for customers. Interest on funds held for customers consists of the interest that we earn from customer funds while payment transactions are clearing. Interest is earned from interest-bearing deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, municipal bonds, money market funds, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury securities, until those payments are cleared and credited to the intended recipient.\nService Costs and Expenses\nService costs \n\u2013\n Service costs consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expenses, for our customer success and payment operations teams, outsourced support services for our customer success team, costs that are directly attributed to processing customers\u2019 and spending businesses' transactions (such as the cost of printing checks, postage for mailing checks, fees associated with the issuance and processing of card transactions, fees for processing payments, such as ACH, checks, and cross-border wires), direct and amortized costs for implementing and integrating our cloud-based platform into our customers\u2019 systems, costs for maintaining, optimizing, and securing our cloud payments infrastructure, amortization of capitalized internal-use developed software related to our platform, fees on the investment of customer funds, and allocation of overhead costs. We expect that service costs will increase in absolute dollars, but may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period, as we continue to invest in growing our business.\nResearch and development\n \n(R&D)\n \n\u2013\n R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, for our R&D teams, incurred in developing new products or enhancing existing products, and allocated overhead costs. We expense a substantial portion of R&D expenses as incurred. We believe that delivering new and enhanced functionality is critical to attract new customers and expand our relationship with existing customers. We expect to continue to make investments in and expand our offerings to enhance our customers\u2019 experience and satisfaction, and to attract new customers. We expect our R&D expenses to increase in absolute dollars, but they may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period as we expand our R&D team to develop new products and product enhancements. We capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing new products and adding incremental functionality to our platform and amortize such costs into service costs over the estimated life of the new product or incremental functionality, which is generally three years.\nSales and marketing\n \n\u2013\n Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, for our sales and marketing teams, rewards expense in connection with our card rewards programs, sales commissions, marketing program expenses, travel-related expenses, and costs to market and promote our platform through advertisements, marketing events, partnership \n62\narrangements, direct customer acquisition, and allocated overhead costs. Sales commissions that are incremental to obtaining new customer contracts are deferred and amortized ratably over the estimated period of our relationship with new customers.\nWe focus our sales and marketing efforts on generating awareness of our company, platform, and products, creating sales leads, and establishing and promoting our brand. We plan to continue investing in sales and marketing efforts by driving our go-to-market strategies, building our brand awareness, and sponsoring additional marketing events; however, we will adjust our sales and marketing spend level as needed, as the spend may fluctuate from period to period, in response to changes in the economic environment.\nGeneral and administrative\n \n\u2013\n General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, for finance, corporate business operations, risk management, legal and compliance, human resources, information technology, costs incurred for external professional services, provision for credit losses, losses from fraud, and allocated overhead costs. We expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses as we explore various growth initiatives, which include incurring higher costs for professional services. We also expect to increase the size of our general and administrative functions to support the growth in our business. As a result, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars but may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period.\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets\n \n\u2013\n Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets consist of depreciation of property and equipment, and amortization of acquired intangibles, such as developed technology, customer relationship, and trade names.

A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 can be found under Item 7 of Part II in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June\u00a030, 2022, filed with the SEC on August 22, 2022, which is available free of charge on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov and on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at investor.bill.com.\nRevenue\nRevenue consisted mainly of subscription and transactions fees. Subscription revenue increased by $59.8 million, or 31%, during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the increase in customers and average subscription revenue per customer due to an increase in the number of users. Transaction fee \n65\nrevenue increased by $251.5 million, or 57%, during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to increased total payment volume and the mix of transaction revenue shifting to variable-priced products. In addition, interest on funds held for customers increased by $105.2 million, or 1224%, during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to an increase in yield earned from investing customer funds as interest rates increased during fiscal 2023.\nOur revenue could be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future, especially if our revenue through our international operations and international payments grows as a percentage of our revenue or our international operations increase.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin\nCost of revenue, gross profit, and gross margin were as follows (amounts in thousands): \nYear ended June 30,\nChange\n2023\n2022 \n(1)\nAmount\n%\nCost of revenue:\nService costs\n$\n151,010\u00a0\n$\n105,496\u00a0\n$\n45,514\u00a0\n43\u00a0\n%\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets \n(2)\n42,967\u00a0\n39,508\u00a0\n3,459\u00a0\n9\u00a0\n%\nTotal cost of revenue\n$\n193,977\u00a0\n$\n145,004\u00a0\n$\n48,973\u00a0\n34\u00a0\n%\nGross profit\n$\n864,491\u00a0\n$\n496,955\u00a0\n$\n367,536\u00a0\n74\u00a0\n%\nGross margin\n82\u00a0\n%\n77\u00a0\n%\n(1) \nIncludes the results of Invoice2go from the acquisition date on September 1, 2021.\n(2) \nConsists of depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of developed technology, excluding amortization of capitalized internal-use software wages costs.\nService costs increased by $45.5 million during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to:\n\u2022\na $22.4 million increase in direct costs associated with the processing of our customers\u2019 payment transactions, use of software applications and equipment, bank fees for funds held for customers, and data hosting services, which were driven by the increase in the number of customers, increased adoption of new product offerings, and an increase in the volume of transactions;\n\u2022\na $16.2 million increase in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense and increased deferred service costs amortization, due to the hiring of additional personnel, who were directly engaged in providing implementation and support services to our customers; and\n\u2022\na $6.9 million increase in costs for consultants, temporary contractors, shared overhead, and other costs.\nGross margin increased to 82% during fiscal 2023 from 77% during fiscal 2022, primarily due to the increase in interest on funds held for customers and a higher mix of variable-priced transaction revenue.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $94.8 million during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the following: \n\u2022\na $95.4 million increase in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, resulting from the hiring of additional personnel and added headcount from our acquisition of Invoice2Go, who were directly engaged in developing new product offerings; \n\u2022\na $5.8 million increase in computer-related expenses and software costs and increase in shared overhead and other costs; and partially offset by\n66\n\u2022\na $6.4 million decrease in costs for engaging consultants and temporary contractors who provided product development services, which have now been replaced by full-time employees.\nOur research and development expenses decreased to 30% as a percentage of revenue during fiscal 2023 from 34% during fiscal 2022, primarily due to a higher revenue growth rate but a relatively lower increase in personnel-related expenses as a percentage of revenue and decrease in consulting costs during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. \nWe expect research and development expenses to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future, especially if our international operations increase.\nSales and Marketing Expenses \nSales and marketing expenses increased by $208.7 million during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022\na $106.3 million increase in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense of $52.2 million recognized during the year related to the separation and advisory agreements with our former Chief Revenue Officer, and due to the hiring of additional personnel, who were directly engaged in acquiring new customers and in marketing our products and services;\n\u2022\na $78.7 million increase in rewards expense in connection with the rewards program through our Divvy cards as a result of increased transaction volume and higher rewards rates;\n\u2022\na $21.1 million increase in advertising spend and various marketing initiatives and activities, such as engaging consultants and attending marketing events, as we increased our efforts in promoting our products and services and in increasing brand awareness; and\n\u2022\na $2.6 million increase in software subscription and computer-related expenses, shared overhead, and other costs. \nOur sales and marketing expenses increased to 49% as a percentage of revenue during fiscal 2023 from 48% during fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher rewards expense and stock-based compensation expense recognized during fiscal 2023.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $40.1 million during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022\na $30.7 million increase in personnel-related expense, including stock-based compensation expense, resulting from the hiring of additional general and administrative personnel;\n\u2022\na $15.2 million increase in provision for expected credit losses and fraud losses mainly due to increase in acquired card receivables during the year; \n\u2022\na $3.7 million increase in software subscription and computer-related expenses, temporary contractors, shared overhead and other costs; and partially offset by\n\u2022\na $9.6 million decrease in professional and consulting fees, primarily resulting from the reduction of integration costs of acquired businesses.\nOur general and administrative expenses decreased to 26% as a percentage of revenue during fiscal 2023 from 38% during fiscal 2022, primarily due to a higher revenue growth rate but a relatively lower increase in personnel-related expense and provision for expected credit losses and fraud losses as a percentage of revenue.\n67\nDepreciation and Amortization of Intangible Assets\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased by $6.3 million during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to a full-year amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of Invoice2go in September 2021, as well as higher spend on capital expenditures.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net increased by $86.7 million during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022\na $84.6 million increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on corporate funds;\n\u2022\na $9.9 million decrease in discount associated with the measurement of cards receivable sold and held for sale at a lower of cost or market as we ceased selling acquired card receivables in August 2022; and partially offset by \n\u2022\na $7.8 million increase in other expenses mainly due to interest expense primarily as the result of higher interest rates and increased borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes during fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, consists of the reduction to the net deferred tax liability, offset by an estimated cash tax liability as a result of the mandatory R&D capitalization by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was effective beginning fiscal 2023. R&D expenses are capitalized and amortized over five years for domestic R&D and fifteen years for international R&D. The requirement increases our current year cash tax liabilities, however, the cash flow impact is expected to decrease over time as capitalized research and development expenses continue to amortize.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly-titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors\u2019 overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP metrics to assist investors in seeing our financial performance using a management view. We believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin\nWe define non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit minus depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, and stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes recognized in cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as non-GAAP gross profit, divided by revenue. We believe non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of our non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin to our gross profit and gross margin for the periods presented (amounts in thousands)\n:\n68\nYear ended June 30,\n2023\n2022 \n(1)\n2021 \n(2)\nRevenue\n$\n1,058,468\n$\n641,959\n$\n238,265\nGross profit\n$\n864,491\n$\n496,955\n$\n176,459\nAdd:\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets\n (3)\n42,967\n39,508\n5,230\nStock-based compensation charged to expenses and related payroll taxes\n9,428\n5,599\n3,309\nNon-GAAP gross profit\n$\n916,886\n$\n542,062\n$\n184,998\nGross margin\n81.7\u00a0\n%\n77.4\u00a0\n%\n74.1\u00a0\n%\nNon-GAAP gross margin\n86.6\u00a0\n%\n84.4\u00a0\n%\n77.6\u00a0\n%\n(1) \nIncludes the results of Invoice2go from the acquisition date on September 1, 2021.\n(2) \nIncludes the results of Divvy from the acquisition date on June 1, 2021.\n(3) \nConsists of depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of developed technology, excluding amortization of capitalized internal-use software cost.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, adjusted by purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software costs. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash (if any) that is available, after purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software costs, for operational expenses and investment in our business. Free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in future growth. The following table presents a reconciliation of our free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the periods presented (in thousands)\n:\nYear ended June 30,\n2023\n2022 \n(1)\n2021 \n(2)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n$\n187,768\u00a0\n$\n(18,093)\n$\n4,623\u00a0\nPurchases of property and equipment\n(7,589)\n(5,377)\n(18,902)\nCapitalization of internal-use software costs\n(23,614)\n(10,259)\n(2,304)\nFree cash flow\n$\n156,565\u00a0\n$\n(33,729)\n$\n(16,583)\n(1) \nIncludes the results of Invoice2go from the acquisition date on September 1, 2021.\n(2) \nIncludes the results of Divvy from the acquisition date on June 1, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June\u00a030, 2023\n, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 billion, our available-for-sale short-term investments of $1.0 billion, and our available undrawn Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) of $90.0\u00a0million. Our cash equivalents are comprised primarily of money market funds and investments in debt securities with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Our short-term investments are comprised primarily of available-for-sale investments in corporate bonds, certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities, municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities, and U.S. treasury securities with original maturities of more than three months. Our corporate deposits held at large multinational financial institutions and U.S. national or regional banks, may at times exceed federally insured limits. We monitor the financial strength of the financial institutions with which we do business to ensure they are financially sound and present minimal credit risk. We further believe the associated risk of concentration for our investments is mitigated by holding a diversified portfolio of highly rated investments consisting of the money market funds and short-term debt securities described above. We have a total borrowing commitment of $225.0 million from our Revolving Credit Facility and have drawn $135.0 million as of June\u00a030, 2023. Our principal uses \n69\nof cash are funding our operations and other working capital requirements, including the contractual and other obligations \ndiscussed below.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements to fund future operations or obligations, including the repayment of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Notes become convertible and the note holders opt to exercise their right to convert. We may also seek to raise additional capital from these offerings or financings on an opportunistic basis when we believe there are suitable opportunities for doing so. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by incurring additional indebtedness, we may be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any future indebtedness we incur may have terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital. The inability to raise capital would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives.\nOur principal commitments to settle our contractual obligations consist of our 2027 Notes, 2025 Notes, and outstanding borrowings from our \nRevolving Credit Facility\n as further discussed below. \nFor additional discussion about our Notes and Revolving Credit Facility, refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we have minimum commitments under our noncancellable operating lease agreements and agreements with certain vendors. For additional discussion about our commitments, including operating leases, refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn January 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock (the Share Repurchase Program). We may repurchase shares of common stock from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, or by other means, including through the use of trading plans, intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing and total amount of share repurchases will depend upon business, economic and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, prevailing stock prices, and other considerations. The Share Repurchase Program has a term of 12 months, may be suspended or discontinued at any time, and does not obligate us to acquire any amount of common stock. During the year ended June\u00a030, 2023, we repurchased and subsequently retired 1,077,445 shares for $87.6 million under the Share Repurchase Program. The total price of the shares repurchased and related transaction costs are reflected as a reduction of common stock and accumulated deficit on the our consolidated balance sheets. As of June\u00a030, 2023, $212.4 million remained available for future share repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program.\nCash Flows\nBelow is a summary of our consolidated cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\u00a0\nYear ended June 30,\n\u00a0\n2023\n2022\n (1)\n2021\n (2)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n187,768\u00a0\n$\n(18,093)\n$\n4,623\u00a0\nInvesting activities\n$\n259,285\u00a0\n$\n(1,127,302)\n$\n(1,426,890)\nFinancing activities\n$\n235,110\u00a0\n$\n2,878,566\u00a0\n$\n1,639,583\u00a0\n70\n(1) \nIncludes the results of Invoice2go from the acquisition date on September 1, 2021.\n(2) \nIncludes the results of Divvy from the acquisition date on June 1, 2021.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities\nOur primary source of cash provided by our operating activities is our revenue from subscription and transaction fees. Our subscription revenue is primarily based on a fixed monthly or annual rate per user charged to our customers. Our transaction revenue is comprised of transaction fees on a fixed or variable rate per type of transaction. We also generate cash from the interest earned on both corporate funds and funds held in trust on behalf of customers. Our primary uses of cash in our operating activities include payments for employees' salaries and related costs, payments to third parties to fulfill our payment transactions, payments to sales and marketing partners, payments for card rewards expenses, and other general corporate expenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $187.8 million during fiscal 2023 compared to a net cash used of $18.1 million during fiscal 2022. The net cash provided during fiscal 2023 was due mainly to the increase in our revenue during the year.\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased to $18.1 million during fiscal 2022 from a net cash provided of $4.6 million during fiscal 2021. The net cash used during fiscal 2022 was due mainly to the timing of the payments for costs of our services and operating expenses, partially offset by the increase in our revenue. \nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nOur cash usage for our investing activities consists primarily of purchases of corporate and customer fund available for-sale investments, purchases of card receivables, business acquisitions, capitalization of internal-use software, and purchases of property and equipment. Our cash proceeds from our investing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the maturities and sale of corporate and customer fund available-for-sale investments. Additionally, the increase or decrease in our net cash from investing activities is impacted by the net change in acquired card receivable balances.\nOur net cash provided by investing activities was $259.3 million during fiscal 2023 compared to net cash used of $1.1 billion during fiscal 2022 due primarily to the increase in proceeds from maturities of corporate and customer short-term investments, partially offset by the increase in acquired card receivables. Additionally, our cash paid for acquisitions during fiscal 2023 was lower compared to our payment to acquire Invoice2go during fiscal 2022.\nOur net cash used in investing activities decreased to $1.1 billion during fiscal 2022 from $1.4 billion during fiscal 2021 due primarily to the increase in proceeds from maturities of corporate and customer short-term investments, partially offset by the increase in purchases of corporate and customer fund short-term investments, and increase in acquired participation interests in card receivables. Additionally, our payment to acquire Invoice2go during fiscal 2022 was lower compared to our payment to acquire Divvy during fiscal 2021.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nOur cash proceeds from our financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from line of credit borrowings, exercises of stock options, increase in prepaid card deposits, employee purchases of our common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) and proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and issuance of convertible notes. Our cash usage for our financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of shares, and payments on line of credit and bank borrowings. Additionally, the increase or decrease in our net cash from financing activities is impacted by the change in customer fund deposits liability.\nOur net cash provided by financing activities decreased to $235.1 million during fiscal 2023 from $2.9 billion during fiscal 2022 due primarily to the absence of the proceeds from the public offering of our common stock and the issuance of our 2027 Notes in the prior year, as well as a decrease in customer funds liability, partially offset by proceeds from our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur net cash provided by financing activities increased to $2.9 billion during fiscal 2022 from $1.6 billion during fiscal 2021 due primarily to the proceeds from the public offering of our common stock and increase in customer funds liability.\n \n71\n2027 Notes\nOn September 24, 2021, we issued $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 0% convertible senior notes due on April 1, 2027. The 2027 Notes are senior, unsecured obligations, will not accrue interest unless we determine to pay special interest, and are convertible on or after January 1, 2027 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date on April 1, 2027. The 2027 Notes are convertible by the holders at their option during any calendar quarter after December 31, 2021 under certain circumstances, including if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on and including the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the $414.80 per share initial conversion price. If the note holders exercise their right to convert, our current intent is to settle such conversion through a combination settlement involving a repayment of the principal portion in cash and the balance in shares of common stock. For additional discussion about our 2027 Notes and the capped call transactions, refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2025 Notes\nOn November 30, 2020, we issued $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 0% convertible senior notes due on December 1, 2025. The 2025 Notes are senior, unsecured obligations, will not accrue interest unless we determine to pay special interest, and are convertible on or after September 1, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date on December 1, 2025. The 2025 Notes are convertible by the holders at their option during any calendar quarter after March 31, 2021 under certain circumstances, including if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on and including the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the $160.88 per share initial conversion price. If the note holders exercise their right to convert, our current intent is to settle such conversion through a combination settlement involving a repayment of the principal portion in cash and the balance in shares of common stock. For additional discussion about our 2025 Notes and the capped call transactions, refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe have a total borrowing commitment of $225.0 million pursuant to our Revolving Credit and Security Agreement, by and between our subsidiary, Divvy Peach, LLC, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, and the lenders party thereto (the Revolving Credit Facility), of which we borrowed $135.0 million as of June\u00a030, 2023. In August 2022, we amended the Revolving Credit Facility to increase the borrowing capacity from $75.0 million to $225.0 million. Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum determined by reference to either the SOFR Rate or an adjusted benchmark rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.65% to 2.75%, based on the outstanding principal amount and the date that principal amounts are outstanding. Obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by receivables generated by our Divvy charge card and certain related collateral. Our Revolving Credit Facility matures in June 2024 and the outstanding borrowings are payable on or before the maturity date. For additional discussion about our Revolving Credit Facility, refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are contractually obligated to purchase all card receivables from U.S.-based Issuing Banks including authorized transactions that have not cleared. The transactions that have been authorized but not cleared totaled $68.6 million as of June\u00a030, 2023 and have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. We have off-balance sheet credit exposures with these authorized but not cleared transactions; however, our expected credit losses with respect to these transactions were not material as of June\u00a030, 2023. \nOther than our expected credit loss exposure on the card transactions that have not cleared, we had no other off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources as of June\u00a030, 2023.\n72\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated, and reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following critical accounting estimates are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nRevenue Recognition \nOur contracts with our customers require us to provide multiple services comprising subscription, transaction and implementation services. We identify performance obligations in these contracts by evaluating whether individual services are distinct. Services that are not distinct are combined into a single performance obligation. The evaluation of whether a service is distinct involves judgment and could impact the timing of revenue recognition. We determine the transaction price in these contracts based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to, which are typically variable. The transaction price is then allocated to each separate performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Each performance obligation is analyzed to determine if it is satisfied over time or at a point in time. Our performance obligations are generally recognized as revenue over the period each performance obligation is satisfied using an attribution method that best reflects the measure of progress in satisfying the performance obligation. The attribution method used involves judgment and impacts the timing of revenue recognition.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires assigning the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the acquiree at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquiree, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.\nCredit Losses on Acquired Card Receivables\nWe acquire card receivables pursuant to our contracts with certain Issuing Banks. The acquired card receivable portfolio consists of a large group of smaller balances from spending businesses across a wide range of industries. We establish an allowance for credit losses based on an estimate of uncollectible balances resulting from credit losses and such allowance could fluctuate depending on certain factors. An estimate of lifetime expected credit losses is performed by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reas\nonable and supportable period beyond the balance sheet date. In estimating expected credit losses, we use models that entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves relate to the attributes used to segment the portfolio, the determination of the historical loss experience look-back period, and the weighting of historical loss experience by monthly cohort. We use these models and assumptions to determine the reserve rates applicable to the outstanding acquired card receivable balances to estimate reserves for expected credit losses. Based on historical loss experience, the probability of default decreases over time, therefore the attribute used to segment the portfolio is the length of time since an account\u2019s credit limit origination. Our \n73\nmodels use past loss experience to estimate the probability of default and exposure at default by aged balances. We also estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off ca\nrd receivables based on historical recovery experience. Additionally, we evaluate whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, changes in underwriting strategies, the nature and volume of the portfolio, and the volume and severity of past due accounts.\nWe review our assumptions periodically and the amount of allowance that we recorded may be impacted by actual performance of the acquired card receivables and changes in any of the assumptions used. In general, we write-off card receivables after the balance substantially becomes 120 days delinquent. \nSpending Businesses Rewards\nWe offer a promotion program whereby users of our spend and expense management products can earn rewards based on the volume of their card transactions. Users can redeem those rewards for statement credits or cash, travel, and gift cards, among other things. We establish a rewards liability that represents management\u2019s estimate of the cost for earned rewards. The portion of our liability related to points earned is determined based on an estimate of the redemption cost and an estimate of expected redemption (net of breakage). Our estimated liability could fluctuate based on the changes on the input used to make our estimate.\nStock-based Compensation \nStock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards and purchase rights issued under our ESPP is measured at fair value on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Stock-based compensation expense for performance-based awards is measured at fair value on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation option-pricing model or other valuation technique depending on the nature of the award. Awards that are classified as liabilities are remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. These valuation methods require inputs that are based on estimates, which are highly subjective.\nEstimates used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model include:\nExpected term\n \n\u2013 Represents the period that stock option awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term for stock option awards is determined using the simplified method. The simplified method deems the term to be the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the stock-based awards.\nExpected volatility\n \n\u2013 The expected volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock. \nRisk-free interest rate\n \u2013 \nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of stock option awards for periods corresponding with the expected term of the option.\nExpected dividend yield\n \u2013 \nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe recognize the compensation costs for stock option awards, purchase rights issued under our ESPP, and market-based RSUs over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term, reduced for estimated forfeitures at the date of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on the historical experience. We recognize compensation costs for performance-based awards over the vesting period if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee \u201cThe Company and its Significant Accounting Policies\u201d Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of June\u00a030, 2023.\n74",
    "item7a": ">Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \nOur overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments and funds held for customers.\n Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and investment-grade fixed income marketable securities. These assets are available for corporate operating purposes and mature within 24 months from the date of purchase. Our customer funds assets are invested with safety of principal as the primary objective. As secondary objectives, we seek to provide liquidity and diversification and maximize interest income. Our customer funds assets are invested in money market funds that maintain a constant net asset value, other cash equivalents, and highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income marketable securities, with maturities of up to 13 months from the time of purchase. Our investment policy governs the types of investments we make. We classify all of our investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale. \nAs part of our customer funds investment strategy, we use funds collected daily from our customers to satisfy the obligations of other unrelated customers, rather than liquidating investments purchased with previously collected funds. There is risk that we may not be able to satisfy customer obligations in full or on time due to insufficient liquidity or due to a decline in value of our investments. However, the liquidity risk is minimized by collecting the customer\u2019s funds in advance of the payment obligation and by maintaining significant investments in bank deposits and constant net asset value money market funds that allow for same-day liquidity. The risk of a decline in investment value is minimized by our restrictive investment policy allowing for only short-term, high quality fixed income marketable securities. We also maintain other sources of liquidity including our corporate cash balances.\nInterest Rate and Credit Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investments of corporate cash and funds held for customers that we process through our bank accounts. Our corporate investment portfolio consists principally of interest-bearing bank deposits, money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, other corporate notes, asset-backed securities, and U.S. Treasury securities. Funds that we hold for customers are held in non-interest and interest-bearing bank deposits, money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, other corporate notes, and U.S. Treasury securities. We recognize interest earned from funds held for customers as revenue. We do not pay interest to customers. \nFactors that influence the rate of interest we earn include the short-term market interest rate environment and the weighting of our balances by security type. The annualized interest rate earned on our corporate investment portfolio and funds held for customers increased to 3.51% during fiscal 2023 compared to 0.29% during fiscal 2022 due primarily to the changes in the short-term interest rate environment during fiscal 2023. \nUnrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are due primarily to interest rate fluctuations from the time the securities were purchased. We account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) since we classify our marketable debt securities as available for sale. Our investments in marketable debt securities are generally held through maturity with minimal sales before maturity barring unforeseen circumstances, and thus unrealized gains or losses on fixed-income securities from market interest rate decreases or increases are not realized as the securities mature at par.\nWe are also exposed to interest-rate risk relating to borrowings from our Revolving Credit Facility. As of June\u00a030, 2023, we borrowed $135.0 million from our Revolving Credit Facility. Because the interest rate on our borrowings is indexed to SOFR, which is a floating rate mechanism, our interest cost may increase if market interest rates rise. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results. \nIn addition to interest rate risks, we also have exposure to risks associated with changes in laws and regulations that may affect customer fund balances. For example, a change in regulations that restricts the permissible investment alternatives for customer funds would reduce our interest earned revenue.\nWe are exposed to credit risk in connection with our investments in securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade \n75\nsecurities as rated by Moody\u2019s, Standard & Poor\u2019s, or Fitch, by investing only in securities that mature in the near-term, and by limiting concentration in securities other than U.S. Treasuries. Investment in securities of issuers with short-term credit ratings must be rated A-2/P-2/F2 or higher. Investment in securities of issuers with long-term credit ratings must be rated A- or A3, or higher. Investment in asset-backed securities and money market funds must be rated AAA or equivalent. Investment in repurchase agreements will be at least 102 percent collateralized with securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. Securities in our corporate portfolio may not mature beyond two years from purchase, and securities held in our customer fund accounts may not mature beyond 13 months from purchase. No more than 5% of invested funds, either corporate or customer, may be held in the issues of a single corporation.\nWe are also exposed to credit risk related to the timing of payments made from customer funds collected. We typically remit customer funds to our customers\u2019 suppliers in advance of having good or confirmed funds collected from our customers and if a customer disputes a transaction after we remit funds on their behalf, then we could suffer a credit loss. Furthermore, our customers generally have three days to dispute transactions, and if we remit funds in advance of receiving confirmation that no dispute was initiated by our customer, then we could suffer a credit loss. We mitigate this credit exposure by leveraging our data assets to make credit underwriting decisions about whether to accelerate disbursements, managing exposure limits, and various controls in our operating systems.\nWe continually evaluate the credit quality of the securities in our portfolios. If a security holding is downgraded below our credit rating threshold or we otherwise believe the security\u2019s payment performance may be compromised, we will evaluate the relevant risks, remaining time to maturity, amount of principal, as well as other factors, and we will make a determination of whether to continue to hold the security or promptly sell it.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from card receivable balances we have with our spending businesses. Spending businesses may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure, or other reasons. Although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific spending businesses and to specific industries that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. In addition, our ability to manage credit risk or collect amounts owed to us may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes (such as restrictions on collections or changes in bankruptcy laws, and minimum payment regulations). We rely principally on the creditworthiness of spending businesses for repayment of card receivables and therefore have limited recourse for collection. Our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk prove inaccurate in predicting future losses, which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us. Although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of card receivables, these estimates may differ from actual losses.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk \nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk relating to our cross-border payment service, which allows customers to pay their international suppliers in foreign currencies. When customers make a cross-border payment, customers fund those payments in U.S. dollars based upon an exchange rate that is quoted on the initiation date of the transaction. Subsequently, when we convert and remit those funds to our customers\u2019 suppliers primarily through our global payment partners, the exchange rate may differ, due to foreign exchange fluctuation, from the exchange rate that was initially quoted. Our transaction fees to our customers are not adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates between the initiation date of the transaction and the date the funds are converted. \nWe are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk relating to the operations of our subsidiaries in Australia and Canada. A change in foreign currency exchange rate can affect our financial results due to transaction gains or losses related to the remeasurement of certain monetary asset and monetary liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our Australian and Canadian subsidiaries, which are both in U.S. dollars. \nIf the value of the U.S. dollar weakens relative to the foreign currencies, this may have an unfavorable effect on our cash flows and operating results. We do not believe that a 10% change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other foreign currencies would have a material effect on our cash flows and operating results.\n76\nInflation Risk \nWe do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our cash flows and operating results during fiscal 2023. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through increase in prices of our product offerings. \nThe Inflation Reduction Act was enacted on August 16, 2022 and includes a number of provisions that may impact us in the future. We have assessed these impacts for the current reporting period, and conclude that the new law does not have a material impact on our fiscal 2023 financial statements. \n77",
