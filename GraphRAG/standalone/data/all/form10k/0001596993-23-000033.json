We use the term \"VLGC\" to refer to very large gas carriers. We use the term \"LPG\" to refer to liquefied petroleum gas and we use the term \"cbm\" to refer to cubic meters in describing the carrying capacity of our vessels. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to \"U.S. dollars,\" \"USD,\" and \"$\" in this report are to the lawful currency of the United States of America and references to \"Norwegian Krone\" and \"NOK\" are to the lawful currency of Norway. \n\u200b\nOverview \n\u200b\nDorian was incorporated on July 1, 2013 under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is headquartered in the United States and is engaged in the transportation of LPG. Specifically, Dorian and its subsidiaries are focused on owning and operating VLGCs in the LPG shipping industry. Our founding executives have managed vessels in the LPG shipping market since 2002. Our fleet currently consists of twenty-five VLGCs, including one dual-fuel 84,000 cbm ECO-design VLGC, or our Dual-fuel ECO VLGC; nineteen fuel-efficient 84,000 cbm ECO-design VLGCs, or our ECO VLGCs; one 82,000 cbm modern VLGC; two time chartered dual fuel Panamax size VLGCs; and two time chartered-in ECO VLGCs. The twenty-five VLGCs in our fleet, including the four time chartered-in vessels, as of May 25, 2023, have an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately 2.1 million cbm and an average age of 7.2 years. Currently, thirteen of our ECO VLGCs, including one of our time chartered-in ECO-VLGCs, are fitted with exhaust gas cleaning systems (commonly referred to as \u201cscrubbers\u201d) to reduce sulfur emissions. An additional three of our technically-managed VLGCs had contractual commitments to be equipped with scrubbers as of March 31, 2023. Installation of scrubbers on two of the vessels is expected to be completed during our fiscal year 2024 and one during our fiscal year 2025. We provide in-house commercial and technical management services for all of our vessels, including our vessels deployed in the Helios Pool, which may also receive commercial management services from Phoenix (defined below). Excluding our time chartered-in vessels, we provide in-house technical management services for all of our vessels, including our vessels deployed in the Helios Pool.\n\u200b\nOn April 1, 2015, we and Phoenix Tankers Pte. Ltd., or Phoenix, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd., an unaffiliated third party, began operation of Helios LPG Pool LLC, or the Helios Pool, a joint venture owned 50% by us and 50% by Phoenix. We believe that the operation of certain of our VLGCs in this pool allows us to achieve better market coverage and utilization. Vessels entered into the Helios Pool are commercially managed jointly by Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Phoenix. The members of the Helios Pool share in the net pool revenues generated by the entire group of vessels participating in the pool, weighted according to certain technical vessel characteristics, and net pool revenues are distributed as variable rate time charter hire to each participant. The vessels entered into the Helios Pool may operate either in the spot market, pursuant to contracts of affreightment, or COAs, or on time charters of two years' duration or less. \nWe and Phoenix have agreed that the Helios Pool will have a right of first refusal to undertake any time charter with an original duration greater than two years. As of May 25, 2023, the Helios Pool operated twenty-seven VLGCs, including twenty-three vessels from our fleet and four Phoenix vessels.\n\u200b\n1\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur Fleet\n\u200b\nThe

Traditionally the main trading route in our industry has been the transport of LPG from the Arabian Gulf to Asia. With the emergence of the United States as a major LPG export hub, the United States Gulf to Asia and United States to Europe have become important trade routes. Vessels are generally operated under time charters, bareboat charters, spot charters, or COAs. LPG distributors and traders use their fleets not only to transport their own LPG, but also to transport LPG for third-party charterers in direct competition with independent owners and operators in the tanker charter market. We operate in markets that are highly competitive and based primarily on supply and demand of available vessels. Generally, we compete for charters based upon charter rate, customer relationships, operating expertise, professional reputation and vessel specifications (size, age and condition). We also believe that our in-house technical and commercial management allows us to provide superior customer service and reliability that enhances our relationships with our charterers. Our industry is subject to strict environmental regulation, including the treatment of ballast water and greenhouse gas emissions regulations, and we believe our modern, ECO-class fleet and our high level of crew training and vessel maintenance make us a preferred provider of VLGC tonnage. For more information with respect to the aforementioned environmental regulations, please see \u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Environmental and Other Regulation in the Shipping Industry.\u201d\nOur Customers\n\u200b\nOur customers, either directly or through the Helios Pool, include or have included global energy companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., China International United Petroleum & Chemicals Co., Ltd., Royal Dutch Shell plc, Equinor ASA, Total S.A., and Sunoco LP, commodity traders such as Glencore plc, Itochu Corporation, Bayegan Group, and the Vitol Group and importers such as E1 Corp., Indian Oil Corporation, SK Gas Co. Ltd., and Astomos Energy Corporation, or subsidiaries of the foregoing. See \u201cItem 7. Management Discussion and Analysis\u2014Overview\u201d for a discussion of our customers that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues and \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014We expect to be dependent on a limited number of customers for a material part of our revenues, and failure of such customers to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\u201d For the years ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023, 2022 and 2021 approximately 94%, 90% and 93% of our revenues, respectively, were generated through the Helios Pool as net pool revenues\u2014related party. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014We and the Helios Pool operate exclusively in the VLGC segment of the LPG shipping industry. Due to the general lack of industry diversification, adverse developments in the LPG shipping industry may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\u201d\n\u200b\nWe intend to continue to pursue a balanced chartering strategy by employing our vessels on a mix of multi-year time charters, some of which may include a profit-sharing component, shorter-term time charters, spot market voyages and COAs. Two of our vessels are currently on fixed time charters outside of the Helios Pool with an average remaining term of 1.1 years as of May 25, 2023, and six of our VLGCs are on Pool-TCO within the Helios Pool. See \u201cOur Fleet\u201d above for more information.\n\u200b\nFurther, each of our vessels serves the same type of customer, has similar operations and maintenance requirements, and operates in the same regulatory environment. Based on this, we have determined that we operate in one reportable segment, the international transportation of LPG. Furthermore, when we charter a vessel to a charterer, the charterer is free to trade the vessel worldwide (subject to applicable laws and sanctions regimes) and, as a result, the disclosure of geographic information is impracticable.\n\u200b\nCompetition\n\u200b\nLPG carrier capacity is primarily a function of the size of the existing world fleet, the number of newbuildings being delivered and the scrapping of older vessels. According to industry sources, in the VLGC sector in which we operate as of May 22, 2023, there were 372 vessels with an aggregate carrying capacity of 18.0 million cbm in the world fleet and 74 vessels with 6.6 million cbm of capacity on order for delivery by the end of 2027.\n\u200b\n3\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur largest competitors for VLGC shipping services include BW LPG Ltd., or BWLPG; Avance Gas Holding Ltd., or Avance; Petredec Pte. Ltd., or Petredec; and KSS Line Limited. According to industry sources, there were approximately 104 owners in the worldwide VLGC fleet as of May 22, 2023, with the top ten owners possessing 41% of the total fleet on a vessel count basis. Competition for the transportation of LPG depends on the price, vessel position, size, age, condition and acceptability of the vessel to the charterer. We believe we own and operate one of the youngest and the second largest fleet in the VLGC size segment, which, in our view, enhances our position relative to that of our competitors. Our twenty-one VLGCs (excluding the four-time chartered-in vessels) have an average age of 8.0 years compared to the global VLGC fleet\u2019s average age of 10.8 years. Refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014We face substantial competition in trying to expand relationships with existing customers and obtain new customers.\u201d\n\u200b\nSeasonality\n\u200b\nLiquefied gases are primarily used for industrial and domestic heating, as chemical and refinery feedstock, as transportation fuel and in agriculture. The LPG shipping market historically has been stronger in the spring and summer months in anticipation of increased consumption of propane and butane for heating during the winter months. In addition, unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and the supply of certain commodities. Demand for our vessels therefore may be stronger in our quarters ending June 30 and September 30 and relatively weaker during our quarters ending December 31 and March 31, although 12-month time charter rates tend to smooth out these short-term fluctuations and recent LPG shipping market activity has not yielded the typical seasonal results. The increase in pertochemical industry buying has contributed to less marked seasonality than in the past, but there can no guarantee that this trend will continue. To the extent any of our time charters expire during the typically weaker fiscal quarters ending December 31 and March 31, it may not be possible to re-charter our vessels at similar rates. As a result, we may have to accept lower rates or experience off-hire time for our vessels, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\u200b\nHuman Capital\n\u200b\nAs of March\u00a031,\u00a02023, we employed 82 shore-based persons in our offices in the United States, Greece, and Denmark, and had approximately 511 seafaring staff serving on our technically-managed vessels. Seafarers are sourced from seafarer recruitment and placement service agencies and are employed with short-term employment contracts.\n\u200b\nWe recognize that the success of our Company is dependent upon the talents and dedication of our staff, and we are committed to investing in their success. We focus on attracting, developing and retaining a team of highly talented and motivated individuals. We conduct periodic assessments of our pay and benefit practices to help ensure that staff members are compensated fairly and competitively. The Company provides competitive compensation and benefits. In addition to salaries for our shore-based employees, our compensation programs typically include annual bonuses, stock-based compensation awards, company-sponsored retirement savings plans with employer matching opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, life insurance, paid time off, family leave, and employee assistance programs.\n\u200b\nThe health and safety of our staff is of paramount importance to us. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, we responded by prioritizing the safety and well-being of our staff through the implementation of strict COVID-19 safety checks and medical support to mitigate the related health risks on our vessels. For the Company\u2019s shoreside offices and operations, we implemented various health and safety measures intended to address COVID-19 and other public health concerns. In spite of the end of the COVID-19 public health crisis, we continue to maintain be vigilant of the health of our seafarers and have resources in place to respond to any outbreaks of COVID 19.\n\u200b\nWe support meaningful learning and development opportunities. We have formal and informal training programs available and offer reimbursement for qualified advanced education programs, workshops, conferences, forums and certifications, and other classes.\n\u200b\nIn February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. We employ Ukrainian and Russian seafarers and, as stated above in our discussion about COVID-19, the health and safety of our staff and seafarers is of paramount importance to us. During \n4\n\n\nTable of Contents\nthe conflict we began providing our Ukrainian and Russian seafarers, if they choose, with safe accommodation outside of Ukraine and Russia for both them and their families. \n\u200b\nWe attempt to honor the dignity of each person by fostering a culture of inclusion. We do this by embracing diverse voices and experiences, supporting programs and resources that build an authentic and respectful workplace, and providing fair and equitable opportunities for each person to contribute meaningfully. We believe our workforce needs to be diverse, which, in turn, enables us to innovate, collaborate and better deliver to our customers. Additionally, we have joined the All Aboard Alliance and, together with other industry leaders, we are committed to have a sustainable, progressive, and innovative maritime industry that we can all be proud of with increased diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout organizations across the sector both at sea and onshore.\n\u200b\nClassification, Inspection and Maintenance \n\u200b\nEvery large commercial seagoing vessel must be \u201cclassed\u201d by a classification society. A classification society certifies that a vessel is \u201cin class,\u201d signifying that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and the vessel\u2019s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the classification society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned.\n\u200b\nFor maintenance of the class certificate, regular and special surveys of hull, machinery, including the electrical plant and any special equipment classed, are required to be performed by the classification society, to ensure continuing compliance. The classification societies provide guidelines applicable to LPG vessels relating to extended intervals for drydocking. Every vessel is required to be drydocked every 30 to 36 months for inspection of the underwater parts of the vessel. However, for vessels not exceeding 15 years that have means to facilitate underwater inspection in lieu of drydocking, the drydocking can be skipped and be conducted concurrently with the special survey. Certain cargo vessels that meet the system requirements set by classification societies may qualify for extended drydocking, which extends the 5-year period to 7.5 years, by replacing certain dry-dockings with in-water surveys. If any defects are found, the classification surveyor will issue a \"recommendation\" which must be rectified by the shipowner within prescribed time limits. The classification society also undertakes on request of the flag state other surveys and checks that are required by the regulations and requirements of that flag state. These surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and/or to the regulations of the country concerned. If any vessel does not maintain its class and/or fails any annual survey, intermediate survey, drydocking or special survey, the vessel will be unable to carry cargo between ports and will be unemployable and uninsurable which could cause us to be in violation of certain covenants in our loan agreements and financing arrangements. Any such inability to carry cargo or be employed, or any such violation of covenants, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u200b\nMost insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage and lending that a vessel be certified as \u201cin class\u201d by a classification society, which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies, or the IACS. In December 2013, the IACS adopted harmonized Common Structure Rules, or \u201cthe Rules,\u201d that align with International Maritime Organization, the United Nations agency for maritime safety and the prevention of pollution by vessels, or the IMO, goal standards and apply to oil tankers and bulk carriers contracted for construction on or after July 1, 2015. The Rules attempt to create a level of consistency between IACS Societies. Our VLGCs are currently classed with either Lloyd\u2019s Register, the American Bureau of Shipping, or ABS, or Det Norske Veritas, all members of the IACS. All of the vessels in our fleet have been awarded International Safety Management, or ISM, certification and are currently \u201cin class.\u201d\n\u200b\nWe also carry out inspections of the ships, including with a view towards compliance under the Ship Inspection Report Programme (\u201cSIRE\u201d) and United States Coast Guard (\u201cUSCG\u201d) requirements, as applicable, on a regular basis; both at sea and while the vessels are in port. The results of these inspections are documented in a report containing recommendations for improvements to the overall condition of the vessel, maintenance, safety and crew welfare. Based in part on these evaluations, we create and implement a program of continual maintenance and improvement for our vessels and their systems.\n\u200b\n5\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSafety, Management of Ship Operations and Administration\n\u200b\nSafety is our top operational priority. Our vessels are operated in a manner intended to protect the safety and health of the crew, the general public and the environment. We actively manage the risks inherent in our business and are committed to preventing incidents that threaten safety, such as groundings, fires and collisions. We are also committed to reducing emissions and waste generation. We have established key performance indicators to facilitate regular monitoring of our operational performance. We set targets on an annual basis to drive continuous improvement, and we review performance indicators every three months to determine if remedial action is necessary to reach our targets. Our shore staff performs a full range of technical, commercial and business development services for us. This staff also provides administrative support to our operations in finance, accounting and human resources.\n\u200b\nRisk of Loss and Insurance\n\u200b\nThe operation of any vessel, including LPG carriers, has inherent risks. These risks include mechanical failure, personal injury, crew negligence, human error, collision, property loss, vessel or cargo loss or damage, cyber-attacks, and business interruption due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities or piracy. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of marine disaster, including explosions, spills and other environmental mishaps, and the liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade. OPA 90, which imposes virtually unlimited liability upon shipowners, operators and bareboat charterers of any vessel trading in the exclusive economic zone of the United States for certain oil pollution accidents in the United States, has made liability insurance more expensive for shipowners and operators trading in the United States market. Having said that, we believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate to protect us against the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of our business and that we maintain appropriate levels of environmental damage and pollution insurance coverage consistent with standard industry practice. Additionally, we maintain other insurance policies we believe are customary and are in amounts we believe to be adequate to protect us against material loss. The policies principally provide coverage for general liability, directors and officers, workers\u2019 compensation, and insurance against the consequences of a cyber-attack. However, not all risks can be insured against, and there can be no guarantee that any specific claim will be paid, or that we will always be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at acceptable rates.\n\u200b\nThe types of insurances we have purchased can be categorized as follows: \n\u200b\n\u25cf\nDamage to or loss of the ships themselves;\n\u25cf\nLiability to cargo owners for damage to or loss of cargo, for injury to or death of crew or third-parties, for collision with other ships or objects, for pollution damage, for fines and other liabilities;\n\u25cf\nCompensation for loss of income in periods when ships undergo repairs due to damage;\n\u25cf\nCompensation for legal expenses in defending against contract claims or in collecting money due;\n\u25cf\nCompensation for damage to IT equipment ashore and onboard the ships in the case of a cyber-attack and of loss suffered from resulting business interruption; and\n\u25cf\nNon-marine coverage, e.g. directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. \n\u200b\nWe have procured insurances on all our vessels against marine and war risks, both of which include the risks of damage to our vessels, salvage or towing costs, and actual or constructive total loss. The insured value of the ships is fixed and will adequately compensate for repair to a damaged ship or replacement of a lost ship. However, our insurance policies contain deductible amounts for which we are responsible. \u00a0\n\u200b\nTo supplement these insurances, we have also obtained loss of hire insurance to protect against loss of income in the event one of our vessels cannot be employed due to damage that is covered under the terms of our hull and machinery insurance (marine and war risks). Under our loss of hire policies, our insurers will pay us an agreed daily amount for the time that the vessel is out of service as a result of damage, for a maximum of 180 days following a 7 days deductible period.\n\u200b\nWe have procured protection and indemnity insurance (\u201cP&I\u201d), which covers legal liabilities to third-parties in connection with operating our ships, and is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations, or P&I clubs. This insurance includes third-party liability and other expenses related to the injury or death of crew members, passengers and \n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\nother third parties, loss or damage to cargo, claims arising from collisions with other vessels or from contact with jetties or wharves and other damage to other third-party property, including pollution arising from oil or other substances, and other related costs, including wreck removal. Subject to the capping discussed below, our coverage, except for pollution, is unlimited.\n\u200b\nOur current P&I coverage for pollution liability is $1.0 billion per vessel per incident. The thirteen P&I clubs that comprise the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Clubs, or the International Group, insure approximately 90% of the world's commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association's liabilities. We are a member of four P&I clubs: The Standard Club Ireland DAC, The United Kingdom Mutual Steamship Assurance Association Limited, Assuranceforeningen Gard and The London Steam\u2011Ship Owners' Mutual Insurance Association Limited. All four P&I clubs are members of the International Group of P&I Clubs. As a member of these P&I clubs, we are \u2013 in addition to the annual premiums (called \u201cadvanced calls\u201d) - subject to potential additional premiums (called \u201csupplemental calls\u201d), based on each club\u2019s over-all claims record, as well as \u2013 due to the mutual reinsurance arrangement between the clubs - the claims record of the other members of the P&I clubs comprising the International Group. However, the International Group of P&I Clubs has reinsured part of the risk of additional premium calls to limit additional exposure. \n\u200b\nWe believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate, but not all risks can be insured, and there is the possibility that any specific claim may not be paid, or that we will not always be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates. If the damages from a catastrophic spill exceeded our insurance coverage, the effect on our business would be severe and could possibly result in our insolvency.\n\u200b\nOur Environmental, Social and Governance Efforts\n\u200b\nAs one of the leaders in the international transportation of LPG, we are committed to delivering cleaner-burning energy in a safe, reliable and environmentally efficient manner. LPG is a clean, efficient and readily available source of energy, with positive benefits to the environment relative to other fuels. While extending the economic and social benefits of delivering LPG to consumers across the globe, we recognize that the shipping industry is heavily dependent on the burning of fossil fuels, contributing to the warming of the world\u2019s climate system. In providing our services, we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions. We welcome and support efforts to increase transparency and to promote investors\u2019 understanding of how we and our industry peers are addressing the climate change-related risks and opportunities. We have disclosed certain ESG-related information on our website, including our first ESG Report, aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Marine Transportation standard, additionally taking into account recommendations provided by the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The report includes information on how we monitor, manage and perform on material ESG issues in the face of increasing expectations and regulations. Our ESG Report may be found on our website at www.dorianlpg.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K (\u201cAnnual Report\u201d).\n\u200b\nDorian\u2019s ESG strategies, risks and initiatives are overseen by our board of directors (the \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d), which includes independent members and experts in shipping and compliance matters. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee monitors progress of ESG efforts and together with management ensures integrity of reporting. The Company\u2019s executive leadership team, led by our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr. John C. Hadjipateras, formulates ESG strategies and drives initiatives, while the members of our management set targets, assesses risks, develops policies and procedures and executes the ESG efforts. Some of the ESG initiatives that we have undertaken include:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\noperating newer, more technologically advanced ECO vessels, with very low revolutions per minute, long-stroke, electronically controlled engines, larger propellers, advanced hull design, and low friction paint, resulting in enhanced the energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions on a ton-mile basis, including the vessels in our existing fleet, our newbuilding dual-fuel VLGC delivered from Kawasaki Heavy Industries in March 2023, and our two time chartered in Dual Fuel VLGCs that entered our fleet in February and March 2023;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nfitting vessels with scrubbers to reduce sulfur emissions to, among other things, comply with the IMO\u2019s new fuel regulations which went into effect in January 2020;\n\u200b\n7\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\njoining the Getting to Zero Coalition, a global alliance of more than 140 companies committed to the decarbonization of deep-sea shipping in line with the IMO greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy; \n\u200b\n\u25cf\ncreating teams and a formal reporting structure for the evaluation and potential implementation of new energy saving technologies such as batteries, hull friction reducing technologies, and a range of other applications;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nimplementing and utilizing internal and third-party data collection and analysis software, which allows data to be gathered from our vessels for use in performance optimization, with the aim of reducing our fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nincluding a sustainability-linked pricing mechanism in our 2022 Debt Facility (as defined below) and providing relevant carbon emissions data for the vessels in our fleet that are owned or technically managed pursuant to a bareboat charter to our lenders in connection with the Poseidon Principles, which establish a framework for assessing and disclosing the climate alignment of ship finance portfolios with the IMO\u2019s target to reduce shipping's total annual greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2050;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nbecoming a signatory to the Neptune Declaration on Seafarer Wellbeing and Crew Change, in a worldwide call to action to end the unprecedented crew change crisis caused by COVID-19;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nestablishing risk management and internal control policies and systems to manage risk and ensure compliance with all applicable international and local laws; and\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nestablishing compliance programs to meet or exceed, when possible and appropriate, all applicable rules and regulations governing the maritime industry, including the items described in the \u201cEnvironmental and Other Regulation in the Shipping Industry\u201d section below.\n\u200b\nEnvironmental and Other Regulation in the Shipping Industry \n\u200b\nGeneral \n\u200b\nGovernment regulations and laws significantly affect the ownership and operation of our fleet. We are subject to international conventions and treaties, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which our vessels may operate or are registered relating to safety and health and environmental protection including the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination and liability for damage to natural resources. Compliance with such laws, regulations and other requirements entails significant expense, including vessel modifications and implementation of certain operating procedures. \n\u200b\nA variety of government and private entities subject our vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These entities include the local port authorities (applicable national authorities such as the USCG, harbor master or equivalent), classification societies, flag state administrations (countries of registry) and charterers, particularly terminal operators. Certain of these entities require us to obtain permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations for the operation of our vessels. Failure to maintain necessary permits or approvals could require us to incur substantial costs or result in the temporary suspension of the operation of one or more of our vessels.\n\u200b\nIncreasing environmental concerns have created a demand for vessels that conform to stricter environmental standards. We are required to maintain operating standards for all of our vessels that emphasize operational safety, quality maintenance, continuous training of our officers and crews and compliance with United States and international regulations. We believe that the operation of our vessels is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our vessels have all material permits, licenses, certificates or other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations. However, because such laws and regulations frequently change and may impose increasingly stricter requirements, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements, or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. In addition, a future serious marine incident that causes \n8\n\n\nTable of Contents\nsignificant adverse environmental impact could result in additional legislation or regulation that could negatively affect our profitability.\n\u200b\nInternational Maritime Organization\nThe International Maritime Organization, the United Nations agency for maritime safety and the prevention of pollution by vessels (the \u201cIMO\u201d), has adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto, collectively referred to as MARPOL 73/78 and herein as \u201cMARPOL,\u201d the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974 (\u201cSOLAS Convention\u201d), and the International Convention on Load Lines of 1966 (the \u201cLL Convention\u201d). MARPOL establishes environmental standards relating to oil leakage or spilling, garbage management, sewage, air emissions, handling and disposal of noxious liquids and the handling of harmful substances in packaged forms. MARPOL is applicable to LPG carriers as well as other vessels, and is broken into six Annexes, each of which regulates a different source of pollution. Annex I relates to oil leakage or spilling; Annexes II and III relate to harmful substances carried in bulk in liquid or in packaged form, respectively; Annexes IV and V relate to sewage and garbage management, respectively; and Annex VI, lastly, relates to air emissions. Annex VI was separately adopted by the IMO in September of 1997; new emissions standards, titled IMO-2020, took effect on January 1, 2020.\nVessels that transport gas, including LPG carriers, are also subject to regulation under the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk, or the \u201cIGC Code,\u201d published by the IMO. The IGC Code provides a standard for the safe carriage of LPG and certain other liquid gases by prescribing the design and construction standards of vessels involved in such carriage. The completely revised and updated IGC Code entered into force in 2016, and the amendments were developed following a comprehensive five-year review and are intended to take into account the latest advances in science and technology. Compliance with the IGC Code must be evidenced by a Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Liquefied Gases in Bulk. Non-compliance with the IGC Code or other applicable IMO regulations may subject a shipowner or a bareboat charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. We believe that each of our vessels is in compliance with the IGC Code.\n\u200b\nOur LPG vessels may also become subject to the 2010 HNS Convention, if it is entered into force. The Convention creates a regime of liability and compensation for damage from hazardous and noxious substances (\u201cHNS\u201d), including liquefied gases. The 2010 HNS Convention establishes that the polluter pays by ensuring that the shipping and HNS industries provide compensation for those who have suffered loss or damage resulting from an HNS incident. The following types of damage will be covered by the 2010 HNS Convention: loss of life or personal injury on board or outside the ship carrying the HNS; loss of or damage to property outside the ship; economic losses resulting from contamination, e.g. in the fishing, mariculture and tourism sectors; costs of preventive measures, e.g. clean-up operations at sea and onshore; and costs of reasonable measures of reinstatement of the environment. Shipowners will be held strictly liable up to a maximum limit of liability for the cost of an HNS incident and are required to have insurance that is State certified. The 2010 HNS Convention sets up a two-tier system of compensation composed of compulsory insurance taken out by shipowners and an HNS Fund which comes into play when the insurance is insufficient to satisfy a claim or does not cover the incident. Under the 2010 HNS Convention, if damage is caused by bulk HNS, claims for compensation will first be sought from the shipowner up to a maximum of 100 million Special Drawing Rights (\u201cSDR\u201d). If the damage is caused by packaged HNS or by both bulk and packaged HNS, the maximum liability is 115 million SDR. Once the limit is reached, compensation will be paid from the HNS Fund up to a maximum of 250 million SDR. The 2010 HNS Convention will enter into force 18 months after the date on which it is ratified by at least twelve States, four of which must each have a merchant have a merchant shipping fleet of no less than 2 million units of gross tonnage, and having received during the preceding calendar year a total quantity of at least 40 million tons of cargo that would be contributing to the general account. To date, six states (South Africa, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Norway and Turkey) have ratified and consented to be bound by the 2010 HNS Convention. Although the 2010 HNS Convention has not been ratified by a sufficient number of countries to enter into force, we cannot estimate the costs that may be needed to comply with any such requirements that may be adopted with any certainty at this time.\n\u200b\nIn June 2015 the IMO formally adopted the International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or Low flashpoint Fuels, or the \u201cIGF Code,\u201d which is designed to minimize the risks involved with ships using low flashpoint fuels. The IGF \n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCode will be mandatory under SOLAS through the adopted amendments. The IGF Code and the amendments to SOLAS became effective January 1, 2017. In June 2022, the IGF Code was amended to address cofferdams for fire protection, safe fuel distribution outside machinery spaces, fire protection between spaces with fuel with fuel containment systems, and fixed fire-extinguishing systems in LNG fuel preparation spaces. These amendments will enter into force on January 1, 2024.\n\u200b\nAir Emissions\n\u200b\nIn September of 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to MARPOL to address air pollution from vessels. Effective May 2005, Annex VI sets limits on sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from all commercial vessel exhausts and prohibits \u201cdeliberate emissions\u201d of ozone depleting substances (such as halons and chlorofluorocarbons), emissions of volatile compounds from cargo tanks and the shipboard incineration of specific substances. Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions, as explained below. Emissions of \u201cvolatile organic compounds\u201d from certain vessels, and the shipboard incineration (from incinerators installed after January 1, 2000) of certain substances (such as polychlorinated biphenyls, or \u201cPCBs\u201d) are also prohibited. We believe that all our vessels are currently compliant in all material respects with these regulations.\n \nThe Marine Environment Protection Committee, or \u201cMEPC,\u201d adopted amendments to Annex VI regarding emissions of sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter and ozone depleting substances, which entered into force on July 1, 2010. The amended Annex VI seeks to further reduce air pollution by, among other things, implementing a progressive reduction of the amount of sulfur contained in any fuel oil used on board ships. On October 27, 2016, at its 70th session, the MEPC agreed to implement a global 0.5% m/m sulfur oxide emissions limit (reduced from 3.50%) starting from January 1, 2020 (the \u201cIMO 2020 Cap\u201d). This limitation can be met by using low-sulfur compliant fuel oil, alternative fuels or certain scrubbers. Ships are now required to obtain bunker delivery notes and International Air Pollution Prevention (\u201cIAPP\u201d) Certificates from their flag states that specify sulfur content. Additionally, at MEPC 73, amendments to Annex VI to prohibit the carriage of bunkers above 0.5% sulfur on ships were adopted and took effect March 1, 2020, with the exception of vessels fitted with scrubbers which can carry fuel of higher sulfur content. These regulations subject ocean-going vessels to stringent emissions controls and may cause us to incur substantial costs.\nSulfur content standards are even stricter within certain \u201cEmission Control Areas,\u201d or (\u201cECAs\u201d). As of January 1, 2015, ships operating within an ECA were not permitted to use fuel with sulfur content in excess of 0.1% m/m. Amended Annex VI establishes procedures for designating new ECAs. Currently, the IMO has designated four ECAs, including specified portions of the Baltic Sea area, North Sea area, North American area and United States Caribbean area. Ocean-going vessels in these areas will be subject to stringent emission controls and may cause us to incur additional costs. Other areas in China are subject to local regulations that impose stricter emission controls. In December 2021, the member states of the Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea Against Pollution agreed to support the designation of a new ECA in the Mediterranean.\n \nOn December 15, 2022, MEPC 79 adopted the designation of a new ECA in the Mediterranean, with an effective date of May 1, 2025. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO, or other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) or the states where we operate, compliance with these regulations could entail significant capital expenditures or otherwise increase the costs of our operations.\nAmended Annex VI also establishes new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for marine diesel engines, depending on their date of installation. At the MEPC meeting held from March to April 2014, amendments to Annex VI were adopted which address the date on which Tier III Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) standards in ECAs will go into effect. Under the amendments, Tier III NOx standards apply to ships that operate in the North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECAs designed for the control of NOx produced by vessels with a marine diesel engine installed and constructed on or after January 1, 2016. Tier III requirements could apply to areas that will be designated for Tier III NOx in the future. At MEPC 70 and MEPC 71, the MEPC approved the North Sea and Baltic Sea as ECAs for nitrogen oxide for ships built on or after January 1, 2021. The EPA promulgated equivalent (and in some senses stricter) emissions standards in 2010. As a result of these designations or similar future designations, we may be required to incur additional operating or other costs.\n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAs determined at the MEPC 70, the new Regulation 22A of MARPOL Annex VI became effective as of March 1, 2018 and requires ships above 5,000 gross tonnage to collect and report annual data on fuel oil consumption to an IMO database, with the first year of data collection having commenced on January 1, 2019. The IMO intends to use such data as the first step in its roadmap (through 2023) for developing its strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships, as discussed further below.\nAs of January 1, 2013, MARPOL made mandatory certain measures relating to energy efficiency for ships. All ships are now required to develop and implement Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans (\u201cSEEMP\u201d), and new ships must be designed in compliance with minimum energy efficiency levels per capacity mile as defined by the Energy Efficiency Design Index (\u201cEEDI\u201d). Under these measures, by 2025, all new ships built will be 30% more energy efficient than those built in 2014. MEPC 75 adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI which brings forward the effective date of the EEDI\u2019s \u201cphase 3\u201d requirements from January 1, 2025 to April 1, 2022 for several ship types, including gas carriers, general cargo ships, and LNG carriers.\nAdditionally, MEPC 75 introduced draft amendments to Annex VI which impose new regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. These amendments introduce requirements to assess and measure the energy efficiency of all ships and set the required attainment values, with the goal of reducing the carbon intensity of international shipping. The requirements include (1) a technical requirement to reduce carbon intensity based on a new Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (\u201cEEXI\u201d), and (2) operational carbon intensity reduction requirements, based on a new operational carbon intensity indicator (\u201cCII\u201d). The attained EEXI is required to be calculated for ships of 400 gross tonnage and above, in accordance with different values set for ship types and categories. With respect to the CII, the draft amendments would require ships of 5,000 gross tonnage to document and verify their actual annual operational CII achieved against a determined required annual operational CII. Additionally, MEPC 75 proposed draft amendments requiring that, on or before January 1, 2023, all ships above 400 gross tonnage must have an approved SEEMP on board. For ships above 5,000 gross tonnage, the SEEMP would need to include certain mandatory content. The draft amendments introduced at MEPC 75 were adopted at the MEPC 76 session on June 2021 and have entered into force in November 2022, with the requirements for EEXI and CII certification coming into effect from January 1, 2023. MEPC 77 adopted a non-binding resolution which urges Member States and ship operators to voluntarily use distillate or other cleaner alternative fuels or methods of propulsion that are safe for ships and could contribute to the reduction of Black Carbon emissions from ships when operating in or near the Arctic. MEPC 79 adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, Appendix IX to include the attained and required CII values, the CII rating and attained EEXI for existing ships in the required information to be submitted to the IMO Ship Fuel Oil Consumption Database. The amendments will enter into force on May 1, 2024.\nWe may incur significant costs to comply with these revised standards, including the need to modify our vessels or engines to consume alternative fuels. Additional or new conventions, laws and regulations may be adopted that could require the installation of expensive emission control systems or engine power limitation (EPL) systems to reduce fuel use and carbon emissions, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \nSafety Management System Requirements\nThe SOLAS Convention was amended to address the safe manning of vessels and emergency training drills. The Convention of Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (the \u201cLLMC\u201d) sets limitations of liability for a loss of life or personal injury claim or a property claim against ship owners. We believe that our vessels are in substantial compliance with SOLAS and LLMC standards.\nUnder Chapter IX of the SOLAS Convention, or the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (the \u201cISM Code\u201d), our operations are also subject to environmental standards and requirements. The ISM Code requires the party with operational control of a vessel to develop an extensive safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. We rely upon the safety management system that we and our technical management team have developed \n11\n\n\nTable of Contents\nfor compliance with the ISM Code. The failure of a vessel owner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject such party to increased liability, may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. \nThe ISM Code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate for each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a vessel\u2019s management with the ISM Code requirements for a safety management system. No vessel can obtain a safety management certificate unless its manager has been awarded a document of compliance, issued by each flag state, under the ISM Code. We have obtained applicable documents of compliance for our offices and safety management certificates for all of our vessels for which the certificates are required by the IMO. The documents of compliance and safety management certificates are renewed as required.\nAmendments to the SOLAS Convention Chapter VII apply to vessels transporting dangerous goods and require those vessels be in compliance with the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (\u201cIMDG Code\u201d). Effective January 1, 2018, the IMDG Code includes (1) updates to the provisions for radioactive material, reflecting the latest provisions from the International Atomic Energy Agency, (2) new marking, packing and classification requirements for dangerous goods and (3) new mandatory training requirements. Amendments which took effect on January 1, 2020 also reflect the latest material from the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, including (1) new provisions regarding IMO type 9 tank, (2) new abbreviations for segregation groups, and (3) special provisions for carriage of lithium batteries and of vehicles powered by flammable liquid or gas. Additional amendments, which came into force on June 1, 2022, include (1) addition of a definition of dosage rate, (2) additions to the list of high consequence dangerous goods, (3) new provisions for medical/clinical waste, (4) addition of various ISO standards for gas cylinders, (5) a new handling code, and (6) changes to stowage and segregation provisions.\nThe IMO has also adopted the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (\u201cSTCW\u201d). As of February 2017, all seafarers are required to meet the STCW standards and be in possession of a valid STCW certificate. Flag states that have ratified SOLAS and STCW generally employ the classification societies, which have incorporated SOLAS and STCW requirements into their class rules, to undertake surveys to confirm compliance.\nFurthermore, recent action by the IMO\u2019s Maritime Safety Committee and United States agencies indicates that cybersecurity regulations for the maritime industry are likely to be further developed in the near future in an attempt to combat cybersecurity threats By IMO resolution, administrations are encouraged to ensure that cyber-risk management systems are incorporated by ship-owners and managers by their first annual Document of Compliance audit after January 1, 2021. In February 2021, the U.S. Coast Guard published guidance on addressing cyber risks in a vessel\u2019s safety management system. This might cause companies to create additional procedures for monitoring cybersecurity, which could require additional expenses and/or capital expenditures. The impact of future regulations is hard to predict at this time.\nIn June 2022, SOLAS also set out new amendments that will take effect January 1, 2024, which include new requirements for: (1) the design for safe mooring operations, (2) the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (\u201cGMDSS\u201d), (3) watertight integrity, (4) watertight doors on cargo ships, (5) fault-isolation of fire detection systems, (6) life-saving appliances, and (7) safety of ships using LNG as fuel. These new requirements may impact the cost of our operations.\n\u200b\nPollution Control and Liability Requirements\nThe IMO has negotiated international conventions that impose liability for pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the signatories to such conventions. For example, the IMO adopted an International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships\u2019 Ballast Water and Sediments (the \u201cBWM Convention\u201d) in 2004. The BWM Convention entered into force on September 8, 2017. The BWM Convention requires ships to manage their ballast water to remove, render harmless, or avoid the uptake or discharge of new or invasive aquatic organisms and pathogens within ballast water and sediments. The BWM Convention\u2019s implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of \n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmandatory ballast water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits, and require all ships to carry a ballast water record book and an international ballast water management certificate.\nOn December 4, 2013, the IMO Assembly passed a resolution revising the application dates of the BWM Convention so that the dates are triggered by the entry into force date and not the dates originally in the BWM Convention. This, in effect, makes all vessels delivered before the entry into force date \u201cexisting vessels\u201d and allows for the installation of ballast water management systems on such vessels at the first International Oil Pollution Prevention (\u201cIOPP\u201d) renewal survey following entry into force of the convention. The MEPC adopted updated guidelines for approval of ballast water management systems (G8) at MEPC 70. At MEPC 71, the schedule regarding the BWM Convention\u2019s implementation dates was also discussed and amendments were introduced to extend the date existing vessels are subject to certain ballast water standards. Those changes were adopted at MEPC 72. Ships over 400 gross tons generally must comply with a \u201cD-1 standard,\u201d requiring the exchange of ballast water only in open seas and away from coastal waters. The \u201cD-2 standard\u201d specifies the maximum amount of viable organisms allowed to be discharged, and compliance dates vary depending on the IOPP renewal dates. Depending on the date of the IOPP renewal survey, existing vessels must comply with the D-2 standard on or after September 8, 2019. For most ships, compliance with the D-2 standard will involve installing on-board systems to treat ballast water and eliminate unwanted organisms. Ballast water management systems, which include systems that make use of chemical, biocides, organisms or biological mechanisms, or which alter the chemical or physical characteristics of the ballast water, must be approved in accordance with IMO Guidelines (Regulation D-3). As of October 13, 2019, MEPC 72\u2019s amendments to the BWM Convention took effect, making the Code for Approval of Ballast Water Management Systems, which governs assessment of ballast water management systems, mandatory rather than permissive, and formalized an implementation schedule for the D-2 standard. Under these amendments, all ships must meet the D-2 standard by September 8, 2024. Costs of compliance with these regulations may be substantial. Additionally, in November 2020, MEPC 75 adopted amendments to the BWM Convention which would require a commissioning test of the ballast water management system for the initial survey or when performing an additional survey for retrofits. This analysis will not apply to ships that already have an installed BWM system certified under the BWM Convention. These amendments have entered into force on June 1, 2022. In December 2022, MEPC 79 agreed that it should be permitted to use ballast tanks for temporary storage of treated sewage and grey water. MEPC 79 also established that ships are expected to return to D-2 compliance after experiencing challenging uptake water and bypassing a BWM system should only be used as a last resort. Guidance will be developed at MEPC 80 (in July 2023) to set out appropriate actions and uniform procedures to ensure compliance with the BWM Convention.\nOnce mid-ocean exchange ballast water treatment requirements become mandatory under the BWM Convention, the cost of compliance could increase for ocean carriers and may have a material effect on our operations. However, many countries already regulate the discharge of ballast water carried by vessels from country to country to prevent the introduction of invasive and harmful species via such discharges. The U.S., for example, requires vessels entering its waters from another country to conduct mid-ocean ballast exchange, or undertake some alternate measure, and to comply with certain reporting requirements. \nThe IMO adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969, as amended by different Protocols in 1976, 1984 and 1992, and amended in 2000 (\u201cthe CLC\u201d). Under the CLC and depending on whether the country in which the damage results is a party to the 1992 Protocol to the CLC, a vessel\u2019s registered owner may be strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to certain exceptions. The 1992 Protocol changed certain limits on liability expressed using the International Monetary Fund currency unit, the Special Drawing Rights. The limits on liability have since been amended so that the compensation limits on liability were raised. The right to limit liability is forfeited under the CLC where the spill is caused by the shipowner\u2019s actual fault and under the 1992 Protocol where the spill is caused by the shipowner\u2019s intentional or reckless act or omission where the shipowner knew pollution damage would probably result. The CLC requires ships over 2,000 tons covered by it to maintain insurance covering the liability of the owner in a sum equivalent to an owner\u2019s liability for a single incident. We have P&I for environmental incidents. P&I Clubs in the International Group issue the required Bunkers Convention \u201cBlue Cards\u201d to enable signatory states to issue certificates. All of our vessels are in possession of a CLC State issued certificate attesting that the required insurance coverage is in force.\n13\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Protocol Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Pollution by Substances other than Oil 1973 (the \u201cIntervention Protocol\u201d) applies if there is a casualty involving a ship carrying LNG or LPG. The Intervention Protocol grants coastal states the right to intervene to prevent, mitigate or eliminate the danger of \u2018substances other than oil\u2019, including LNG and LPG, after consulting with other states affected and independent IMO-approved experts. The cost of such measures can usually be recovered by the governmental authority against the shipowner under national law.\nShips are required to maintain a certificate attesting that they maintain adequate insurance to cover an incident. In jurisdictions, such as the United States where the Bunker Convention has not been adopted, various legislative schemes or common law govern, and liability is imposed either on the basis of fault or on a strict-liability basis.\n\u200b\nAnti-Fouling Requirements\nIn 2001, the IMO adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships, or the \u201cAnti-fouling Convention.\u201d The Anti-fouling Convention, which entered into force on September 17, 2008, prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of mollusks and other sea life to the hulls of vessels. Vessels of over 400 gross tons engaged in international voyages will also be required to undergo an initial survey before the vessel is put into service or before an International Anti-fouling System Certificate, or the \u201cIAFS Certificate,\u201d is issued for the first time; and subsequent surveys when the anti-fouling systems are altered or replaced. Vessels of 24 meters in length or more but less than 400 gross tonnage engaged in international voyages will have to carry a Declaration on Anti-fouling Systems signed by the owner or authorized agent.\n\u200b\nIn November 2020, MEPC 75 approved draft amendments to the Anti-fouling Convention to prohibit anti-fouling systems containing cybutryne, which would apply to ships from January 1, 2023, or, for ships already bearing such an anti-fouling system, at the next scheduled renewal of the system after that date, but no later than 60 months following the last application to the ship of such a system. In addition, the IAFS Certificate has been updated to address compliance options for anti-fouling systems to address cybutryne. Ships which are affected by this ban on cybutryne must receive an updated IAFS Certificate no later than two years after the entry into force of these amendments. Ships which are not affected (i.e. with anti-fouling systems which do not contain cybutryne) must receive an updated IAFS Certificate at the next Anti-fouling application to the vessel. These amendments were formally adopted at MEPC 76 in June 2021.\n\u200b\nWe have obtained Anti-fouling System Certificates for all of our VLGCs that are subject to the Anti-fouling Convention.\nCompliance Enforcement\nNoncompliance with the ISM Code or other IMO regulations may subject the ship owner or bareboat charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. The USCG and European Union authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code by applicable deadlines will be prohibited from trading in U.S. and European Union ports, respectively. As of the date of this report, each of our vessels is ISM Code certified. However, there can be no assurance that such certificates will be maintained in the future. The IMO continues to review and introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and what effect, if any, such regulations might have on our operations.\nHazardous Substances\nIn 1996, the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damages in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea, or HNS, was adopted and subsequently amended by the 2010 Protocol, or the 2010 HNS Convention. Our LPG vessels may also become subject to the HNS Convention if it is entered into force. The Convention creates a regime of liability and compensation for damage from hazardous and noxious substances, including liquefied gases. The 2010 HNS Convention sets up a two-tier system of compensation composed of compulsory insurance taken out by shipowners and an HNS Fund which comes into play when the insurance is insufficient to satisfy a claim or does not cover the incident. Under the 2010 HNS Convention, if damage is caused by bulk HNS, \n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\nclaims for compensation will first be sought from the shipowner up to a maximum of 100 million SDR. If the damage is caused by packaged HNS or by both bulk and packaged HNS, the maximum liability is 115 million SDR. Once the limit is reached, compensation will be paid from the HNS Fund up to a maximum of 250 million SDR. The 2010 HNS Convention has not been ratified by a sufficient number of countries to enter into force, and we cannot estimate the costs that may be needed to comply with any such requirements that may be adopted with any certainty at this time.\nIn 2012, MEPC adopted a resolution amending the International Code for the Construction of Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk, or the IBC Code. The provisions of the IBC Code are mandatory under MARPOL and the SOLAS Convention. These amendments, which entered into force in June 2014 and took effect on January 1, 2021, pertain to revised international certificates of fitness for the carriage of dangerous chemicals in bulk and identifying new products that fall under the IBC Code. In May 2014, additional amendments to the IBC Code were adopted that became effective in January 2016. These amendments pertain to the installation of stability instruments and cargo tank purging. Our ECO VLGCs and Dual-fuel ECO VLGC are equipped with stability instruments and cargo tank purging. We may need to make certain minor financial expenditures to comply with these amendments for our modern 82,000 cbm VLGC. \nUnited States Regulations\nThe U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act\nThe U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (\u201cOPA\u201d) established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills. OPA affects all \u201cowners and operators\u201d whose vessels trade or operate within the U.S., its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in U.S. waters, which includes the U.S.\u2019s territorial sea and its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the U.S. The U.S. has also enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), which applies to the discharge of hazardous substances other than oil, except in limited circumstances, whether on land or at sea. OPA and CERCLA both define \u201cowner and operator\u201d in the case of a vessel as any person owning, operating or chartering by demise, the vessel. Both OPA and CERCLA impact our operations.\nUnder OPA, vessel owners and operators are \u201cresponsible parties\u201d and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels, including bunkers (fuel). OPA defines these other damages broadly to include:\n(i)\ninjury to, destruction or loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources and related assessment costs;\n\u200b\n(ii)\ninjury to, or economic losses resulting from, the destruction of real and personal property;\n\u200b\n(iii)\nloss of subsistence use of natural resources that are injured, destroyed or lost;\n\u200b\n(iv)\nnet loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees or net profit revenues resulting from injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property, or natural resources;\n\u200b\n(v)\nlost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources; and\n\u200b\n(vi)\nnet cost of increased or additional public services necessitated by removal activities following a discharge of oil, such as protection from fire, safety or health hazards, and loss of subsistence use of natural resources.\nOPA contains statutory caps on liability and damages; such caps do not apply to direct cleanup costs. Effective November 12, 2019, the USCG adjusted the limits of OPA liability for a tank vessel, other than a single-hull tank vessel, over 3,000 gross tons liability to the greater of $2,300 per gross ton or $19,943,400 (subject to periodic adjustment for \n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\ninflation). On December 23, 2022, the USCG issued a final rule to adjust the limitation of liability under the OPA. Effective March 23, 2023, the new adjusted limits of OPA liability for a tank vessel, other than a single-hull tank vessel, over 3,000 gross tons liability to the greater of $2,500 per gross ton or $21,521,300) (subject to periodic adjustment for inflation). These limits of liability do not apply if an incident was proximately caused by the violation of an applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulation by a responsible party (or its agent, employee or a person acting pursuant to a contractual relationship) or a responsible party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The limitation on liability similarly does not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to (i) report the incident as required by law where the responsible party knows or has reason to know of the incident; (ii) reasonably cooperate and assist as requested in connection with oil removal activities; or (iii) without sufficient cause, comply with an order issued under the Federal Water Pollution Act (Section 311 (c), (e)) or the Intervention on the High Seas Act.\nCERCLA contains a similar liability regime whereby owners and operators of vessels are liable for cleanup, removal and remedial costs, as well as damages for injury to, or destruction or loss of, natural resources, including the reasonable costs associated with assessing the same, and health assessments or health effects studies. There is no liability if the discharge of a hazardous substance results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war. Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5.0 million for vessels carrying a hazardous substance as cargo and the greater of $300 per gross ton or $500,000 for any other vessel. These limits do not apply (rendering the responsible person liable for the total cost of response and damages) if the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance resulted from willful misconduct or negligence, or the primary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety, construction or operating standards or regulations. The limitation on liability also does not apply if the responsible person fails or refuses to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance as requested in connection with response activities where the vessel is subject to OPA.\nOPA and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law, including maritime tort law. OPA and CERCLA both require owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which the particular responsible person may be subject. Vessel owners and operators may satisfy their financial responsibility obligations by providing proof of insurance, a surety bond, qualification as a self-insurer or a guarantee. We comply and plan to comply going forward with the USCG\u2019s financial responsibility regulations by providing applicable certificates of financial responsibility.\nThe 2010 \nDeepwater Horizon\n oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in additional regulatory initiatives or statutes, including higher liability caps under OPA, new regulations regarding offshore oil and gas drilling and a pilot inspection program for offshore facilities. However, several of these initiatives and regulations have been or may be revised. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement\u2019s (\u201cBSEE\u201d) revised Production Safety Systems Rule (\u201cPSSR\u201d), effective December 27, 2018, modified and relaxed certain environmental and safety protections under the 2016 PSSR. Additionally, the BSEE amended the Well Control Rule, effective July 15, 2019, which rolled back certain reforms regarding the safety of drilling operations, and former U.S. President Trump had proposed leasing new sections of U.S. waters to oil and gas companies for offshore drilling. In January 2021, current U.S. President Biden signed an executive order temporarily blocking new leases for oil and gas drilling in federal waters. However, attorney generals from 13 states filed suit in March 2021 to lift the executive order, and in June 2021, a federal judge in Louisiana granted a preliminary injunction against the Biden administration, stating that the power to pause offshore oil and gas leases \u201clies solely with Congress.\u201d In August 2022, a federal judge in Louisiana sided with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, along with the other 12 plaintiff states, by issuing a permanent injunction against the Biden Administration\u2019s moratorium on oil and gas leasing on federal public lands and offshore waters. With these rapid changes, compliance with any new requirements of OPA and future legislation or regulations applicable to the operation of our vessels could impact the cost of our operations and adversely affect our business.\nOPA specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, provided they accept, at a minimum, the levels of liability established under OPA and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills. Many U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law. Moreover, some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for discharge of \n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\npollutants within their waters, although in some cases, states which have enacted this type of legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations defining vessel owners\u2019 responsibilities under these laws. We intend to comply with all applicable state regulations in the ports where our vessels call.\nWe currently maintain pollution liability coverage insurance in the amount of $1.0 billion per incident for each of our vessels. If the damages from a catastrophic spill were to exceed our insurance coverage, it could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nOther United States Environmental Initiatives\nThe U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970 (including its amendments of 1977 and 1990) (\u201cCAA\u201d) requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. Our vessels are subject to vapor control and recovery requirements for certain cargoes when loading, unloading, ballasting, cleaning and conducting other operations in regulated port areas. The CAA also requires states to draft State Implementation Plans, or \u201cSIPs\u201d, designed to attain national health-based air quality standards in each state. Although state-specific, SIPs may include regulations concerning emissions resulting from vessel loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. Our vessels operating in such regulated port areas with restricted cargoes are equipped with vapor recovery systems that satisfy these existing requirements.\nThe U.S. Clean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d) prohibits the discharge of oil, hazardous substances and ballast water in U.S. navigable waters unless authorized by a duly-issued permit or exemption, and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA. In 2015, the EPA expanded the definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d (\u201cWOTUS\u201d), thereby expanding federal authority under the CWA. Following litigation on the revised WOTUS rule, in December 2018, the EPA and Department of the Army proposed a revised, limited definition of WOTUS. In 2019 and 2020, the agencies repealed the prior WOTUS rule and promulgated the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (\u201cNWPR\u201d), which significantly reduced the scope and oversight of EPA and the Department of the Army in traditionally non-navigable waterways. On August 30, 2021, a federal district court in Arizona vacated the NWPR and directed the agencies to replace the rule. On December 7, 2021, the EPA and Department of the Army proposed a rule that would reinstate the pre-2015 definition. On December 30, 2022, the EPA and the Department of Army announced the final WOTUS rule that largely reinstated the pre-2015 definition.\nThe EPA and the USCG have also enacted rules relating to ballast water discharge, compliance with which requires the installation of equipment on our vessels to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures at potentially substantial costs, and/or otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. Waters. The EPA will regulate these ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain vessels within United States waters pursuant to the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (\u201cVIDA\u201d), which was signed into law on December 4, 2018 and replaced the 2013 Vessel General Permit (\u201cVGP\u201d) program (which authorizes discharges incidental to operations of commercial vessels and contains numeric ballast water discharge limits for most vessels to reduce the risk of invasive species in U.S. waters, stringent requirements for scrubbers, and requirements for the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants) and current Coast Guard ballast water management regulations adopted under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act (\u201cNISA\u201d), such as mid-ocean ballast exchange programs and installation of approved USCG technology for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks bound for U.S. ports or entering U.S. waters. VIDA establishes a new framework for the regulation of vessel incidental discharges under Clean Water Act (CWA), requires the EPA to develop performance standards for those discharges within two years of enactment, and requires the U.S. Coast Guard to develop implementation, compliance and enforcement regulations within two years of EPA\u2019s promulgation of standards. Under VIDA, all provisions of the 2013 VGP and USCG regulations regarding ballast water treatment remain in force and effect until the EPA and U.S. Coast Guard regulations are finalized. Non-military, non-recreational vessels greater than 79 feet in length must continue to comply with the requirements of the VGP, including submission of a Notice of Intent (\u201cNOI\u201d) or retention of a PARI form and submission of annual reports. We have submitted NOIs for our vessels where required. Compliance with the EPA, U.S. Coast Guard and state regulations could require the installation of ballast water treatment equipment on our vessels or the implementation of other port facility disposal procedures at potentially substantial cost, or may otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. waters.\n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\nEuropean Union Regulations\nIn October 2009, the European Union amended a directive to impose criminal sanctions for illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances, including minor discharges, if committed with intent, recklessly or with serious negligence and the discharges individually or in the aggregate result in deterioration of the quality of water. Aiding and abetting the discharge of a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties. The directive applies to all types of vessels, irrespective of their flag, but certain exceptions apply to warships or where human safety or that of the ship is in danger. Criminal liability for pollution may result in substantial penalties or fines and increased civil liability claims. Regulation (EU) 2015/757 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 (amending EU Directive 2009/16/EC) governs the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport, and, subject to some exclusions, requires companies with ships over 5,000 gross tonnage to monitor and report carbon dioxide emissions annually, which may cause us to incur additional expenses.\nThe European Union has adopted several regulations and directives requiring, among other things, more frequent inspections of high-risk ships, as determined by type, age, and flag as well as the number of times the ship has been detained. The European Union also adopted and extended a ban on substandard ships and enacted a minimum ban period and a definitive ban for repeated offenses. The regulation also provided the European Union with greater authority and control over classification societies, by imposing more requirements on classification societies and providing for fines or penalty payments for organizations that failed to comply. Furthermore, the EU has implemented regulations requiring vessels to use reduced sulfur content fuel for their main and auxiliary engines. The EU Directive 2005/33/EC (amending Directive 1999/32/EC) introduced requirements parallel to those in Annex VI relating to the sulfur content of marine fuels. In addition, the EU imposed a 0.1% maximum sulfur requirement for fuel used by ships at berth in the Baltic, the North Sea and the English Channel (the so called \u201cSOx-Emission Control Area\u201d). As of January 2020, EU member states must also ensure that ships in all EU waters, except the SOx-Emission Control Area, use fuels with a 0.5% maximum sulfur content. \nOn September 15, 2020, the European Parliament voted to include greenhouse gas emissions from the maritime sector in the European Union\u2019s carbon market, the EU Emissions Trading System (\u201cEU ETS\u201d). The Environment Council adopted a general approach on the proposal in June 2022. On December 18, 2022, the Environmental Council and \u00a0European Parliament agreed to include maritime shipping emissions within the scope of the EU ETS on a gradual introduction of obligations for shipping companies to surrender allowances: 40% for verified emissions from 2024, 70% for 2025 and 100% for 2026. Most large vessels will be included in the scope of the EU ETS from the start. Big offshore vessels of 5,000 gross tonnage and above will be included in the 'MRV' on the monitoring, reporting and verification of CO2 emissions from maritime transport regulation from 2025 and in the EU ETS from 2027. General cargo vessels and off-shore vessels between 400-5,000 gross tonnage will be included in the MRV regulation from 2025 and their inclusion in EU ETS will be reviewed in 2026.\nInternational Labour Organization\nThe International Labour Organization (the \u201cILO\u201d) is a specialized agency of the UN that has adopted the Maritime Labor Convention 2006 (\u201cMLC 2006\u201d). A Maritime Labor Certificate and a Declaration of Maritime Labor Compliance is required to ensure compliance with the MLC 2006 for all ships that are 500 gross tonnage or over and are either engaged in international voyages or flying the flag of a member and operating from a port, or between ports, in another country. We believe that all our vessels are in substantial compliance with and are certified to meet MLC 2006.\nGreenhouse Gas Regulation\nCurrently, the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which entered into force in 2005 and pursuant to which adopting countries have been required to implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with targets extended through 2020. International negotiations are continuing with respect to a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, and restrictions on shipping emissions may be included in any new treaty. In December 2009, more than 27 nations, including the U.S. and China, signed the Copenhagen Accord, which includes a non-binding commitment to reduce greenhouse gas \n18\n\n\nTable of Contents\nemissions. The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris resulted in the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on November 4, 2016 and does not directly limit greenhouse gas emissions from ships. The U.S. initially entered into the agreement, but on June 1, 2017, former U.S. President Trump announced that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and the withdrawal became effective on November 4, 2020. On January 20, 2021, U.S. President Biden signed an executive order to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which the U.S. officially rejoined on February 19, 2021. On April 22, 2021, U.S. President Biden also announced a new target for the U.S. to achieve a 50-52% reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net greenhouse pollution by 2030.\nAt MEPC 70 and MEPC 71, a draft outline of the structure of the initial strategy for developing a comprehensive IMO strategy on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships was approved. In accordance with this roadmap, in April 2018, nations at the MEPC 72 adopted an initial strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. The initial strategy identifies \u201clevels of ambition\u201d to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including (1) decreasing the carbon intensity from ships through implementation of further phases of the EEDI for new ships; (2) reducing carbon dioxide emissions per transport work, as an average across international shipping, by at least 40% by 2030, pursuing efforts towards 70% by 2050, compared to 2008 emission levels; and (3) reducing the total annual greenhouse emissions by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 while pursuing efforts towards phasing them out entirely. The initial strategy notes that technological innovation, alternative fuels and/or energy sources for international shipping will be integral to achieve the overall ambition. These regulations could cause us to incur additional substantial expenses. At MEPC 77, the Member States agreed to initiate the revision of the Initial IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG emissions from ships, recognizing the need to strengthen the ambition during the revision process. MEPC 79 revised the EEDI calculation guidelines to include a CO2 conversion factor for ethane, a reference to the updated ITCC guidelines, and a clarification that in case of a ship with multiple load line certificates, the maximum certified summer draft should be used when determining the deadweight. A final draft Revised IMO GHG Strategy would be considered by MEPC 80 (scheduled to meet in July 2023), with a view to adoption.\nThe EU made a unilateral commitment to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions from its member states from 20% of 1990 levels by 2020. The EU also committed to reduce its emissions by 20% under the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s second period from 2013 to 2020. Starting in January 2018, large ships over 5,000 gross tonnage calling at EU ports are required to collect and publish data on carbon dioxide emissions and other information. As previously discussed, regulations relating to the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from the maritime sector in the European Union\u2019s carbon market, EU ETS, are also forthcoming.\nIn the United States, the EPA issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and safety, adopted regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain mobile sources and proposed regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from large stationary sources. However, in March 2017, former U.S. President Trump signed an executive order to review and possibly eliminate the EPA\u2019s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and in August 2019, the Administration announced plans to weaken regulations for methane emissions. On August 13, 2020, the EPA released rules rolling back standards to control methane and volatile organic compound emissions from new oil and gas facilities. However, U.S. President Biden directed the EPA to publish a proposed rule suspending, revising, or rescinding certain of these rules. On November 2, 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule under the CAA designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas sources. The proposed rule would reduce 41 million tons of methane emissions between 2023 and 2035 and cut methane emissions in the oil and gas sector by approximately 74 percent compared to emissions from this sector in 2005. EPA also issued a supplemental proposed rule in November 2022 to include additional methane reduction measures following public input and anticipates issuing a final rule in 2023. If these new regulations are finalized, they could affect our operations.\nAny passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, the EU, the U.S. or other countries where we operate, or any treaty adopted at the international level to succeed the Kyoto Protocol or Paris Agreement, that restricts emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant financial expenditures which we cannot predict with certainty at this time. As of March 31, 2023, thirteen of our ECO-VLGCs, including one of our chartered-in ECO-VLGCs, are equipped with scrubbers and we have contractual commitments related to scrubbers on an additional three VLGCs as of March 31, 2023. In addition to the added costs, the concern over climate change and \n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nregulatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may reduce global demand for oil and oil products, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and cash flows. \nEven in the absence of climate control legislation, our business may be indirectly affected to the extent that climate change may result in sea level changes or certain weather events. In addition, there may be significant physical effects of climate change from greenhouse gas emissions that have the potential to negatively impact our customers, personnel, and physical assets any of which could adversely impact the demand for our services or our ability to recruit personnel.\nVessel Security Regulations\nSince the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security such as the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (\u201cMTSA\u201d). To implement certain portions of the MTSA, the USCG issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and at certain ports and facilities, some of which are regulated by the EPA.\nSimilarly, Chapter XI-2 of the SOLAS Convention imposes detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities and mandates compliance with the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (\u201cthe ISPS Code\u201d). The ISPS Code is designed to enhance the security of ports and ships against terrorism. To trade internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate (\u201cISSC\u201d) from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel\u2019s flag state. Ships operating without a valid certificate may be detained, expelled from, or refused entry at port until they obtain an ISSC. The various requirements, some of which are found in the SOLAS Convention, include, for example, on-board installation of automatic identification systems to provide a means for the automatic transmission of safety-related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations, including information on a ship\u2019s identity, position, course, speed and navigational status; on-board installation of ship security alert systems, which do not sound on the vessel but only alert the authorities on shore; the development of vessel security plans; ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel\u2019s hull; a continuous synopsis record kept onboard showing a vessel's history including the name of the ship, the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, the date on which the ship was registered with that state, the ship's identification number, the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owner(s) and their registered address; and compliance with flag state security certification requirements\nThe USCG regulations, intended to align with international maritime security standards, exempt non-U.S. vessels from MTSA vessel security measures, provided such vessels have on board a valid ISSC that attests to the vessel\u2019s compliance with the SOLAS Convention security requirements and the ISPS Code. Future security measures could have a significant financial impact on us. We intend to comply with the various security measures addressed by MTSA, the SOLAS Convention and the ISPS Code.\nThe cost of vessel security measures has also been affected by the escalation in the frequency of acts of piracy against ships, notably off the coast of Somalia, including the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea area. In addition, certain state actors in the Arabian Gulf have recently seized ships for alleged violations of law, though the veracity of such claims has been doubted. Substantial loss of revenue and other costs may be incurred as a result of detention of a vessel or additional security measures, and the risk of uninsured losses could significantly affect our business. Costs are incurred in taking additional security measures in accordance with Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy, notably those contained in the BMP5 industry standard.\n\u200b\nWe seek to manage exposure to losses from the above-described environmental and vessel security laws through our development of appropriate risk management programs, including compliance programs, safety management systems and insurance programs, as applicable.\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTaxation \n\u200b\nThe following is a discussion of the material Marshall Islands and United States federal income tax considerations relevant to a United States Holder and a Non-United States Holder, each as defined below, with respect to the common shares. This discussion does not purport to deal with the tax consequences of owning our common shares to all categories of investors, some of which, such as financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, tax exempt organizations, insurance companies, persons holding our common stock as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle, traders in securities that have elected the mark to market method of accounting for their securities, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons subject to the \u201cbase erosion and anti-avoidance\u201d tax, persons who are investors in partnerships or other pass through entities for United States federal income tax purposes or hold our common shares through an applicable partnership interest, dealers in securities or currencies, United States Holders whose functional currency is not the United States dollar, investor that are required to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes no later than when such income is included on an \u201capplicable financial statement\u201d and investors that own, actually or under applicable constructive ownership rules, 10% or more of our shares of common stock, may be subject to special rules. This discussion deals only with holders who purchase and hold the common shares as a capital asset. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisors concerning the overall tax consequences arising in your own particular situation under United States federal, state, local or non-United States law of the ownership of common shares.\n\u200b\nMarshall Islands Tax Considerations\n\u200b\nIn the opinion of Seward & Kissel LLP, the following are the material Marshall Islands tax consequences of our activities to us and of our common shares to our shareholders. We are incorporated in the Marshall Islands. Under current Marshall Islands law, we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains, and no Marshall Islands withholding tax will be imposed upon payments of dividends by us to our shareholders.\n\u200b\nUnited States Federal Income Tax Considerations\n\u200b\nIn the opinion of Seward & Kissel LLP, the following are the material United States federal income tax consequences to us of our activities and to United States Holders and Non-United States Holders, each as defined below, of the common shares. The following discussion of United States federal income tax matters is based on the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as in effect as of the date hereof, or the Code, judicial decisions, administrative pronouncements, and existing and proposed regulations issued by the United States Department of the Treasury, or the Treasury Regulations, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. The discussion below is based, in part, on the description of our business as described in this report and assumes that we conduct our business as described herein. \n\u200b\nUnited States Federal Income Taxation of Operating Income: In General \n\u200b\nUnless we qualify for an exemption from United States federal income taxation under the rules of Section 883 of the Code, or Section 883, as discussed below, a foreign corporation such as the Company will be subject to United States federal income taxation on its \u201cshipping income\u201d that is treated as derived from sources within the United States, to which we refer as \u201cUnited States source shipping income.\u201d For United States federal income tax purposes, \"United States source shipping income\" includes 50% of shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States.\n\u200b\nShipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between non-United States ports will be considered to be 100% derived from sources entirely outside the United States. Shipping income derived from sources outside the United States will not be subject to any United States federal income tax.\n\u200b\nShipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between United States ports is considered to be 100% derived from United States sources. However, we are not permitted by United States law to engage in the transportation of cargoes that produces 100% United States source shipping income.\n\u200b\n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\nUnless we qualify for the exemption from tax under Section 883, our gross United States source shipping income would be subject to a 4% tax imposed without allowance for deductions as described below.\n\u200b\nExemption of Operating Income from United States Federal Income Taxation\n\u200b\nUnder Section 883 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, a foreign corporation will be exempt from United States federal income taxation of its United States source shipping income if:\n\u200b\n1)\nit is organized in a \u201cqualified foreign country\u201d which is one that grants an \"equivalent exemption\" from tax to corporations organized in the United States in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under Section 883; and\n\u200b\n2)\none of the following tests is met:\n\u200b\nA)\nmore than 50% of the value of its shares is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by \u201cqualified shareholders,\u201d which as defined includes individuals who are \u201cresidents\u201d of a qualified foreign country, to which we refer as the \u201c50% Ownership Test\u201d; or\n\u200b\nB)\nits shares are \u201cprimarily and regularly traded on an established securities market\u201d in a qualified foreign country or in the United States, to which we refer as the \u201cPublicly-Traded Test.\u201d\n\u200b\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands, the jurisdiction where we and our ship\n-\nowning subsidiaries are incorporated, has been officially recognized by the United States Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, as a qualified foreign country that grants the requisite \u201cequivalent exemption\u201d from tax in respect of each category of shipping income we earn and currently expect to earn in the future. Therefore, we will be exempt from United States federal income taxation with respect to our United States source shipping income if we satisfy either the 50% Ownership Test or the Publicly-Traded Test.\n\u200b\nWe believe that we satisfy the Publicly-Traded Test, a factual determination made on an annual basis, with respect to our taxable year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023, and we expect to continue to do so for our subsequent taxable years, and we intend to take this position for United States federal income tax reporting purposes. We do not currently anticipate circumstances under which we would be able to satisfy the 50% Ownership Test.\n\u200b\nPublicly-Traded Test\n\u200b\nThe Treasury Regulations under Section 883 provide, in pertinent part, that shares of a foreign corporation will be considered to be \u201cprimarily traded\u201d on an established securities market in a country if the number of shares of each class of stock that are traded during any taxable year on all established securities markets in that country exceeds the number of shares in each such class that are traded during that year on established securities markets in any other single country. The Company\u2019s common shares, which constitute its sole class of issued and outstanding stock is \u201cprimarily traded\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, an established securities market for these purposes.\n\u200b\nUnder the Treasury Regulations, our common shares will be considered to be \u201cregularly traded\u201d on an established securities market if one or more classes of our shares representing more than 50% of our outstanding stock, by both total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and total value, are listed on such market, to which we refer as the \u201clisting threshold.\u201d Since all of our common shares are listed on the NYSE, we expect to satisfy the listing threshold.\n\u200b\nThe Treasury Regulations also require that with respect to each class of stock relied upon to meet the listing threshold, (i) such class of stock traded on the market, other than in minimal quantities, on at least 60 days during the taxable year or one-sixth of the days in a short taxable year, which we refer to as the \u201ctrading frequency test\u201d; and (ii) the aggregate number of shares of such class of stock traded on such market during the taxable year must be at least 10% of the average number of shares of such class of stock outstanding during such year or as appropriately adjusted in the case of a short taxable year, which we refer to as the \u201ctrading volume\u201d test. We anticipate that we will satisfy the trading frequency and trading volume tests. Even if this were not the case, the Treasury Regulations provide that the trading \n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\nfrequency and trading volume tests will be deemed satisfied if, as is expected to be the case with our common shares, such class of stock is traded on an established securities market in the United States and such shares are regularly quoted by dealers making a market in such shares.\n\u200b\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Treasury Regulations provide, in pertinent part, that a class of shares will not be considered to be \u201cregularly traded\u201d on an established securities market for any taxable year in which 50% or more of the vote and value of the outstanding shares of such class are owned on more than half the days during the taxable year by persons who each own 5% or more of the vote and value of such class of outstanding stock, to which we refer as the \"5% Override Rule.\"\n\u200b\nFor purposes of being able to determine the persons who actually or constructively own 5% or more of the vote and value of our common shares, or \u201c5% Shareholders,\u201d the Treasury Regulations permit us to rely on those persons that are identified on Schedule 13G and Schedule 13D filings with the Commission, as owning 5% or more of our common shares. The Treasury Regulations further provide that an investment company which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, will not be treated as a 5% Shareholder for such purposes.\n\u200b\nIn the event the 5% Override Rule is triggered, the Treasury Regulations provide that the 5% Override Rule will nevertheless not apply if we can establish that within the group of 5% Shareholders, qualified shareholders (as defined for purposes of Section 883) own sufficient number of shares to preclude non-qualified shareholders in such group from owning 50% or more of our common shares for more than half the number of days during the taxable year.\n\u200b\nWe believe that we\u00a0satisfy the Publicly-Traded Test and will not be subject to the 5% Override Rule for taxable year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023 and we also expect to continue to do so for our subsequent taxable years. However, there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause us to lose the benefit of the Section 883 exemption. For example, we may no longer qualify for Section 883 exemption for a particular taxable year if 5% Shareholders were to own, in the aggregate, 50% or more of our outstanding common shares on more than half the days of the taxable year, unless we could establish that within the group of 5% Shareholders, qualified shareholders own sufficient number of our shares to preclude the non-qualified shareholders in such group from owning 50% or more of our common shares for more than half the number of days during the taxable year. Under the Treasury Regulations, we would have to satisfy certain substantiation requirements regarding the identity of our shareholders. These requirements are onerous and there is no assurance that we would be able to satisfy them. Given the factual nature of the issues involved, we can give no assurances in regards of our or our subsidiaries' qualification for the Section 883 exemption.\n\u200b\nTaxation in Absence of Section 883 Exemption\n\u200b\nIf the benefits of Section 883 are unavailable, our United States source shipping income would be subject to a 4% tax imposed by Section 887 of the Code on a gross basis, without the benefit of deductions, or the \u201c4% gross basis tax regime,\u201d to the extent that such income is not considered to be \u201ceffectively connected\u201d with the conduct of a United States trade or business, as described below. Since under the sourcing rules described above, no more than 50% of our shipping income would be treated as being United States source shipping income, the maximum effective rate of United States federal income tax on our shipping income would never exceed 2% under the 4% gross basis tax regime.\n\u200b\nTo the extent our United States source shipping income is considered to be \u201ceffectively connected\u201d with the conduct of a United States trade or business, as described below, any such \"effectively connected\" United States source shipping income, net of applicable deductions, would be subject to United States federal income tax, currently imposed at a rate of 21%. In addition, we would generally be subject to the 30% \"branch profits\" tax on earnings effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business, as determined after allowance for certain adjustments, and on certain interest paid or deemed paid attributable to the conduct of our United States trade or business.\n\u200b\nOur United States source shipping income would be considered \u201ceffectively connected\u201d with the conduct of a United States trade or business only if:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nwe have, or are considered to have, a fixed place of business in the United States involved in the earning of United States source shipping income; and\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nsubstantially all of our United States source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the United States.\n\u200b\nWe do not intend to have, or permit circumstances that would result in having, any vessel sailing to or from the United States on a regularly scheduled basis. Based on the foregoing and on the expected mode of our shipping operations and other activities, it is anticipated that none of our United States source shipping income will be \u201ceffectively connected\u201d with the conduct of a United States trade or business.\n\u200b\nUnited States Taxation of Gain on Sale of Vessels\n\u200b\nRegardless of whether we qualify for exemption under Section 883, we will not be subject to United States federal income tax with respect to gain realized on a sale of a vessel, provided the sale is considered to occur outside of the United States under United States federal income tax principles. In general, a sale of a vessel will be considered to occur outside of the United States for this purpose if title to the vessel, and risk of loss with respect to the vessel, pass to the buyer outside of the United States. It is expected that any sale of a vessel by us will be considered to occur outside of the United States.\n\u200b\nUnited States Federal Income Taxation of United States Holders\n\u200b\nAs used herein, the term \u201cUnited States Holder\u201d means a holder that for United States federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of common shares and is an individual United States citizen or resident, a United States corporation or other United States entity taxable as a corporation, an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.\n\u200b\nIf a partnership holds the common shares, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding the common shares, you are encouraged to consult your tax advisor.\n\u200b\nDistributions\n\u200b\nSubject to the discussion of passive foreign investment companies below, any distributions made by us with respect to our common shares to a United States Holder will generally constitute dividends to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of such earnings and profits will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the United States Holder\u2019s tax basis in its common shares and thereafter as capital gain. Because we are not a United States corporation, United States Holders that are corporations will generally not be entitled to claim a dividends-received deduction with respect to any distributions they receive from us. Dividends paid with respect to our common shares will generally be treated as foreign source dividend income and will generally constitute \u201cpassive category income\u201d for purposes of computing allowable foreign tax credits for United States foreign tax credit purposes.\n\u200b\nDividends paid on our common shares to certain non\n-\ncorporate United States Holders will generally be treated as \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d that is taxable to such United States Holders at preferential tax rates provided that (1) the common shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States (such as the NYSE, on which our common shares will be traded), (2) the shareholder has owned the common stock for more than 60 days in the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the date on which the common stock becomes ex-dividend, and (3) we are not a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately preceding taxable year.\n\u200b\nThere is no assurance that any dividends paid on our common shares will be eligible for these preferential rates in the hands of such non-corporate United States Holders, although, as described above, we expect such dividends to be so eligible provided an eligible non-corporate United States Holder meets all applicable requirements and we are not a \n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\npassive foreign passive investment company in the taxable year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately preceding taxable year. Any dividends paid by us which are not eligible for these preferential rates will be taxed as ordinary income to a non-corporate United States Holder.\n\u200b\nSpecial rules may apply to any \u201cextraordinary dividend\u201d\u2014generally, a dividend in an amount which is equal to or in excess of 10% of a shareholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis or dividends received within a one-year period that, in the aggregate, equal or exceed 20% of a shareholder's adjusted tax basis (or fair market value upon the shareholder's election) in a common share\u2014paid by us. If we pay an \u201cextraordinary dividend\u201d on our common shares that is treated as \u201cqualified dividend income,\u201d then any loss derived by certain non-corporate United States Holders from the sale or exchange of such common shares will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of such dividend.\n\u200b\nSale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Shares\n\u200b\nAssuming we do not constitute a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year, a United States Holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by the United States Holder from such sale, exchange or other disposition and the United States Holder\u2019s tax basis in such shares. Such gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the United States Holder\u2019s holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale, exchange or other disposition. Such capital gain or loss will generally be treated as United States source income or loss, as applicable, for United States foreign tax credit purposes. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate United States Holders are currently eligible for reduced rates of taxation. A United States Holder\u2019s ability to deduct capital losses is subject to certain limitations.\n\u200b\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Status and Significant Tax Consequences\n\u200b\nSpecial United States federal income tax rules apply to a United States Holder that holds shares in a foreign corporation classified as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company,\u201d or a PFIC, for United States federal income tax purposes. In general, we will be treated as a PFIC with respect to a United States Holder if, for any taxable year in which such holder holds our common shares, either:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nat least 75% of our gross income for such taxable year consists of passive income (e.g., dividends, interest, capital gains and rents derived other than in the active conduct of a rental business); or\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nat least 50% of the average value of our assets during such taxable year produce, or are held for the production of, passive income.\n\u200b\nFor purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC, we will be treated as earning and owning our proportionate share of the income and assets, respectively, of any of our ship\n-\nowning subsidiaries in which we own at least 25% of the value of the subsidiary's stock. Income earned, or deemed earned, by us in connection with the performance of services would not constitute passive income. By contrast, rental income would generally constitute \"passive income\" unless we were treated under specific rules as deriving our rental income in the active conduct of a trade or business.\n\u200b\nWe believe that income we earn from the voyage charters, and also from time charters, for the reasons discussed below, will be treated as active income for PFIC purposes and as a result, we intend to take the position that we satisfy the 75% income test for our taxable year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023.\n\u200b\nBased on our current and anticipated operations, we do not believe that we will be treated as a PFIC for our taxable year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023 or subsequent taxable years, and we intend to take such position for our United States federal income tax reporting purposes. Our belief is based principally on the position that the gross income we derive from our voyage or time chartering activities should constitute services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, such income should not constitute passive income, and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of such income, in particular, the vessels, should not constitute passive assets for purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC. There is substantial legal authority supporting this position consisting of case law and IRS pronouncements concerning the characterization of income derived from time charters as services income for other tax purposes. However, \n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\nthere is also authority which characterizes time charter income as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the IRS or a court of law will accept this position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. In addition, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner to avoid being classified as a PFIC with respect to any taxable year, we cannot assure you that the nature of our operations will not change in the future.\n\u200b\nAs discussed more fully below, for any taxable year in which we are, or were to be treated as, a PFIC, a United States Holder would be subject to different taxation rules depending on whether the United States Holder makes an election to treat us as a \"Qualified Electing Fund,\" which election we refer to as a \u201cQEF election.\u201d As an alternative to making a QEF election, a United States Holder should be able to make a \u201cmark-to-market\u201d election with respect to our common shares, as discussed below. A United States holder of shares in a PFIC will be required to file an annual information return containing information regarding the PFIC as required by applicable Treasury Regulations. We intend to promptly notify our shareholders if we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year.\n\u200b\nTaxation of United States Holders Making a Timely QEF Election\n\u200b\nIf a United States Holder makes a timely QEF election, which United States Holder we refer to as an \u201cElecting Holder,\u201d the Electing Holder must report for United States federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of our ordinary earnings and net capital gain, if any, for each of our taxable years during which we are a PFIC that ends with or within the taxable year of the Electing Holder, regardless of whether distributions were received from us by the Electing Holder. No portion of any such inclusions of ordinary earnings will be treated as \u201cqualified dividend income.\u201d Net capital gain inclusions of certain non\n-\ncorporate United States Holders would be eligible for preferential capital gains tax rates. The Electing Holder's adjusted tax basis in the common shares will be increased to reflect any income included under the QEF election. Distributions of previously taxed income will not be subject to tax upon distribution but will decrease the Electing Holder's tax basis in the common shares. An Electing Holder would not, however, be entitled to a deduction for its pro rata share of any losses that we incur with respect to any taxable year. An Electing Holder would generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares. A United States Holder would make a timely QEF election for our common shares by filing one copy of IRS Form 8621 with his United States federal income tax return for the first year in which he held such shares when we were a PFIC. If we take the position that we are not a PFIC for any taxable year, and it is later determined that we were a PFIC for such taxable year, it may be possible for a United States Holder to make a retroactive QEF election effective for such year. If we determine that we are a PFIC for any taxable year, we will provide each United States Holder with all necessary information required for the United States Holder to make the QEF election and to report its pro rata share of our ordinary earnings and net capital gain, if any, for each of our taxable years during which we are a PFIC that ends with or within the taxable year of the Electing Holder as described above.\n\u200b\nTaxation of United States Holders Making a \"Mark-to-Market\" Election\n\u200b\nAlternatively, for any taxable year in which we determine that we are a PFIC, and, assuming as we anticipate will be the case, our shares are treated as \"marketable stock,\" a United States Holder would be allowed to make a \u201cmark-to-market\u201d election with respect to our common shares, provided the United States Holder completes and files IRS Form 8621 in accordance with the relevant instructions and related Treasury Regulations. If that election is made, the United States Holder generally would include as ordinary income in each taxable year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the common shares at the end of the taxable year over such Holder's adjusted tax basis in the common shares. The United States Holder would also be permitted an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the United States Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the common shares over its fair market value at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. A United States Holder's tax basis in his common shares would be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amount recognized. In a year when we are a PFIC, any gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the common shares would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent that such loss does not exceed the net mark-to-market gains previously included by the United States Holder.\n\u200b\n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTaxation of United States Holders Not Making a Timely QEF or Mark-to-Market Election\n\u200b\nFor any taxable year in which we determine that we are a PFIC, a United States Holder who does not make either a QEF election or a \u201cmark-to-market\u201d election for that year, whom we refer to as a \u201cNon\n-\nElecting Holder,\u201d would be subject to special rules with respect to (i) any excess distribution (i.e., the portion of any distributions received by the Non\n-\nElecting Holder on the common shares in a taxable year in excess of 125% of the average annual distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder in the three preceding taxable years, or, if shorter, the Non-Electing Holder\u2019s holding period for the common shares), and (ii) any gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares. Under these special rules:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over the Non-Electing Holder\u2019s aggregate holding period for the common shares;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe amount allocated to the current taxable year, and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which we were a PFIC, would be taxed as ordinary income and would not be \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d; and\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe amount allocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year, and an interest charge for the deemed tax deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such other taxable year.\n\u200b\nUnited States Federal Income Taxation of \u201cNon-United States Holders\u201d\n\u200b\nAs used herein, the term \u201cNon-United States Holder\u201d means a holder that, for United States federal income tax purposes, is a beneficial owner of common shares (other than a partnership) that is not a United States Holder.\n\u200b\nIf a partnership holds our common shares, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding our common shares, you are encouraged to consult your tax advisor.\n\u200b\nDividends on Common Shares\n\u200b\nSubject to the discussion of backup withholding below, a Non-United States Holder generally will not be subject to United States federal income or withholding tax on dividends received from us with respect to our common shares, unless:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe dividend income is effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business in the United States; or\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe Non-United States Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of receipt of the dividend income and other conditions are met.\n\u200b\nSale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Shares\n\u200b\nSubject to the discussion of backup withholding below, a Non-United States Holder generally will not be subject to United States federal income or withholding tax on any gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares, unless:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe gain is effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business in the United States; or\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe Non-United States Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of disposition and other conditions are met.\n\u200b\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIncome or Gains Effectively Connected with a United States Trade or Business\n\u200b\nIf the Non-United States Holder is engaged in a United States trade or business for United States federal income tax purposes, dividends on our common shares and gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares, that are effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment), will generally be subject to regular United States federal income tax in the same manner as discussed in the previous section relating to the taxation of United States Holders. In addition, in the case of a corporate Non-United States Holder, its earnings and profits that are attributable to the effectively connected income, which are subject to certain adjustments, may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or at a lower rate as may be specified by an applicable United States income tax treaty.\n\u200b\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\n\u200b\nIn general, dividend payments, or other taxable distributions, and the payment of the gross proceeds on a sale of our common shares, made within the United States to a non\n-\ncorporate United States Holder will be subject to information reporting. Such payments or distributions may also be subject to backup withholding if the non\n-\ncorporate United States Holder:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nfails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nis notified by the IRS that it has have failed to report all interest or dividends required to be shown on its federal income tax returns; or\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nin certain circumstances, fails to comply with applicable certification requirements.\n\u200b\nNon-United States Holders may be required to establish their exemption from information reporting and backup withholding with respect to dividends payments or other taxable distribution on our common shares by certifying their status on an appropriate IRS Form W-8. If a Non-United States Holder sells our common shares to or through a United States office of a broker, the payment of the proceeds is subject to both United States backup withholding and information reporting unless the Non-United States Holder certifies that it is a non-United States person, under penalties of perjury, or it otherwise establish an exemption. If a Non\n-\nUnited States Holder sells our common shares through a Non-United States office of a Non-United States broker and the sales proceeds are paid outside the United States, then information reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to that payment. However, United States information reporting requirements, but not backup withholding, will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if that payment is made outside the United States, if a Non-United States Holder sells our common shares through a Non-United States office of a broker that is a United States person or has some other contacts with the United States. Such information reporting requirements will not apply, however, if the broker has documentary evidence in its records that the Non-United States Holder is not a United States person and certain other conditions are met, or the Non-United States Holder otherwise establishes an exemption.\n\u200b\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, a refund may generally be obtained of any amounts withheld under backup withholding rules that exceed the taxpayer's United States federal income tax liability by filing a timely refund claim with the IRS.\n\u200b\nIndividuals who are United States Holders (and to the extent specified in applicable Treasury regulations, Non-United States Holders and certain United States entities) who hold \u201cspecified foreign financial assets\u201d (as defined in Section 6038D of the Code) are required to file IRS Form 8938 with information relating to the asset for each taxable year in which the aggregate value of all such assets exceeds $75,000 at any time during the taxable year or $50,000 on the last day of the taxable year (or such higher dollar amount as prescribed by applicable Treasury Regulations). Specified foreign financial assets would include, among other assets, our common shares, unless the common shares are held in an account maintained with a United States financial institution. Substantial penalties apply to any failure to timely file IRS Form 8938, unless the failure is shown to be due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. Additionally, in the event an individual United States Holder (and to the extent specified in applicable Treasury Regulations, a Non-United States Holder or a United States entity) that is required to file IRS Form 8938 does not file such form, the statute of limitations \n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\non the assessment and collection of United States federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not close until three years after the date that the required information is filed. United States Holders (including United States entities) and Non-United States Holders are encouraged consult their own tax advisors regarding their reporting obligations in respect of our common shares.\n\u200b\nAvailable Information\n\u200b\nOur website is located at www.dorianlpg.com.

Other risks relate principally to the securities markets and ownership of our common shares. Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay dividends, and lower the trading price of our common shares.\n\u200b\nSummary of Risk Factors\n\u200b\nThe following is a summary of the risk factors you should be aware of before making a decision to invest in our common stock. This summary does not address all the risks we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks we face, can be found below in this risk factor section and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Annual Report and other filings with the Commission, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\n\u200b\nRisks Relating to Our Company\n\u200b\n\u2022\nWe, and the Helios Pool, operate exclusively in the VLGC segment of the LPG shipping industry. Due to the general lack of industry diversification, adverse developments in the VLGC segment of the LPG shipping industry may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022\nSeasonal and other fluctuations in respect of spot market charter rates have had in the past and may have in the future a negative effect on our revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nWe and/or our pool managers may not be able to successfully secure employment for our vessels or vessels in the Helios Pool, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe face substantial competition in trying to expand relationships with existing and new customers. \n\u2022\nWe, and the Helios Pool, are subject to risks with respect to counterparties which could cause us to suffer losses or negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nWe expect to be dependent on a limited number of customers for a material part of our revenues.\n\u2022\nRestrictions on VLGC transits and increased toll charges at the Panama Canal may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur indebtedness and financial obligations may adversely affect our operational flexibility. \n\u2022\nOur existing and future debt and financing agreements contain and are expected to contain restrictive covenants that may limit our liquidity and corporate activities. \n\u2022\nWe may be adversely affected by developments and exposed to volatility in the SOFR market.\n\u2022\nWe have and may in the future selectively enter into derivative contracts, which can result in higher than market interest rates and charges against our income and could result in losses. \n\u2022\nBecause we generate all of our revenues in U.S. dollars but incur a portion of our expenses in other currencies, exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to manage our growth properly or effectively time investments, we may incur significant expenses and \n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\nlosses and prevent the implementation of our business strategy.\n\u2022\nIf our fleet grows in size, we may need to update our operations and financial systems and recruit additional staff and crew.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key personnel without incurring substantial expense.\n\u2022\nOur directors and officers may in the future hold direct or indirect interests in companies that compete with us.\n\u2022\nOur business and operations involve inherent operating risks, and our insurance and indemnities from our customers may not be adequate to cover potential losses from our operations.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future and may be required to make additional premium payments.\n\u2022\nWe may incur increasing costs for the drydocking, maintenance or replacement of our vessels as they age, and, the risks associated with older vessels could adversely affect our ability to obtain profitable charters.\n\u2022\nIf we purchase secondhand vessels, we will be exposed to increased costs.\n\u2022\nCertain shareholders have a substantial ownership stake in us, and their interests could conflict with the interests of our other shareholders.\n\u2022\nUnited States tax authorities could treat us as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company.\u201d \n\u2022\nWe may have to pay tax on United States source shipping income, which would reduce our earnings.\n\u200b\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nThe cyclical nature of seaborne LPG transportation may lead to significant changes in charter rates, vessel utilization and vessel values, which may adversely affect our revenues, profitability and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nA shift in consumer demand from LPG towards other energy sources or changes to trade patterns may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u25cf\nThe market values of our vessels may fluctuate significantly. \n\u25cf\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders and other market participants with respect to our ESG policies may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks.\n\u25cf\nGeneral economic, political and regulatory conditions, as well as macroeconomic conditions, could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations, as well as our future prospects. \n\u25cf\nThe state of global financial markets and general economic conditions, as well as the perceived impact of emissions by our vessels on the climate may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing. \n\u25cf\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could affect our operating results.\n\u25cf\nFuture technological innovation could reduce our charter hire income and the value of our vessels.\n\u25cf\nChanges in fuel, or bunker, prices may adversely affect profits.\n\u25cf\nWe are subject to regulations and liabilities, including environmental laws and restrictions, which could require significant expenditures and adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations. \n\u25cf\nIf our vessels call on ports located in countries or territories that are subject to sanctions or embargoes, it could lead to monetary fines or penalties and/or adversely affect our reputation and the market for our common shares. \n\u25cf\nOur vessels are subject to periodic inspections.\n\u25cf\nMaritime claimants could arrest and governments could requisition our vessels.\n\u25cf\nThe operation of ocean-going vessels is inherently risky, and an incident resulting in significant loss or environmental consequences involving any of our vessels could harm our reputation and business.\n\u25cf\nWe may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nActs of piracy on ocean\n-\ngoing vessels could adversely affect our business.\n\u25cf\nOur operations outside the United States expose us to global risks, such as political instability, terrorism, war, international hostilities and global public health concerns, which may interfere with the operation of our vessels. \n\u25cf\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and resulting sanctions by the United States, European Union and other countries have contributed to inflation, market disruptions and increased volatility in commodity prices. \n\u25cf\nOutbreaks of epidemic and pandemic diseases could adversely affect our business.\n\u25cf\nIf labor or other interruptions are not resolved in a timely manner, such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\u25cf\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches, including as a result of cybersecurity attacks, could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition and expose us to litigation.\n\u200b\n30\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRisks Relating to Our Common Shares\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nThe price of our common shares has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future, and as a result, investors in our common shares could incur substantial losses.\n\u25cf\nAlthough we have initiated a stock repurchase program, we cannot assure you that we will continue to repurchase shares or that we will\u00a0repurchase shares at favorable prices.\n\u25cf\nWe may be unable to pay dividends in the future. \n\u25cf\nWe are a holding company and depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us in order to satisfy our financial obligations and to make dividend payments.\n\u25cf\nA future sale of shares by major shareholders may reduce the share price.\n\u25cf\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands does not have a well\n-\ndeveloped body of corporate law.\n\u25cf\nIt may be difficult to enforce a United States judgment against us, our officers and our directors.\n\u25cf\nOur organizational documents contain anti-takeover provisions.\n\u200b\nRisks Relating to Our Company\n\u200b\nWe, and the Helios Pool, operate exclusively in the VLGC segment of the LPG shipping industry.\n \nDue to the general lack of industry diversification, adverse developments in the VLGC segment of the LPG shipping industry may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\u200b\nWe currently rely almost exclusively on the cash flow generated from the vessels in our fleet, all of which are VLGCs operating in the LPG shipping industry (including through the Helios Pool). Unlike some other shipping companies, which have vessels of varying sizes that can carry different cargoes, such as containers, dry bulk, crude oil and oil products, we focus and may continue to focus exclusively on VLGCs transporting LPG. Similarly, the Helios Pool also depends exclusively on the cash flow generated from VLGCs operating in the LPG shipping industry. General lack of industry diversification makes us vulnerable to adverse developments in the LPG shipping industry, which would have a significantly greater impact on our business, financial condition and operating results than such lack of diversification would if we or the Helios Pool owned and operated more diverse assets or engaged in more diverse lines of business.\n\u200b\nSeasonal and other fluctuations in respect of spot market charter rates have had in the past and may have in the future a negative effect on our revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, twenty-three vessels from our fleet, including our four time chartered-in vessels, operate in the Helios Pool, which employs vessels on short-term time charters, COAs, or in the spot market, the latter of which exposes us to fluctuations in spot market charter rates. We also employ two of our VLGCs on fixed time charters outside of the Helios Pool. As these fixed time charters expire, we may employ these vessels in the spot market.\nGenerally, VLGC spot market rates are highly seasonal, typically demonstrating strength in the second and third calendar quarters as suppliers build inventory for high consumption during the northern hemisphere winter. However, 12-month time charter rates tend to smooth out these short-term fluctuations and recent LPG shipping market activity has not yielded the expected seasonal results. The successful operation of our vessels in the competitive and highly volatile spot charter market depends on, among other things, obtaining profitable spot charters, which depends greatly on vessel supply and demand and minimizing, to the extent possible, time spent waiting for charters and time spent traveling unladen to retrieve cargo. \nThe spot charter market may fluctuate significantly based upon LPG and LPG vessel supply and demand. The successful operation of our vessels in the competitive spot charter market depends on, among other things, obtaining profitable spot charters and minimizing, to the extent possible, time spent waiting for charters and time spent traveling in ballast to pick up cargo. The spot market is very volatile and there have been and will be periods when spot charter rates decline below the operating cost of vessels. If future spot charter rates decline, we may be unable to operate our vessels trading in the spot market profitably, meet our obligations, including payments on indebtedness, or pay dividends in the future. Furthermore, as charter rates for spot charters are fixed for a single voyage which may last up to several weeks, during periods in which spot charter rates are rising, we will generally experience delays in realizing the benefits from such increases. If spot charter rates decline in the future, then we may not be able to profitably operate our vessels trading \n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\nin the spot market or participating in the Helios Pool; meet our obligations, including payments on indebtedness; or pay dividends.\n\u200b\nFurther, although our two fixed time charters outside of the Helios Pool generally provide reliable revenues, they also limit the portion of our fleet available for spot market voyages during an upswing in the market, when spot market voyages might be more profitable. Conversely, when the current charters for the two vessels in our fleet on fixed time charters outside of the Helios Pool expire (or if such charters are terminated early), we may not be able to re-charter these vessels at similar or higher rates, or at all. As a result, we may have to accept lower rates or experience off hire time for our vessels, which would adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u200b\nWe and/or our pool managers may not be able to successfully secure employment for our vessels or vessels in the Helios Pool, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of May 25, 2023, twenty-three of our vessels, including our four time chartered-in vessels, are operating within the Helios Pool, which employs vessels on short-term time charters, COAs, or in the spot market, and two of our vessels are on fixed time charters outside of the Helios Pool that expire between the first calendar quarter of 2024 and the fourth calendar quarter of 2024. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in finding employment for our vessels in the spot market, on time charters or otherwise, or that any employment will be at profitable rates. Moreover, as vessels entered into the Helios Pool are commercially managed by our wholly-owned subsidiary and Phoenix, we also cannot assure you that we or they will be successful in finding employment for the vessels in the Helios Pool or that any employment will be profitable. Any inability to locate suitable employment for our vessels or the vessels in the Helios Pool could affect our general financial condition, results of operation and cash flow as well as the availability of financing.\n\u200b\nWe face substantial competition in trying to expand relationships with existing customers and obtain new customers.\n\u200b\nThe process of obtaining new charter agreements is highly competitive and generally involves an intensive screening and competitive bidding process, which, in certain cases, extends for several months. Contracts in the time charter market are awarded based upon a variety of factors, including:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe size, age, fuel efficiency, emissions levels, and condition of a vessel; \n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe charter rates offered;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe operator\u2019s industry relationships, experience and reputation for customer service, quality operations and safety;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe quality, experience and technical capability of the crew;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe experience of the crew with the operator and type of vessel;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe operator\u2019s relationships with shipyards and the ability to get suitable berths;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe operator\u2019s construction management experience, including the ability to obtain on-time delivery of new vessels according to customer specifications; and \n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe operator's willingness to accept operational risks pursuant to the charter, such as allowing termination of the charter for force majeure events.\n\u200b\nContracts in the spot market are awarded based upon a variety of factors as well, and include:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe location of the vessel; and \n\u200b\n\u25cf\ncompetitiveness of the charter rate offered.\n\u200b\nOur vessels, and the vessels operating in the Helios Pool, operate in a highly competitive market and we expect substantial competition for providing transportation services from a number of companies (both LPG vessel owners and \n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\noperators). We anticipate that an increasing number of maritime transport companies, including many with strong reputations and extensive resources and experience, has entered or will enter the LPG shipping market. Our existing and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial resources than us. In addition, competitors with greater resources may have larger fleets, or could operate larger fleets through consolidations, acquisitions, newbuildings or pooling of their vessels with other companies, and, therefore, may be able to offer a more competitive service than us or the Helios Pool, including better charter rates. We expect competition from a number of experienced companies providing contracts for gas transportation services to potential LPG customers, including state-sponsored entities and major energy companies affiliated with the projects requiring shipping services. As a result, we (including the Helios Pool) may be unable to expand our relationships with existing customers or to obtain new customers on a profitable basis, if at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\u200b\nWe and the Helios Pool are subject to risks with respect to counterparties, and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\n\u200b\nWe have entered into, and expect to enter into in the future, various contracts that are material to the operation of our business, including charter agreements, COAs, shipbuilding contracts, credit facilities and financing arrangements, including leasing arrangements, that subject us to counterparty risks. Similarly, the Helios Pool has entered into, and expects to enter into in the future, various contracts, including charters and COAs, that subject it to counterparty risks. The ability and willingness of our and the Helios Pool\u2019s counterparties to perform their obligations under any contract will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the maritime and LPG industries, the overall financial condition of the counterparty, charter rates for specific types of vessels, and various expenses. For example, a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in world trade or the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in the ability of our charterers or the Helios Pool\u2019s charterers to make required charter payments. In addition, in depressed market conditions, charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that is then under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates. As a result, charterers and customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of their existing charter agreements or avoid their obligations under those contracts. Should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under agreements with us or the Helios Pool, we could sustain significant losses and a significant reduction in the charter hire we earn from the Helios Pool, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders in the amounts anticipated or at all.\n\u200b\nAlthough we assess the creditworthiness of our counterparties, a prolonged period of difficult industry conditions could lead to changes in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity and increase our exposure to credit risk and bad debts. In addition, we may offer extended payment terms to our customers in order to secure contracts, which may lead to more frequent collection issues and adversely affect our financial results and liquidity.\n\u200b\nWe expect to be dependent on a limited number of customers for a material part of our revenues, and failure of such customers to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\n\u200b\nFor the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023, the Helios Pool accounted for 94% of our total revenues. No other individual charterer accounted for more than 10%. Within the Helios Pool, two charterers represented more than 10% of net pool revenues\u2014related party for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023. We expect that a material portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers. The ability of each of our customers to perform their obligations under a contract with us will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control. Should the aforementioned customers fail to honor their obligations under agreements with us or the Helios Pool, we could sustain material losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n \n\u200b\nRestrictions on VLGC transits and increased toll charges at the Panama Canal may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\u200b\nIn June 2016, the expansion of the Panama Canal, or the Canal, was completed. The new locks allow the Canal to accommodate significantly larger vessels, including VLGCs, which we operate. Since the completion of the Canal, transit from the United States Gulf to Asia, an important trade route for our customers, has been shortened by \n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\napproximately 15 days compared to transiting via the Cape of Good Hope. According to industry sources, over 90% of the US-to-Asia LPG voyages had switched to the Canal by November 2016 and the majority of USA-to-Asia LPG voyages continue to utilize the Panama Canal as of the date of this Annual Report. With increased traffic, the toll has been increased over time. The Panama Canal Authorities decreed that the slots for transit by VLGCs could only be reserved up to 14 days in advance of a proposed transit. This change has resulted in longer wait times and resales of slots among VLGC operators at significantly higher rates than those charged by the Panama Canal Authority. These restrictions have added waiting time to transits, which is typically not paid for by charterers. In April 2022 the Panama Canal Authority proposed a comprehensive restructuring of its toll structure, which would increase rates charged on cargo, including the LPG that crosses the waterway, result in increased rates or additional waiting time for our VLGCs to cross the Canal. Such factors are not generally reflected in charter rates. This proposal was approved in July 2022 and began its phase-in period in January 2023, which will continue until January 2025. Our vessels and voyages could be impacted as phase-in continues, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Our latest two long-term time chartered-in Dual-fuel ECO VLGCs are Panamax vessels and can transit the old Panama Canal locks, which are not currently affected by the toll restructuring referenced above.\n \n\u200b\nOur indebtedness and financial obligations may adversely affect our operational flexibility and financial condition. \n\u200b\nAs of March\u00a031,\u00a02023, we had outstanding indebtedness of $663.6 million, of which $491.6 million is hedged or fixed. Amounts owed under our current credit facility and financing arrangements, and any future credit facilities or financing arrangements, will require us to dedicate a part of our cash flow from operations to paying interest and principal payments, as applicable. These payments will limit funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases and other purposes and may also limit our ability to undertake further equity or debt financing in the future. Our indebtedness and obligations under our financing arrangements also increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limits our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry, and places us at a disadvantage to other, less leveraged, competitors.\nOur credit facility and several of our Japanese financing arrangements bear interest at variable rates and we anticipate that any future credit facilities will also bear interest at variable rates. Increases in prevailing rates could increase the amounts that we would have to pay to our lenders or financing counterparties, even though the outstanding principal amount remains the same, and our net income and available cash flows would decrease as a result. \nWe expect our earnings and cash flow to vary from year to year mainly due to the cyclical nature of the LPG shipping industry. If we do not generate or reserve enough cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt or financing obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nseeking to raise additional capital;\n\u25cf\nrefinancing or restructuring our debt or financing obligations;\n\u25cf\nselling our VLGCs; and/or\n\u25cf\nreducing or delaying capital investments.\n\u200b\nHowever, these alternative financing plans, if necessary, may not be sufficient to allow us to meet our debt or financing obligations. If we are unable to meet our debt or financing obligations and we default on our obligations under our debt agreement or financing arrangements, our lenders could elect to declare our outstanding borrowings and certain other amounts owed, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and foreclose on the vessels securing that debt, and our counterparties may seek to repossess the vessels subject to our debt agreement or financing arrangements.\n\u200b\nOur existing and future debt and financing agreements contain and are expected to contain restrictive covenants that may limit our liquidity and corporate activities, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\u200b\nOur debt agreement and financing arrangements contain, and any future debt agreements or financing arrangements are expected to contain, customary covenants and event of default clauses, including cross-default provisions that may be triggered by a default under one of our other contracts or agreements and restrictive covenants and performance \n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\nrequirements, which may affect operational and financial flexibility. Such restrictions could affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock, incur additional indebtedness, create liens, sell assets, or engage in mergers or acquisitions. These restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwise restrict corporate activities. There can be no assurance that such restrictions will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs.\n\u200b\nOur agreements relating to the debt facility that we entered into in July 2022 with a group of banks and financial institutions(the \u201c2022 Debt Facility\u201d), which were secured by, among other things, ten of our VLGCs, require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial covenants. \n\u200b\nOur agreements relating to the $83.4 million debt facility that we entered into in December 2021 with Banc of America Leasing & Capital, LLC, Pacific Western Bank, Raymond James Bank, a Florida chartered bank and City National Bank of Florida, as lenders (\u201cBALCAP Facility\u201d)\n, which are secured by, among other things, two of our VLGCs,\n require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial covenants. \u00a0\n\u200b\nAs of March\u00a031,\u00a02023, we were in compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in the 2022 Debt Facility and the BALCAP Facility. As of May 25, 2023, approximately $225.0 million remains outstanding under the 2022 Debt Facility and approximately $73.5 million remains outstanding under the BALCAP Facility. \n\u200b\nThe 2022 Debt Facility conditions payments of dividends by us to our shareholders and by our subsidiaries to us on the absence of an event of default and such payments not creating an event of default. \n\u200b\nAs a result of the restrictions in our debt agreement and financing arrangements, or similar restrictions in our future debt agreements or financing arrangements, we may need to seek permission from our lenders or counterparties in order to engage in certain corporate actions. Our lenders\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 interests may be different from ours and we may not be able to obtain their permission when needed or at all. This may prevent us from taking actions that we believe are in our best interest, which may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. \n\u200b\nA failure by us to meet our payment and other obligations, including our financial and value to loan covenants, could lead to defaults under our current or future secured loan agreements. In addition, a default under one of our current or future credit facilities could result in the cross-acceleration of our other indebtedness. Our lenders could then accelerate our indebtedness and foreclose on our fleet.\n\u200b\nThe market values of our vessels may decrease, which could cause us to breach covenants in our loan agreements or record an impairment loss, or negatively impact our ability to enter into future financing arrangements, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\u200b\nThe 2022 Debt Facility and BALCAP Facility, which are secured by, among other things, liens on the vessels in our fleet contain various financial covenants, including requirements relating to our financial condition, financial performance and liquidity. For example, we are required to maintain a minimum ratio of the market value of the vessels securing a loan to the principal amount outstanding under such loan. The market value of LPG carriers is sensitive to, among other things, changes in the LPG carrier charter markets, with vessel values deteriorating when LPG carrier charter rates are anticipated to fall and improving when charter rates are anticipated to rise. LPG vessel values remain subject to significant fluctuations. A decline in the fair market values of our vessels could result in us not being in compliance with certain of these loan covenants. Furthermore, if the value of our vessels deteriorates and our estimated future cash flows decrease, we may have to record an impairment adjustment in our financial statements or we may be unable to enter into future financing arrangements acceptable to us or at all, which would adversely affect our financial results and further hinder our ability to raise capital.\n\u200b\nIf we are unable to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants in our 2022 Debt Facility and BALCAP Facility, financing arrangements, or in future debt financing agreements, and we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders or counterparties for such noncompliance, a default could occur under the terms of those agreements. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants, including meeting financial ratios and tests, is dependent on our future performance and may be affected by events beyond our control. If a default occurs under these \n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\nagreements, lenders could terminate their commitments to lend or in some circumstances accelerate the outstanding loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. Our vessels serve as security under our debt agreement. If our lenders were to foreclose with respect to their liens on our vessels in the event of a default, such foreclosure could impair our ability to continue our operations. In addition, our current debt agreement contains, and future debt agreements are expected to contain, cross-default provisions, meaning that if we are in default under certain of our current or future debt obligations, amounts outstanding under our current or other future debt agreements may also be in default, accelerated and become due and payable. If any of these events occur, we cannot guarantee that our assets will be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness, and we may be unable to find alternative financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, that financing might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. In addition, if we find it necessary to sell our vessels at a time when vessel prices are low, we will recognize losses and a reduction in our earnings, which could affect our ability to raise additional capital necessary for us to comply with our debt agreement.\n \n\u200b\nWe may be adversely affected by developments in the SOFR market, changes in the methods by which SOFR is determined or the use of alternative reference rates.\nIn 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intended to phase out LIBOR, and in 2021, it announced that all LIBOR fixings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of one-week and two-month U.S. Dollar settings, and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining U.S. Dollar settings. The Federal Reserve also has advised banks to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate. \nThe Alternative Refinance Rate Committee, a committee convened by the Federal Reserve that includes major market participants, has identified SOFR, an index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by U.S. Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR in the United States.\nAlthough SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for U.S. Dollar LIBOR and has been adopted as the benchmark interest rate for our debt arrangements, it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, and there can be no assurance that they will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark interest rates, substantially higher financing costs or a shortage of available debt financing, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations, and our ability to pay dividends.\nWe have and we intend to selectively enter into derivative contracts, which can result in higher than market interest rates and charges against our income.\nWe have entered into and may selectively in the future enter into derivative contracts to hedge our overall exposure to interest rate risk related to our credit facility. Entering into swaps and derivatives transactions is inherently risky and presents various possibilities for incurring significant expenses. The derivatives strategies that we employ currently and, in the future, may not be successful or effective, and we could, as a result, incur substantial additional interest costs or losses.\n\u200b\nWe are exposed to volatility in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which has only been published since April 2018\n. \nDue to the planned phase out of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, as a benchmark for floating rate loans entered into after 2021, all loans and financing agreements into which we have entered since the beginning of 2022 have been based on the one or three month Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. However, since we entered into both the \nCresques \nand the \nCaptain Markos \nJapanese financing arrangements in 2021, we amended the applicable floating interest rate on both financings in accordance with guidance given by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, a committee convened by the Federal Reserve that includes major market participants. The guidelines suggest adding a credit adjustment spread, or CAS, to the previously agreed floating rate margin based on the floating rate reset interval because SOFR is based on secured loans, while LIBOR was an unsecured rate. In accordance with these recommendations, the applicable margin on the \nCresques\n Japanese financing arrangement and the \nCaptain Markos \nJapanese financing arrangement, which are now both based on the one-month SOFR, have been increased by the CAS of 0.11448%.\n\u200b\n36\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe amounts outstanding under our 2022 Facility and certain of our existing Japanese financing arrangements were originally advanced or were modified to be priced on the basis of a floating rate based on SOFR. Changes in SOFR could affect the amount of interest payable on our debt, and, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow. Until recent years, global interest rates, including SOFR, have been at relatively low levels, but they have risen recently and may continue to rise in the future. SOFR has only been published by the Federal Reserve since April 2018, and therefore there is limited history with which to assess how changes in SOFR rates may differ from other rates during different macroeconomic and monetary policy conditions. \u00a0\n \n\u200b\nWe have and may in the future selectively enter into derivative contracts, which can result in higher than market interest rates and charges against our income\n.\nOur financial condition could be materially adversely affected at any time that we have not entered into interest rate hedging arrangements to hedge our exposure to the interest rates applicable to our credit facilities and any other financing arrangements we may enter into in the future. We have entered into and may selectively in the future enter into derivative contracts to hedge our overall exposure to interest rate risk related to our credit facility. Entering into swaps and derivatives transactions is inherently risky and presents various possibilities for incurring significant expenses. Moreover, even if we have entered into interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments for purposes of managing our interest rate exposure, our hedging strategies may not be effective and we may incur substantial losses. As of May 25, 2023, $170.1 million of our total debt of $658.9 million, or 25.9%, is unhedged or unfixed and a significant change in SOFR could materially adversely affect our financial condition, although we note that a theoretical 20 basis point increase or decrease in SOFR would only result in a $0.4 million over the next 12 months. \n\u200b\nInvestments in forward freight derivative instruments could result in losses.\n\u00a0\nFrom time to time, we may take hedging or speculative positions in derivative instruments, including freight forward agreements, or FFAs. Upon settlement, if an FFA contracted charter rate is less than the average of the rates, as reported by an identified index, for the specified route and period, the seller of the FFA is required to pay the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the contracted rate and the settlement rate, multiplied by the number of days in the specified period. Conversely, if the contracted rate is greater than the settlement rate, the buyer is required to pay the seller the settlement sum. If we do not correctly anticipate charter rate movements over the specified route and time period when we take positions in FFAs or other derivative instruments, we could suffer losses in the settling or termination of the FFA. This could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. As of March\u00a031,\u00a02023, we had no FFAs in our portfolio.\n\u200b\nBecause we generate all of our revenues in U.S. dollars but incur a portion of our expenses in other currencies, exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u200b\nWe generate all of our revenues in U.S. dollars and the majority of our expenses are also in U.S. dollars. However, a portion of our overall expenses is incurred in other currencies, particularly Euro, Singapore Dollar, Danish Krone, Japanese Yen, British Pound Sterling, and Norwegian Krone. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies, in particular the Euro, or the amount of expenses we incur in other currencies could cause fluctuations in our net income. See \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u2014Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.\u201d\n\u200b\nIf we fail to manage our growth properly, we may incur significant expenses and losses.\n\u200b\nAs and when market conditions permit, we may prudently grow our fleet. Acquisition opportunities may arise from time to time, and any such acquisition could be significant. Successfully consummating and integrating acquisitions will depend on:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nlocating and acquiring suitable vessels at a suitable price;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nidentifying and completing acquisitions or joint ventures;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nintegrating any acquired vessels or businesses successfully with our existing operations;\n37\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nhiring, training and retaining qualified personnel and crew to manage and operate our growing business and fleet;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nexpanding our customer base; and\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nobtaining required financing.\n\u200b\nCertain acquisition and investment opportunities may not result in the consummation of a transaction and the incurrence of certain advisory costs. Any acquisition could involve the payment by us of a substantial amount of cash, the incurrence of a substantial amount of debt or the issuance of a substantial amount of equity. In addition, we may not be able to obtain acceptable terms for the required financing for any such acquisition or investment that arises.\n\u200b\nGrowing a business by acquisition presents numerous risks such as undisclosed liabilities and obligations, difficulty in obtaining additional qualified personnel, managing relationships with customers and suppliers and integrating newly acquired vessels into existing infrastructures. Moreover, acquiring any business is subject to risks related to incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets. \n\u200b\nAdditionally, the expansion of our fleet may impose significant additional responsibilities on our management and staff, including the management and staff of our in-house commercial and technical managers, and may necessitate that we increase the number of our personnel. Further, there is the risk that we may fail to successfully and timely integrate the operations or management of any acquired businesses or assets and the risk of diverting management's attention from existing operations or other priorities. If we fail to consummate and integrate our acquisitions in a timely and cost-effective manner, our financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay dividends, if any, to our shareholders could be adversely affected. Moreover, we cannot predict the effect, if any, that any announcement or consummation of an acquisition would have on the trading price of our common shares.\n\u200b\nAn inability to effectively time investments in and divestments of vessels could prevent the implementation of our business strategy and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur strategy is to own and operate a fleet large enough to provide global coverage, but not larger than what the demand for our services can support over a longer period by both contracting newbuildings and through acquisitions and divestitures in the second-hand market. Our business is influenced by the timing of investments, including strategic and vessel acquisitions, time charter in arrangements and the contracting of newbuildings, and/or divestments of such investments or existing assets. If we are unable to identify the optimal timing of such investments or divestments in relation to the shipping value cycle due to capital restraints, or otherwise, this could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, future performance, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nIf our fleet grows in size, we may need to update our operations and financial systems and recruit additional staff and crew; if we cannot adequately update these systems or recruit suitable employees, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAs and when market conditions permit, we intend to continue to prudently grow our fleet over the long term. We have and may continue to have to invest in upgrading our operating and financial systems. In addition, we may have to recruit additional well-qualified seafarers and shoreside administrative and management personnel. We may not be able to hire suitable employees to the extent we continue to expand our fleet. Our vessels require technically skilled staff with specialized training. If our crewing agents are unable to employ such technically skilled staff, they may not be able to adequately staff our vessels. If we are unable to operate our financial and operations systems effectively or we are unable to recruit suitable employees as we expand our fleet, our results of operation and our ability to expand our fleet may be adversely affected.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n38\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key management personnel and other employees in the shipping industry without incurring substantial expense, which may negatively affect the effectiveness of our management and our results of operations.\n\u200b\nThe successful development and performance of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled professionals with appropriate experience and expertise. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\n\u200b\nAdditionally, obtaining voyage and time charters with leading industry participants depends on a number of factors, including the ability to man vessels with suitably experienced, high-quality masters, officers and crew. In recent years, the limited supply of and increased demand for well-qualified crew has created upward pressure on crewing costs, which we generally bear under our time and spot charters. Increases in crew costs may adversely affect our profitability. In addition, if we cannot retain sufficient numbers of quality on-board seafaring personnel, our fleet utilization will decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\u200b\nOur directors and officers may in the future hold direct or indirect interests in companies that compete with us.\n\u200b\nOur directors and officers have a history of involvement in the shipping industry and some of them currently, and some of them may in the future, directly or indirectly, hold investments in companies that compete with us. In that case, they may face conflicts between their own interests and their obligations to us.\n\u200b\nWe cannot provide assurance that our directors and officers will not be influenced by their interests in or affiliation with other shipping companies, or our competitors, and seek to cause us to take courses of action that might involve risks to our other shareholders or adversely affect us or our shareholders. However, we have written policies in place to address such situations if they arise.\n\u200b\nOur business and operations involve inherent operating risks, and our insurance and indemnities from our customers may not be adequate to cover potential losses from our operations.\nOur vessels are subject to a variety of operational risks caused by adverse weather conditions, mechanical failures, human error, war, terrorism, piracy, or other circumstances or events, including the recent conflict between Russia and Ukraine. While we endeavor to be adequately insured against all known risks related to the operation of our ships, there will always be a possibility that we may not have adequate insurance coverage for complete cover against a loss or a liability. The insurers may also not pay particular claims due to exclusions in the policy. Further, even if our insurance coverage is adequate, we may not be able to timely obtain a replacement vessel in the event of a loss. Also, there can be no assurance that insurance coverages will remain available at acceptable rates. Furthermore, such insurance coverage will contain deductibles, limitations and exclusions, which are standard in the shipping industry and may increase our costs or lower our revenue if applied in respect of any claim.\n\u200b\nWe may be unable to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future.\nWe may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at acceptable rates in the future during adverse insurance market conditions. For example, more stringent environmental regulations have led in the past to increased costs for, and in the future may result in the lack of availability of, insurance against risks of environmental damage or pollution. A marine disaster could exceed our insurance coverage, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Any uninsured or underinsured loss could harm our business and financial condition. In addition, our insurance may be voidable by the insurers as a result of certain of our actions, such as our vessels failing to maintain certification with applicable maritime self-regulatory organizations even when such failure is not caused intentionally or by negligence, but, for example, due to computer error or external manipulation.\nChanges in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may also make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain. In addition, upon renewal or expiration of our current policies, the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than our existing coverage.\n39\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBecause we obtain some of our insurance through protection and indemnity associations, we may be required to make additional premium payments.\nAlthough we believe we carry P&I cover consistent with industry standards, all risks may not be adequately insured against, and any particular claim may not be paid. Any claims covered by insurance would be subject to deductibles, and since it is possible that a large number of claims may be brought, the aggregate amount of these deductibles could be material. Certain of our insurance coverage is maintained through mutual P&I clubs, and as a member of such associations we may be required to make additional payments, or calls, over and above budgeted premiums if total member claims exceed association reserves. These calls will be in amounts based on our claim records, as well as the claim records of other members of the P&I clubs through which we receive insurance coverage for tort liability, including pollution-related liability. Our payment of these calls could result in significant expense to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends.\n\u200b\nWe may incur increasing costs for the drydocking, maintenance or replacement of our vessels as they age, and, as our vessels age, the risks associated with older vessels could adversely affect our ability to obtain profitable charters.\n\u200b\nThe drydocking of our vessels requires significant capital expenditures and loss of revenue while our vessels are off-hire. Any significant increase in the number of days of off-hire due to such drydocking or in the costs of any repairs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Although we do not anticipate that more than one vessel will be out of service at any given time, we may underestimate the time required to drydock our vessels, or unanticipated problems may arise.\n\u200b\nIn addition, although all of our vessels were built within the past fifteen years, we estimate that our vessels have a useful life of 25 years. In general, the costs of maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase with the age of the vessel. Older vessels are typically less fuel-efficient than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in engine technology. Cargo insurance rates increase with the age of a vessel, making older vessels less desirable to charterers.\n\u200b\nAs our vessels become older, we may have to replace such vessels upon the expiration of their useful lives. Unless we maintain reserves or are able to borrow or raise funds for vessel replacement, we will be unable to replace such older vessels. The inability to replace the vessels in our fleet upon the expiration of their useful lives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Any reserves set aside for vessel replacement will not be available for the payment of dividends to shareholders.\n\u200b\nIf we purchase secondhand vessels, we may be exposed to increased costs which could adversely affect our earnings.\n\u200b\nWe may acquire secondhand vessels in the future, and while we inspect previously owned or secondhand vessels prior to purchase, that inspection does not provide us with the same knowledge about their condition and cost of any required (or anticipated) repairs that we would have had if these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by us. A secondhand vessel may also have conditions or defects that we were not aware of when we bought the vessel and which may require us to incur costly repairs to the vessel. These repairs may require us to put a vessel into drydock, which would reduce our fleet utilization and increase our operating costs. The market prices of secondhand vessels also tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuild vessels, and if we sell the vessels, the sales prices may not equal and could be less than their carrying values at that time. Therefore, our future operating results could be negatively affected if our secondhand vessels do not perform as we expect.\n\u200b\nCertain shareholders have a substantial ownership stake in us, and their interests could conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. \n\u200b\nAccording to information contained in public filings, John C. Hadjipateras, our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors; Blackrock, Inc.; and Dimensional Fund Advisors LP, as of May 25, 2023, own, or may be deemed to beneficially own, 13.7%, 13.4%, and 7.2%, respectively, of our total shares outstanding. John C. Hadjipateras, as our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors, has the ability to influence certain actions requiring shareholders' approval, including increasing or decreasing the authorized share capital, the election of directors, declaration of dividends, the appointment of management, and other policy decisions. While any \n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\nfuture transaction with significant shareholders could benefit us, their interests could at times conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. Conflicts of interest may also arise between us and our significant shareholders or their affiliates, which may result in the conclusion of transactions on terms not determined by market forces. Any such conflicts of interest could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common shares. Moreover, the concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other shareholders or deprive shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our business. Similarly, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with concentrated ownership.\n\u200b\nUnited States tax authorities could treat us as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company,\u201d which could have adverse United States federal income tax consequences to United States holders. \n\u200b\nA foreign corporation will be treated as a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for any taxable year consists of \u201cpassive income\u201d or (2) at least 50% of the average value of the corporation\u2019s assets produce or are held for the production of \u201cpassive income.\u201d For purposes of these tests, \u201cpassive income\u201d generally includes dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. For purposes of these tests, income derived from the performance of services generally does not constitute \u201cpassive income.\u201d United States shareholders of a PFIC are subject to an adverse United States federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the distributions they receive from the PFIC and the gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their shares in the PFIC.\n\u200b\nWhether we will be treated as a PFIC for our taxable year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023 and subsequent taxable years will depend upon the nature and extent of our operations. In this regard, we intend to treat the gross income we derive from our voyage and time chartering activities as services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, such income should not constitute passive income, and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of such income, in particular, our vessels, should not constitute passive assets for purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC. There is substantial legal authority supporting this position consisting of case law and the United States Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, pronouncements concerning the characterization of income derived from time charters as services income for other tax purposes. However, there is also authority which characterizes time charter income as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the IRS or a court of law will accept this position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. In addition, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner to avoid being classified as a PFIC with respect to any taxable year, we cannot assure you that the nature of our operations will not change in the future.\n\u200b\nFor any taxable year in which we are, or were to be treated as, a PFIC, United States shareholders would face adverse United States federal income tax consequences. Under the PFIC rules, unless a shareholder makes an election available under the Code (which election could itself have adverse consequences for such shareholders, as discussed below under \u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Taxation\u2014United States Federal Income Tax Considerations\u2014United States Federal Income Taxation of United States Holders\u201d), excess distributions and any gain from the disposition of such shareholder's common shares would be allocated ratably over the shareholder's holding period of the common shares and the amounts allocated to the taxable year of the excess distribution or sale or other disposition and to any year before we became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to each other taxable year would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for individuals or corporations, as appropriate, for that taxable year, and an interest charge would be imposed with respect to such tax. See \u201cItem 1. Taxation\u2014United States Federal Income Tax Considerations\u2014United States Federal Income Taxation of United States Holders\u201d for a more comprehensive discussion of the United States federal income tax consequences to United States shareholders if we are treated as a PFIC.\n\u200b\nWe may have to pay tax on United States source shipping income, which would reduce our earnings.\n\u200b\nUnder the Code, 50% of the gross shipping income of a corporation that owns or charters vessels, as we and our subsidiaries do, that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States may be subject to a 4%, or an effective 2%, United States federal income tax without allowance for deduction, \n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\nunless that corporation qualifies for exemption from tax under Section 883 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\u200b\nWe believe that we qualify, and we expect to qualify, for exemption under Section 883 for our taxable year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023 and our subsequent taxable years and we intend to take this position for United States federal income tax return reporting purposes. However, there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause us to lose the benefit of this tax exemption and thereby become subject to United States federal income tax on our United States source shipping income. For example, we would no longer qualify for exemption under Section 883 of the Code for a particular taxable year if certain \u201cnon-qualified\u201d shareholders with a 5% or greater interest in our common shares owned, in the aggregate, 50% or more of our outstanding common shares for more than half the days during the taxable year. Due to the factual nature of the issues involved, there can be no assurances that we or any of our subsidiaries will qualify for exemption under Section 883 of the Code.\n\u200b\nIf we or our subsidiaries were not entitled to exemption under Section 883 of the Code for any taxable year based on our failure to satisfy the publicly-traded test, we or our subsidiaries would be subject for such year to an effective 2% United States federal income tax on the gross shipping income we or our subsidiaries derive during the year that is attributable to the transport of cargoes to or from the United States. The imposition of this taxation would have a negative effect on our business and would decrease our earnings available for distribution to our shareholders.\n\u200b\nRisks Relating to Our Industry \n\u200b\nThe cyclical nature of seaborne LPG transportation may lead to significant changes in charter rates, vessel utilization and vessel values, which may adversely affect our revenues, profitability and financial condition.\n\u200b\nHistorically, the LPG shipping market has been cyclical with attendant volatility in profitability, charter rates and vessel values. The degree of charter rate volatility among different types of gas carriers has varied widely. Because many factors influencing the supply of, and demand for, vessel capacity are unpredictable, the timing, direction and degree of changes in the LPG shipping market are also not predictable. If charter rates decline, our earnings may decrease, particularly with respect to our vessels deployed in the spot market, including through the Helios Pool, but also with respect to our other vessels when their charters expire, as they may not be rechartered on favorable terms when compared to the terms of the expiring charters. Accordingly, a decline in charter rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues, profitability, liquidity, cash flow and financial position.\n\u200b\nFuture growth in the demand for LPG carriers and charter rates will depend on economic growth in the world economy and demand for LPG transportation that exceeds the capacity of the growing worldwide LPG carrier fleet. We believe that the future growth in demand for LPG carriers and the charter rate levels for LPG carriers will depend primarily upon the supply and demand for LPG, particularly in the economies of China, India, Japan, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and the United States and upon seasonal and regional changes in demand and changes to the capacity of the world fleet. The capacity of the world LPG shipping fleet appears likely to increase in the near term. Economic growth may be limited in the near term, and possibly for an extended period, as a result of global economic conditions, or otherwise, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u200b\nThe factors affecting the supply of and demand for LPG carriers are outside of our control, and the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable.\n\u200b\nThe factors that influence demand for our vessels include:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nglobal or regional economic, political or geopolitical conditions, including armed conflicts, including the recent conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist activities, embargoes, strikes, tariffs and \u201ctrade wars,\u201d particularly in LPG consuming regions;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nchanges in global or general industrial activity specifically in the plastics and chemical industries;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nchanges in the cost of oil and natural gas from which LPG is derived;\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nchanges in the consumption of LPG or natural gas due to availability of new, alternative energy sources or changes in the price of LPG or natural gas relative to other energy sources or other factors making consumption of LPG or natural gas less attractive;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nsupply of and demand for LPG;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe development and location of production facilities for LPG;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nregional imbalances in production and demand of LPG; \n\u200b\n\u25cf\nchanges in the production levels of crude oil and natural gas (including in particular production by OPEC, the United States and other key producers) and inventories;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe distance LPG is to be moved by sea;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nworldwide production of natural gas;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\navailability of competing LPG vessels;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\navailability of alternative transportation means, including pipelines for LPG, which are currently few in number, linking production areas and industrial and residential areas consuming LPG, or the conversion of existing non\n-\npetroleum gas pipelines to petroleum gas pipelines in those markets;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nchanges in the price of crude oil and changes to the West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude Oil pricing benchmarks, and changes in trade patterns;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\ndevelopment and exploitation of alternative fuels and non\n-\nconventional hydrocarbon production;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\ngovernmental regulations, including environmental or restrictions on offshore transportation of natural gas;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nlocal and international political, economic and weather conditions; \n\u200b\n\u25cf\neconomic slowdowns caused by public health events;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign tax policies; \n\u200b\n\u25cf\naccidents, severe weather, natural disasters and other similar incidents relating to the natural gas industry; and \n\u200b\n\u25cf\nsanctions (in particular sanctions on Iran, Russia and Venezuela, among others).\n\u200b\nThe factors that influence the supply of vessel capacity include:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe number of newbuilding deliveries;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe scrapping rate of older vessels;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nLPG vessel prices\n, including financing costs and the price of steel, other raw materials and vessel equipment\n;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe availability of shipyards to build LPG vessels when demand is high;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nchanges in environmental and other regulations that may limit the useful lives of vessels;\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\n\u25cf\ntechnological advances in LPG vessel design and capacity;\n and\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe number of vessels that are out of service.\n\u200b\nA significant decline in demand for the seaborne transport of LPG or a significant increase in the supply of LPG vessel capacity without a corresponding growth in LPG vessel demand could cause a significant decline in prevailing charter rates, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and cash flow.\n\u200b\nProlonged low natural gas and LPG prices could negatively affect us in a number of ways, including the following:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\na reduction in exploration for or development of new natural gas reserves or projects, or the delay or cancellation of existing projects as energy companies lower their capital expenditures budgets, which may reduce our growth opportunities\u037e\n\u200b\n\u25cf\na decrease in the expected returns relating to investments in LPG projects\u037e\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nlow gas prices globally and/or weak differentials between prices in the Atlantic Basin and the Pacific Basin leading to reduced inter-basin trading of LPG and reduced demand for LPG shipping\u037e\n\u200b\n\u25cf\ndecreased demand for the types of vessels we own and operate, which may reduce charter rates and revenue available to us upon redeployment of our vessels following the expiration or termination of existing contracts or upon the initial chartering of vessels\u037e \n\u200b\n\u25cf\ncustomers potentially seeking to renegotiate or terminate existing vessel contracts, or failing to extend or renew contracts upon expiration\u037e\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe inability or refusal of customers to make charter payments to us due to financial constraints or otherwise, including limitations imposed by government sanctions \u037e or\n\u200b\n\u25cf\ndeclines in vessel values, which may result in losses to us upon vessel sales or impairment charges against our earnings and could impact our compliance with the covenants in our loan agreements.\n\u200b\nReduced demand for LPG or LPG fractionation, storage, or shipping, or any reduction or limitation in LPG production capacity, could have a material adverse effect on prevailing charter rates or the market value of our vessels, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u200b\nA shift in consumer demand from LPG towards other energy sources or changes to trade patterns may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSubstantially all of our earnings are related to the LPG industry. In recent years, there has been a strong supply of natural gas and an increase in the construction of plants and projects involving natural gas, of which LPG is a byproduct. If the supply of natural gas decreases, we may see a concurrent reduction in LPG production and resulting lesser demand and lower charter rates for our vessels and the vessels in the Helios Pool, which could ultimately have a material adverse impact on our revenues, operations and future growth. Additionally, changes in environmental or other legislation establishing additional regulation or restrictions on LPG production and transportation, including the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations, or legislation in the United States placing additional regulation or restrictions on LPG production from shale gas could result in reduced demand for LPG shipping.\u00a0\nA shift in the consumer demand from LPG towards other energy resources such as wind energy, solar energy, or water energy will affect the demand for our LPG carriers. This could have a material adverse effect on our future performance, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSeaborne trading and distribution patterns are primarily influenced by the relative advantage of the various sources of production, locations of consumption, pricing differentials and seasonality. Changes to the trade patterns of LPG may have a significant negative or positive impact on the demand for our vessels. This could have a material adverse effect on our future performance, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\n\u200b\nThe market values of our vessels may fluctuate significantly. When the market values of our vessels are low, we may incur a loss on sale of a vessel or record an impairment charge, which may adversely affect our earnings and possibly lead to defaults under our loan agreements or under future loan agreements we may enter into.\n\u200b\nVessel values are both cyclical and volatile, and may fluctuate due to a number of different factors, including general economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry; sophistication and condition of the vessels; types and sizes of vessels; competition from other shipping companies; the availability of other modes of transportation; increases in the supply of vessel capacity; charter rates; the cost and delivery of newbuildings; governmental or other regulations; supply of and demand for LPG; prevailing freight rates; and the need to upgrade secondhand and previously owned vessels as a result of charterer requirements, technological advances in vessel design, equipment propulsion, overall vessel efficiency, or otherwise. In addition, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value.\n\u200b\nDue to the cyclical nature of the market, if for any reason we sell any of our owned vessels at a time when prices are depressed and before we have recorded an impairment adjustment to our financial statements, the sale may be for less than the vessel's carrying value in our financial statements, resulting in a loss and reduction in earnings. Furthermore, if vessel values experience significant declines and our estimated future cash flows decrease, we may have to record an impairment adjustment in our financial statements, which could adversely affect our financial results. If the market value of our fleet declines, we may not be in compliance with certain provisions of our loan agreements and we may not be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing or pay dividends, if any. If we are unable to pledge additional collateral, our lenders could accelerate our debt and foreclose on our vessels.\n\u200b\nThe IMO 2020 regulations have and may continue to cause us to incur substantial costs and to procure low-sulfur fuel oil directly on the wholesale market for storage at sea and onward consumption on our vessels. \n\u200b\nEffective January 1, 2020, the IMO implemented a new regulation for a 0.50% global sulfur cap on emissions from vessels (the \u201cIMO 2020 Regulations\u201d). Under this new global cap, vessels must use marine fuels with a sulfur content of no more than 0.50% against the former regulations specifying a maximum of 3.50% sulfur in an effort to reduce the emission of sulfur oxide into the atmosphere.\n\u200b\nWe have and may continue to incur costs to comply with these revised standards. Additional or new conventions, laws and regulations may be adopted that could require, among others, the installation of expensive emission control systems and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\u200b\nCurrently, twelve of our technically-managed vessels are equipped with scrubbers and, since January 1, 2020, we have transitioned to burning IMO compliant fuels for our non-scrubber equipped vessels. Since the implementation of the IMO 2020 Regulations, scrubber-equipped vessels have been permitted to consume high-sulfur fuels instead of low-sulfur fuels. A decrease in the difference in the costs between low-sulfur fuel and high-sulfur fuel or unavailability of high-sulfur fuel at ports on certain trading routes, may cause us to fail to recognize benefits of operating scrubbers. \n\u200b\nFuel is a significant expense in our shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter and is an important factor in negotiating charter rates. Our operations and the performance of our vessels, and as a result our results of operations, face a host of challenges. These include concerns over higher costs, international compliance, and the availability of both high and low-sulfur fuels at key international bunkering hubs such as Singapore, Houston, Fujairah, or Rotterdam. In addition, we are taking seriously concerns which have recently arisen in Europe that certain blends of low-sulfur fuels can emit greater amounts of harmful black carbon than the high-sulfur fuels they are meant to replace. Costs of compliance with these and other related regulatory changes may be significant and may have a material adverse effect on our future performance, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. As a result, an increase in the price of fuel beyond our expectations may adversely affect our profitability. \n\u200b\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWhile we carry insurance to protect us against certain risks of loss of or damage to the procured commodities, we may not be adequately insured to cover any losses from such operational risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Any significant uninsured or under-insured loss or liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and our available cash.\n\u200b\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders and other market participants with respect to our Environmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) policies may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks .\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, lenders and other market participants are increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. \n\u200b\nIn February 2021, the Acting Chair of the SEC issued a statement directing the Division of Corporation Finance to enhance its focus on climate-related disclosure in public company filings and in March 2021 the SEC announced the creation of a Climate and ESG Task Force in the Division of Enforcement (the \u201cTask Force\u201d). The Task Force\u2019s goal is to develop initiatives to proactively identify ESG-related misconduct consistent with increased investor reliance on climate and ESG-related disclosure and investment. To implement the Task Force\u2019s purpose, the SEC has taken several enforcement actions, with the first enforcement action taking place in May 2022, and promulgated new rules. On March 21, 2022, the SEC proposed that all public companies are to include extensive climate-related information in their SEC filings. On May 25, 2022, SEC proposed a second set of rules aiming to curb the practice of \"greenwashing\" (i.e., making unfounded claims about one's ESG efforts) and would add proposed amendments to rules and reporting forms that apply to registered investment companies and advisers, advisers exempt from registration, and business development companies. These proposed sets of rules are not effective as of the date of this annual report.\n\u200b\nThe increased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors and lenders may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company\u2019s ESG practices. Companies which do not adapt to or comply with investor, lender or other industry shareholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected. For more information with respect to our ESG efforts, please see Item 1. Business\u2014Our Environmental, Social and Governance Efforts.\n\u200b\nWe may face increasing pressures from investors, lenders and other market participants, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. As a result, we may be required to implement more stringent ESG procedures or standards so that our existing and future investors and lenders remain invested in us and make further investments in us, especially given the highly focused and specific trade of LPG transportation in which we are engaged. Such ESG corporate transformation calls for an increased resource allocation to serve the necessary changes in that sector, increasing costs and capital expenditure. If we do not meet these standards, our business and/or our ability to access capital could be harmed. In connection with the 2022 Debt Facility, the margin applicable to certain new facilities (the \u201cNew Facilities\u201d) may be adjusted by up to ten (10) basis points (upwards or downwards) per annum for changes in the average efficiency ratio (\u201cAER\u201d) (which weighs carbon emissions for a voyage against the design deadweight of a vessel and the distance travelled on such voyage) for the vessels in our fleet that are owned or technically managed pursuant to a bareboat charter. \n\u200b\nAdditionally, certain investors and lenders may exclude fossil fuel transport companies, such as us, from their investing portfolios altogether due to environmental, social and governance factors. These limitations in both the debt and equity capital markets may affect our ability to grow as our plans for growth may include accessing the equity and debt capital markets. If those markets are unavailable, or if we are unable to access alternative means of financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to implement our business strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our indebtedness. Further, it is likely that we will incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report and comply with wide-ranging ESG requirements. \n46\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\nFinally, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings and recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with fossil fuel-related assets could lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other, non-fossil fuel markets, which could have a negative impact on our access to and costs of capital. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \n\u200b\nGeneral economic, political and regulatory conditions could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations, as well as our future prospects. \n\u200b\nThe global economy remains subject to downside risks, including substantial sovereign debt burdens in countries throughout the world, the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the EU, or \u201cBrexit\u201d (as described more fully below), continuing turmoil and hostilities in the Middle East, Afghanistan and other geographic areas and the refugee crisis in Europe and the Middle East. There has historically been a strong link between the development of the world economy and demand for LPG shipping. Accordingly, an extended negative outlook for the world economy could reduce the overall demand for our services. More specifically, LPG is used as a feedstock in cyclical businesses, such as the manufacturing of plastics and in the petrochemical industry, which were adversely affected by the economic downturn and, accordingly, continued weakness and any further reduction in demand in those industries could adversely affect the LPG shipping industry. In particular, an adverse change in economic conditions affecting China, India, Japan or Southeast Asia generally could have a negative effect on the demand for LPG, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial position and results of operations, as well as our future prospects. Additionally, Brexit, or similar events in other jurisdictions, could impact global markets, including foreign exchange and securities markets; any resulting changes in currency exchange rates, tariffs, treaties and other regulatory matters could in turn adversely impact our business and operations.\n\u200b\nThe global economy faces a number of challenges, including the effects of volatile oil prices, trade tensions between the United States and China and between the United States and the European Union, continuing turmoil and hostilities in the Middle East, the Korean Peninsula, North Africa, Venezuela, and other geographic areas and countries, including the recent conflict between Russia and Ukraine, continuing threat of terrorist attacks around the world, continuing instability and conflicts and other recent occurrences in the Middle East and in other geographic areas and countries, continuing economic weakness in the European Union, or the E.U., and stabilizing growth in China, as well as public health concerns stemming from the COVID-19 outbreak. The demand for energy, including oil and gas may be negatively affected by global economic conditions.\n\u200b\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has disrupted supply chains and caused instability in the global economy, and the United States and the European Union, among other countries, announced sanctions against the Russian government and its supporters. The United States Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control administers and enforces multiple authorities under which sanctions have been imposed on Russia, including: the Russian Harmful Foreign Activities sanctions program, established by the Russia-related national emergency declared in Executive Order (E.O.) 14024 and subsequently expanded and addressed through certain additional authorities, and the Ukraine-/Russia-related sanctions program, established with the Ukraine-related national emergency declared in E.O. 13660 and subsequently expanded and addressed through certain additional authorities. The United States has also issued several Executive Orders that prohibit certain transactions related to Russia. For example, on March 8, 2022, President Biden issued E.O. 14066, which prohibits the import into the United States of certain energy products of Russian Federation origin, including: crude oil; petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation; liquefied natural gas; coal; and coal products Additionally, among other restrictions, E.O. 14066 prohibits any investments in the Russian energy sector by U.S. persons. The nature and extent of the restricted transactions contained in E.O. 14066 was subsequently expanded by E.O. 14068, signed March 11, 2022 (prohibiting the importation of a wide range of products from Russia and imposing export sanctions on certain luxury goods) and E.O. 14071 (prohibiting all new investment in the Russian Federation by US persons and prohibiting the provision of certain services to any person located in the Russian Federation as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury), and the ongoing conflict could result in the imposition of further economic sanctions or new categories of export restrictions against persons in or connected to Russia.\n\u200b\n47\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to secure funding is dependent on well-functioning capital markets and on an appetite to provide funding to the shipping industry. If global economic conditions continue to worsen, or if capital markets related financing is rendered less accessible or made unavailable to the shipping industry or if lenders for any reason decide not to provide debt financing to us, we may, among other things not be able to secure additional financing to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If additional financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due, or we may be unable to enhance our existing business, complete additional vessel acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.\n\u200b\nCredit markets in the United States and Europe have in the past experienced significant contraction, de-leveraging and reduced liquidity, and there is a risk that the U.S. federal government and state governments and European authorities continue to implement a broad variety of governmental action and/or new regulation of the financial markets. Global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, disrupted and volatile. We face risks attendant to changes in economic environments, changes in interest rates, and instability in the banking and securities markets around the world, among other factors. Major market disruptions may adversely affect our business or impair our ability to borrow amounts under our credit facilities or any future financial arrangements. In the absence of available financing, we also may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. \n\u200b\nWe face risks attendant to changes in economic environments, changes in interest rates, and instability in the banking and securities markets around the world, among other factors. We cannot predict how long the current market conditions will last. However, these recent and developing economic and governmental factors, may have negative effects on charter rates and vessel values, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and may cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline.\n\u200b\nIn Europe, large sovereign debts and fiscal deficits, low growth prospects and high unemployment rates in a number of countries have contributed to the rise of Eurosceptic parties, which would like their countries to leave the European Union. The exit of the United Kingdom, or the U.K., from the European Union, or the EU, as described more fully below and potential new trade policies in the United States further increase the risk of additional trade protectionism.\n\u200b\nIn recent history, China has had one of the world's fastest growing economies in terms of gross domestic product, or GDP, which had a significant impact on shipping demand. Following the emergence of the COVID-19, China experienced reduced industrial activity with temporary closures of factories and other facilities, labor shortages and restrictions on travel as part of its \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy. In 2022, various regions in China experienced additional waves of COVID-19 outbreaks for which the government chose to reinstate lockdown measures. As a result, China\u2019s 2022 GDP growth target of around 5.5% was missed as the country\u2019s GDP grew by 3%. Towards the end of 2022, the Chinese government began its pivot from its restrictive COVID policies and during the first quarter of 2023 China abandoned its \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy and began to reopen. For 2023, the Chinese government has established a GDP growth target of around 5% while implementing various stimulus measures and pro-growth policies. However, the outlook for China and any impact on the global economy is uncertain, and our financial condition and results of operations, as well as our future prospects, could be impeded by an economic downturn in China.\n\u200b\nGovernments may also turn to trade barriers to protect their domestic industries against foreign imports, thereby depressing shipping demand. In particular, leaders in the \u00a0United States have indicated the United States may seek to implement more protective trade measures. There is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States, China, and other exporting countries, including with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations, and tariffs. Protectionist developments, or the perception that they may occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions, and may significantly reduce global trade. Moreover, increasing trade protectionism may cause an increase in (i) the cost of goods exported from regions globally, particularly from the Asia-Pacific region, (ii) the length of time required to transport commodities and (iii) the risks associated with exporting commodities. A decrease in the level of imports to and exports from China could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\u200b\nProspective investors should consider the potential impact, uncertainty and risk associated with the development in the wider global economy. Further economic downturn in any of these countries could have a material effect on our future performance, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur business may be affected by macroeconomic conditions, including rising inflation, higher interest rates, market volatility, economic uncertainty, and global supply chain constraints.\n\u200b\nVarious macroeconomic factors, including rising inflation, higher interest rates, global supply chain constraints, and the effects of overall economic conditions and uncertainties such as those resulting from the current and future conditions in the global financial markets, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Significant increases in inflation and interest rates may negatively impact us by increasing our operating costs and our cost of borrowing. Interest rates, the liquidity of the credit markets and the volatility of the capital markets could also affect the operation of our business and our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all.\n\u200b\nThe state of global financial markets and general economic conditions, as well as the perceived impact of emissions\nby our vessels on the climate may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing or refinance our credit facility on acceptable terms, which may hinder or prevent us from operating or expanding our business.\n\u200b\nGlobal financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile, which might adversely impact our ability to issue additional equity at prices that will not be dilutive to our existing shareholders or preclude us from issuing equity at all. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\n\u200b\nAlso, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally, and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the availability and cost of obtaining money from the public and private equity and debt markets has become more difficult. Many lenders have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to current debt, and reduced, and in some cases ceased, to provide funding to borrowers and other market participants, including equity and debt investors, and some have been unwilling to invest on attractive terms or even at all. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that financing will be available if needed and to the extent required, or that we will be able to refinance our existing and future credit facilities, on acceptable terms or at all. If financing or refinancing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to enhance our existing business, complete additional vessel acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.\n\u200b\nIn 2019, a number of leading lenders to the shipping industry and other industry participants announced a global framework by which financial institutions can assess the climate alignment of their ship finance portfolios, called the Poseidon Principles, and additional lenders have subsequently announced their intention to adhere to such principles. If the ships in our fleet are deemed not to satisfy the emissions and other sustainability standards contemplated by the Poseidon Principles, the availability and cost of bank financing for such vessels may be adversely affected. \n\u200b\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could affect our operating results and the amount of available cash with which we can pay dividends or repurchase our common stock . \n\u200b\nLiquefied gases are primarily used for industrial and domestic heating, as a chemical and refinery feedstock, as a transportation fuel and in agriculture. The LPG shipping market historically has been stronger in the spring and summer months in anticipation of increased consumption of propane and butane for heating during the winter months. In addition, unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and the supply of certain commodities. Demand for our vessels therefore may be stronger in the quarters ending June 30 and September 30 and relatively weaker during the quarters ending December 31 and March 31, although 12-month time charter rates tend to smooth these short-term fluctuations and recent LPG shipping market activity has not yielded the expected seasonal results. The increase in petrochemical industry buying has contributed to less marked seasonality than in the past, but there can no guarantee that this trend will continue. To the extent any of our time charters expire during the typically weaker fiscal quarters ending December 31 and March 31, it may not be possible to re-charter our vessels at similar rates. As a result, we may have to accept lower rates or experience off-hire time for our vessels, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\u200b\n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFuture technological innovation could reduce our charter hire income and the value of our vessels.\n\u200b\nThe charter hire rates and the value and operational life of a vessel are determined by a number of factors including the vessel's efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency includes speed, fuel type and economy and the ability to load and discharge cargo quickly. Flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors, utilize related docking facilities and pass through canals and straits. The length of a vessel's physical life is related to its original design and construction, its maintenance and the impact of the stress of operations. We believe that our fleet is among the youngest and most eco\n-\nfriendly fleet of all our competitors. However, if new LPG carriers are built that are more efficient and environmentally friendly or more flexible or have longer physical lives than our vessels, competition from these more technologically advanced vessels could adversely affect the amount of charter hire payments we receive for our vessels and the resale value of our vessels could significantly decrease. Similarly, if the vessels of the other participants in the Helios Pool fleet become outdated, the amount of charter hire payments to the Helios Pool may be adversely affected. As a result of the foregoing, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. \n\u200b\nChanges in fuel, or bunker, prices may adversely affect profits.\n\u200b\nWhile we do not bear the cost of fuel, or bunkers, under time charters, including for our vessels employed on time charters through the Helios Pool, fuel is a significant expense in our shipping operations when vessels are off-hire or deployed under spot charters. The cost of fuel can also be an important factor considered by charterers in negotiating charter rates. Therefore, changes in the price of fuel may adversely affect our profitability. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. \n\u200b\nFurthermore, fuel may become significantly more expensive in the future, which may reduce our profitability. In addition, the entry into force, on January 1, 2020, of the 0.5% global sulfur cap in marine fuels used by vessels that are not equipped with sulfur oxide (\u201cSOx\u201d) exhaust gas cleaning systems (\u201cscrubbers\u201d) under the International Convention for Prevention of Pollution from Ships (\u201cMARPOL\u201d) Annex VI may lead to changes in the production quantities and prices of different grades of marine fuel by refineries and introduces an additional element of uncertainty in fuel markets, which could result in additional costs and adversely affect our cash flows, earnings and results from operations.\n\u200b\nWe are subject to regulations and liabilities, including environmental laws, which could require significant expenditures and adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations. \n\u200b\nOur business and the operation of our VLGCs are subject to complex laws and regulations and materially affected by government regulation, including environmental regulations in the form of international conventions and national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which our corporate offices are located, as well as in the country or countries in which the vessels operate, as well as in the respective country of their registration.\n\u200b\nThese regulations include, but are not limited to US-OPA 90, which establishes an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills and applies to any discharges of oil from a vessel, including discharges of fuel oil and lubricants, the CAA, the CWA, and requirements of the USCG and the EPA, and the MTSA, and regulations of the IMO, including MARPOL, the Bunker Convention, the IMO International Convention of Load Lines of 1966, as from time to time amended, and the SOLAS Convention. To comply with these and other regulations we may be required to incur additional costs to modify our vessels, meet new operating maintenance and inspection requirements, develop contingency plans for potential spills, and obtain insurance coverage. We are also required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain permits, licenses, certificates and financial assurances with respect to our corporate and ships\u2019 operations. These permits, licenses, certificates and financial assurances may be issued or renewed with terms that could materially and adversely affect our operations. Because these laws and regulations are often revised, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with them or the impact they may have on the resale prices or useful lives of our vessels. However, a failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations. Additional laws and regulations may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase the cost of our \n50\n\n\nTable of Contents\ndoing business and which could materially adversely affect our operations. For example, a future serious incident, such as the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, may result in new regulatory initiatives.\n \n\u200b\nThe operation of our vessels is affected by the requirements set forth in the ISM Code. The ISM Code requires ship owners and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive \u201cSafety Management System\u201d that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for safe operation and describing procedures for dealing with emergencies. The failure of a ship owner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject the owner or charterer to increased liability, may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels, or may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. Non-compliance with the ISM Code may result in breach of our loan covenants. Currently, each of the vessels in our fleet is ISM Code certified. Because these certifications are critical to our business, we place a high priority on maintaining them. Nonetheless, there is the possibility that such certifications may not be renewed.\n\u200b\nWe currently maintain, for each of our vessels, pollution liability insurance coverage in the amount of $1.0 billion per incident. In addition, we carry hull and machinery and protection and indemnity insurance to cover the risks of fire and explosion. Under certain circumstances, fire and explosion could result in a catastrophic loss. We believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate, but not all risks can be insured, and there is the possibility that any specific claim may not be paid, or that we will not always be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates. If the damages from a catastrophic spill exceeded our insurance coverage, the effect on our business would be severe and could possibly result in our insolvency.\n\u200b\nRecent action by the IMO\u2019s Maritime Safety Committee and United States agencies indicates that cybersecurity regulations for the maritime industry are likely to be further developed in the near future in an attempt to combat cybersecurity threats. For example, by IMO resolution, administrations are encouraged to ensure that cyber-risk management systems are incorporated by ship-owners and managers by their first annual Document of Compliance audit after January 1, 2021. This might cause companies to create additional procedures for monitoring cybersecurity, which could require additional expenses and/or capital expenditures. However, the impact of such regulations is hard to predict at this time.\n\u200b\nThe IMO has imposed updated guidelines for ballast water management systems specifying the maximum amount of viable organisms allowed to be discharged from a vessel\u2019s ballast water. Depending on the date of the IOPP renewal survey, existing vessels constructed before September 8, 2017 must comply with the updated D-2 standard on or after September 8, 2019. For most vessels, compliance with the D-2 standard will involve installing on-board systems to treat ballast water and eliminate unwanted organisms. Ships constructed on or after September 8, 2017 are to comply with the D-2 standards on or after September 8, 2017. All of our VLGCs are in compliance with the updated guidelines.\n\u200b\nFurthermore, United States regulations are currently changing. Although the 2013 Vessel General Permit VGP program and NISA are currently in effect to regulate ballast discharge, exchange and installation, the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act VIDA, which was signed into law on December 4, 2018, requires that the EPA develop national standards of performance for approximately 30 discharges, similar to those found in the VGP within two years. On October 26, 2020, the EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Vessel Incidental Discharge National Standards of Performance under VIDA. Within two years after the EPA publishes its final Vessel Incidental Discharge National Standards of Performance, the U.S. Coast Guard must develop corresponding implementation, compliance and enforcement regulations regarding ballast water. The new regulations could require the installation of new equipment, which may cause us to incur substantial costs.\n\u200b\nWe believe that regulation of the shipping industry will continue to become more stringent and compliance with such new regulations will be more expensive for us and our competitors. Substantial violations of applicable requirements or a catastrophic release from one of our vessels could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u200b\n51\n\n\nTable of Contents\nClimate change and greenhouse gas restrictions may adversely impact our operations and markets.\nDue to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries and the IMO have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures may include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Compliance with changes in laws, regulations and obligations relating to climate change could increase our costs related to operating and maintaining our vessels and require us to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. Revenue generation and strategic growth opportunities could also be adversely affected by compliance with such changes. Additionally, increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may incentivize use of alternative energy sources. Unless and until such regulations are implemented and their effects are known, we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate their impact on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to compete. However, any long-term material adverse effect on the LPG industry may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u200b\nWe operate globally, including in countries, states and regions where our businesses, and the activities of our consumer customers, could be negatively impacted by climate change. Climate change presents both immediate and long-term risks to us and our customers, with the risks expected to increase over time. Climate risks can arise from physical risks (acute or chronic risks related to the physical effects of climate change) and transition risks (risks related to regulatory and legal, technological, market and reputational changes from a transition to a low-carbon economy). Physical risks could damage or destroy our or our customers\u2019 and clients\u2019 properties and other assets and disrupt our or their operations. For example, climate change may lead to more extreme weather events occurring more often which may result in physical damage and additional volatility within our business operations and potential counterparty exposures and other financial risks. Transition risks may result in changes in regulations or market preferences, which in turn could have negative impacts on our results of operation or the reputation of us and our customers. For example, carbon-intensive industries like LPG are exposed to climate risks, such as those risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, as well as low-carbon industries that may be subject to risks associated with new technologies. Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs.\n\u200b\nIf our vessels call on ports located in countries or territories that are subject to sanctions or embargoes imposed by the United States or other authorities, it could lead to monetary fines or penalties and/or adversely affect our reputation and the market for our common shares. \n\u200b\nNone of our vessels have called on ports located in countries or territories subject to country-wide or territory-wide sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government or other applicable governmental authorities (\u201cSanctioned Jurisdictions\u201d) in violation of applicable sanctions laws. Although we do not expect that our vessels will call on ports located in Sanctioned Jurisdictions and we endeavor to take precautions reasonably designed to mitigate such activities, including relevant trade exclusion clauses in our charter contracts forbidding the use of our vessels in trade that would be in violation economic sanctions, it is possible that on charterers\u2019 instructions, and without our consent, our vessels may call on ports located in such countries or territories in the future. If such activities result in a sanctions violation, we could be subject to monetary fines, penalties, or other sanctions, and our reputation and the market for our common shares could be adversely affected. \n\u200b\nThe laws and regulations imposed by the United States and other governmental jurisdictions vary in their application, and do not all apply to the same covered persons or proscribe the same activities. In addition, the sanctions and embargo laws and regulations of each jurisdiction may be amended to increase or reduce the restrictions they impose over time, and the lists of persons and entities designated under these laws and regulations are amended frequently. Moreover, most sanctions regimes provide that entities owned or controlled by the persons or entities designated in such lists are also subject to sanctions. The United States and EU both have enacted new sanctions programs in recent years. Additional countries or territories, as well as additional persons or entities within or affiliated with those countries or territories, have, and in the future will, become the target of sanctions. These require us to be diligent in ensuring our compliance with sanctions laws. Further, the United States has increased its focus on sanctions enforcement with respect to the shipping sector. Current or future counterparties of ours may be or become affiliated with persons or entities that \n52\n\n\nTable of Contents\nare now or may in the future be the subject of sanctions imposed by the United States Government, the European Union, and/or other international bodies. If we determine that such sanctions or embargoes require us to terminate existing or future contracts to which we or our subsidiaries are party or if we are found to be in violation of such applicable sanctions or embargoes, we could face monetary fines, we may suffer reputational harm and our results of operations may be adversely affected. \n\u200b\nAs a result of Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine, the United States, EU and United Kingdom, together with numerous other countries, have imposed significant sanctions on persons and entities associated with Russia and Belarus, as well as comprehensive sanctions on certain areas within the Donbas region of Ukraine, and such sanctions apply to entities owned or controlled by such designated persons or entities. These sanctions adversely affect our ability to operate in the region and also restrict parties whose cargo we may carry. Sanctions against Russia have also placed significant prohibitions on the maritime transportation of seaborne Russian oil, the importation of certain Russian energy products and other goods, and new investments in the Russian Federation. These sanctions further limit the scope of permissible operations and cargo we may carry.\n\u200b\nBeginning in February of 2022, President Biden and several European leaders announced various economic sanctions against Russia in connection with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which may adversely impact our business, given Russia\u2019s role as a major global exporter of crude oil and natural gas. Both the EU as well as the United States have implemented sanction programs, which includes prohibitions on the import of certain Russian energy products into the United States, including crude oil, petroleum, petroleum fuels, oils, liquefied natural gas and coal, as well as prohibitions on new investments in Russia, among other restrictions. Furthermore, the EU and the United States have also prohibited a variety of specified services related to the maritime transport of Russian Federation origin crude oil and petroleum products, including trading/commodities brokering, financing, shipping, insurance (including reinsurance and protection and indemnity), flagging, and customs brokering. These prohibitions took effect on December 5, 2022 with respect to the maritime transport of crude oil and took effect on February 5, 2023 with respect to the maritime transport of other petroleum products. An exception exists to permit such services when the price of the seaborne Russian oil does not exceed the relevant price cap; but implementation of this price exception relies on a recordkeeping and attestation process that allows each party in the supply chain of seaborne Russian oil to demonstrate or confirm that oil has been purchased at or below the price cap. Violations of the price cap policy or the risk that information, documentation, or attestations provided by parties in the supply chain are later determined to be false may pose additional risks adversely affecting our business.\n\u200b\nAlthough we believe that we have been in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations in 2022, and intend to maintain such compliance, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation could result in reputational damages, fines, penalties or other sanctions that could severely impact our ability to access U.S. capital markets and conduct our business and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in us. \n\u200b\nOur vessels are subject to periodic inspections.\n\u200b\nThe hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and SOLAS. Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage and lending that a vessel be certified \u201cin class\u201d by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies, the IACS. The IACS has adopted harmonized Common Structural Rules, or \u201cthe Rules,\u201d which apply to oil tankers and bulk carriers contracted for construction on or after July 1, 2015. The Rules attempt to create a level of consistency between IACS Societies. Our technically-managed VLGCs are currently classed with either Lloyd's Register, ABS or Det Norske Veritas. \n\u200b\nA vessel must undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys, drydockings, and special surveys. In lieu of a special survey, a vessel's machinery may be on a continuous survey cycle, under which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. Our vessels are on special survey cycles for hull inspection and continuous survey cycles for machinery inspection. Every vessel is also required to be drydocked every 30 to 36 months for inspection of the underwater parts of such vessel. However, for vessels not exceeding 15 years that have means to facilitate underwater \n53\n\n\nTable of Contents\ninspection in lieu of drydocking, the drydocking can be skipped and be conducted concurrently with the special survey. Certain cargo vessels that meet the system requirements set by classification societies may qualify for extended drydocking, which extends the 5-year period to 7.5 years, by replacing certain dry-dockings with in-water surveys.\n\u200b\nOur vessels also undergo inspections with a view towards compliance under the SIRE and USCG requirements, as applicable. If a vessel does not maintain its class and/or fails any annual survey, intermediate survey, dry-docking, or special survey, the vessel will be unable to carry cargo between ports and will be unemployable and uninsurable, which would cause us to be in violation of covenants in our loan agreements and insurance contracts or other financing arrangements. This would adversely impact our operations and revenues. \n\u200b\nMaritime claimants could arrest our vessels, which could interrupt our cash flow.\n\u200b\nCrew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and others may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting or attaching a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could interrupt our cash flow and require us to pay large sums of funds to have the arrest lifted.\n\u200b\nIn addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the \"sister ship\" theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel which is subject to the claimant's maritime lien and any \"associated\" vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert \"sister ship\" liability against one vessel in our fleet for claims relating to another of our ships or, possibly, another vessel managed by one of our shareholders holding more than 5% of our common shares or entities affiliated with them.\n\u200b\nGovernments could requisition our vessels during a period of war or emergency, resulting in loss of revenues.\n\u200b\nThe government of a vessel's registry could requisition for title or seize our vessels. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the owner. A government could also requisition our vessels for hire. Requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency. Government requisition of one or more of our vessels could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\u200b\nThe operation of ocean-going vessels is inherently risky, and an incident resulting in significant loss or environmental consequences involving any of our vessels could harm our reputation and business.\n\u200b\nThe operation of an ocean-going vessel carries inherent risks. Our vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as marine disasters, bad weather, mechanical failures, grounding, fire, explosions, collisions, human error, war, terrorism, piracy, cargo loss, latent defects, acts of God and other circumstances or events. Changing economic, regulatory and political conditions in some countries, including political and military conflicts, have from time to time resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways, piracy, terrorism, labor strikes and boycotts. Damage to the environment could also result from our operations, particularly through spillage of fuel, lubricants or other chemicals and substances used in operations, or extensive uncontrolled fires. These hazards may result in death or injury to persons, loss of revenues or property, environmental damage, higher insurance rates, damage to our customer relationships, market disruptions, delay or rerouting, any of which may also subject us to litigation. As a result, we could be exposed to substantial liabilities not recoverable under our insurances. Further, the involvement of our vessels in a serious accident could harm our reputation as a safe and reliable vessel operator and lead to a loss of business.\nIf our vessels suffer damage, they may need to be repaired at a drydocking facility and in certain instances such damage may result in lost revenues under and in certain cases the termination of the employment contract under which such vessel is operating. The costs of drydock repairs are unpredictable and may be substantial. We may have to pay drydocking costs that our insurance does not cover at all or in full. The loss of earnings while these vessels are being repaired and repositioned, as well as the actual cost of these repairs, may adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, space at drydocking facilities is sometimes limited and not all drydocking facilities are conveniently located. We may be unable to find space at a suitable drydocking facility or our vessels may be forced to travel to a \n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\ndrydocking facility that is not conveniently located to our vessels' positions. The loss of earnings while these vessels are forced to wait for space or to travel or be towed to more distant drydocking facilities may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u200b\nWe may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\u200b\nWe are currently not involved in any litigation matters that are expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Nevertheless, we anticipate that we could be involved in litigation matters from time to time in the future. The operating hazards inherent in our business expose us to litigation, including personal injury litigation, environmental litigation, contractual litigation with clients, intellectual property litigation, tax or securities litigation, and maritime lawsuits including the possible arrest of our vessels. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter. Any future litigation may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay dividends, because of potential negative outcomes, the costs associated with prosecuting or defending such lawsuits, and the diversion of management's attention to these matters. Additionally, our insurance may not be applicable or sufficient to cover the related costs in all cases or our insurers may not remain solvent.\n\u200b\nActs of piracy on ocean\n-\ngoing vessels could adversely affect our business.\n\u200b\nActs of piracy have historically affected ocean-going vessels. At present, most piracy and armed robbery incidents are recurrent in the Gulf of Aden region off the coast of Somalia, South China Sea, Sulu Sea and Celebes Sea and in particular the Gulf of Guinea region off Nigeria, which experienced increased incidents of piracy in 2019. Sea piracy incidents continue to occur. If these piracy attacks occur in regions in which our vessels are deployed and are characterized by insurers as \u201cwar risk\u201d zones or Joint War Committee \u201cwar and strikes\u201d listed areas, premiums payable for such coverage, for which we are responsible with respect to vessels employed on spot charters, but not vessels employed on bareboat or time charters, could increase significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain. In addition, costs to employ onboard security guards could increase in such circumstances. We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, detention hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against our vessels, or an increase in cost, or unavailability of insurance for our vessels, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u200b\nOur operations outside the United States expose us to global risks, such as political instability, terrorism, war, international hostilities and public health concerns, which may interfere with the operation of our vessels and have a material adverse impact on our operating results, revenues and costs.\n\u200b\nWe are an international company and primarily conduct our operations outside the United States. Changing economic, political and governmental conditions in the countries where we are engaged in business or where our vessels are registered affect us. In the past, political conflicts have resulted in attacks on vessels or other petroleum-related infrastructures, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt shipping. Continuing conflicts, instability and other recent developments in the Middle East and elsewhere, may lead to additional acts of terrorism or armed conflict around the world, and our vessels may face higher risks of being attacked or detained, or shipping routes transited by our vessels, such as the Strait of Hormuz, may be otherwise disrupted. In addition, future hostilities or other political instability in regions where our vessels trade could affect our trade patterns and adversely affect our operations and performance, including the recent conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Recent developments in the Ukraine region and continuing conflicts in the Middle East may lead to additional armed conflicts around the world, which may contribute to further economic instability in the global financial markets and international commerce. Additionally, any escalations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and Russia could result in retaliation from Russia that could potentially affect the shipping industry. \n\u200b\nIn February of 2022, President Biden and several European leaders also announced various economic sanctions against Russia in connection with the aforementioned conflicts in the Ukraine region, which have continued to expand over the past year and may adversely impact our business, given Russia\u2019s role as a major global exporter of crude oil and natural gas. The Russian Foreign Harmful Activities Sanctions program includes prohibitions on the import of certain Russian energy products into the United States, including crude oil, petroleum, petroleum fuels, oils, liquefied natural gas \n55\n\n\nTable of Contents\nand coal, as well as prohibitions on all new investments in Russia by U.S. persons, among other restrictions. Furthermore, the United States has also prohibited a variety of specified services related to the maritime transport of Russian Federation origin crude oil and petroleum products, including trading/commodities brokering, financing, shipping, insurance (including reinsurance and protection and indemnity), flagging, and customs brokering. These prohibitions took effect on December 5, 2022 with respect to the maritime transport of crude oil and are scheduled to take effect on February 5, 2023 with respect to the maritime transport of other petroleum products. An exception exists to permit such services when the price of the seaborne Russian oil does not exceed the relevant price cap; but implementation of this price exception relies on a recordkeeping and attestation process that allows each party in the supply chain of seaborne Russian oil to demonstrate or confirm that oil has been purchased at or below the price cap. Violations of the price cap policy or the risk that information, documentation, or attestations provided by parties in the supply chain are later determined to be false may pose additional risks adversely affecting our business.\n\u200b\nFurther hostilities in or closure of major waterways in the Middle East, Black Sea, or South China Sea region could adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products, as well as LPG, and negatively affect our investment and our customers' investment decisions over an extended period of time. In addition, sanctions against oil exporting countries such as Iran, Russia, Sudan and Syria may also impact the availability of crude oil, petroleum products and LPG would increase the availability of applicable vessels thereby negatively impacting charter rates. \n\u200b\nTerrorist attacks, or the perception that LPG or natural gas facilities or oil refineries and LPG carriers are potential terrorist targets, could materially and adversely affect the continued supply of LPG. Concern that LPG and natural gas facilities may be targeted for attack by terrorists has contributed to a significant community and environmental resistance to the construction of a number of natural gas facilities, primarily in North America. If a terrorist incident involving a gas facility or gas carrier did occur, the incident may adversely affect necessary LPG facilities or natural gas facilities currently in operation. Furthermore, future terrorist attacks could result in increased volatility of the financial markets in the United States and globally and could result in an economic recession in the United States or the world.\n\u200b\nIn addition, public health threats, such as the coronavirus, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate could adversely impact our operations, and the operations of our customers.\n\u200b\nAny of these occurrences and related consequences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, revenues and costs.\n\u200b\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and resulting sanctions by the United States, European Union and other countries have contributed to inflation, market disruptions and increased volatility in commodity prices in the United States and a slowdown in global economic growth.\n\u200b\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian troops began a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. In response to the attacks on Ukraine, sanctions and other penalties have been levied by the United States, European Union, and other countries and additional sanctions and penalties have been proposed. The invasion by Russia and resulting sanctions have had a broad range of adverse impacts on global business and financial markets some of which have had and may continue to have adverse impacts on our business. These include increased inflation, significant market disruptions and increased volatility in commodity prices such as oil and natural gas. Although the duration and extent of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, and the magnitude of the potential economic impact is currently unknown, Russian military actions and resulting sanctions could have a negative effect on our financial condition and operating results even though we do not conduct any business directly in Ukraine or Russia.\n\u200b\nOutbreaks of epidemic and pandemic diseases, such as COVID-19, and governmental responses thereto could adversely affect our business.\n\u200b\nOur operations are subject to risks related to pandemics, epidemics or other infectious disease outbreaks, including COVID-19, which was initially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) on March 11, 2020 and was declared no longer a global health emergency on May 5, 2023. Government efforts to combat the COVID-\n56\n\n\nTable of Contents\n19 pandemic, including the enactment or imposition of travel bans, quarantines and other emergency public health measures, have negatively affected economic conditions, supply chains, labor markets, demand for certain shipped goods both regionally and globally, and have also negatively impacted and may continue to impact our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers. Although demand for shipping and transportation services continued to rebound during 2022 as restrictive public health measures were substantially curtailed or eliminated, we still experienced increases in crew wages and related costs, particularly in crew travel and medical costs and certain spares and stores and associated transport costs due to COVID-19. Further, although the WHO declared the pandemic was no longer a public health emergency on May 5, 2023, future developments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergencies, and their impact on the global economy the oil and natural gas transportation industry remain highly uncertain.\n\u200b\nThe extent to which our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected by COVID-19 or future pandemics, epidemics or other outbreaks of infectious diseases is highly uncertain and will depend on numerous evolving factors that we cannot predict, including, but not limited to (i) the duration and severity of the infectious disease outbreak; (ii) the imposition of restrictive measures to combat the outbreak and slow disease transmission; (iii) the introduction of financial support measures to reduce the impact of the outbreak on the economy; (iv) volatility in the demand for and price of oil and gas; (v) shortages or reductions in the supply of essential goods, services or labor; and (vi) fluctuations in general economic or financial conditions tied to the outbreak, such as a sharp increase in interest rates or reduction in the availability of credit. We cannot predict the effect that an outbreak of a new COVID-19 variant or strain, or any future infectious disease outbreak, pandemic or epidemic may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition, which could be material and adverse.\n\u200b\nOrganizations across industries, including ours, are rightly focusing on their employees\u2019 well-being, whilst making sure that their operations continue undisrupted and at the same time, adapting to the new ways of operating. As such employees are encouraged or even required to operate remotely which significantly increases the risk of cybersecurity attacks, although we take many precautions to mitigate such risks.\n\u200b\nIf labor or other interruptions are not resolved in a timely manner, such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\u200b\nWe employ masters, officers and crews to man our vessels. If not resolved in a timely and cost-effective manner, industrial action or other labor unrest or any other interruption arising from incidents of whistleblowing whether proven or not, could prevent or hinder our operations from being carried out as we expect and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\u200b\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches, including as a result of cybersecurity attacks, could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition, subject us to increased operating costs, and expose us to litigation.\n\u200b\nWe rely on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations, including on our vessels. Despite our implementation of security and back-up measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, operational error, or other catastrophic events. Our technology systems are also subject to cybersecurity attacks including malware, other malicious software, phishing email attacks, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data, the unauthorized release, corruption or loss of our data, loss or damage to our data delivery systems, and other electronic security breaches. In addition, as we continue to grow the volume of transactions in our businesses, our existing IT systems infrastructure, applications and related functionality may be unable to effectively support a larger scale operation, which can cause the information being processed to be unreliable and impact our decision-making or damage our reputation with customers.\n\u200b\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and prevent future cybersecurity attacks, it is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, especially because such attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including persons involved in organized crime or associated with external service providers. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or use electronic means to induce the company to enter into fraudulent transactions. A successful cyber-attack could materially disrupt our operations, including the safety of our \n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nvessel operations. Past and future occurrences of such attacks could damage our reputation and our ability to conduct our business, impact our credit and risk exposure decisions, cause us to lose customers or revenues, subject us to litigation and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these issues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u200b\nFurther, data protection laws apply to us in certain countries in which we do business. Specifically, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which was applicable beginning May 2018, increases penalties up to a maximum of 4% of global annual turnover for breach of the regulation. The GDPR requires mandatory breach notification, the standard for which is also followed outside the EU (particularly in Asia). Non-compliance with data protection laws could expose us to regulatory investigations, which could result in fines and penalties. In addition to imposing fines, regulators may also issue orders to stop processing personal data, which could disrupt operations. We could also be subject to litigation from persons or corporations allegedly affected by data protection violations. Violation of data protection laws is a criminal offence in some countries, and individuals can be imprisoned or fined. Any violation of these laws or harm to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\u200b\nMoreover, cyber-attacks against the Ukrainian government and other countries in the region have been reported in connection with the recent conflict between Russia and Ukraine. To the extent such attacks have collateral effects on global critical infrastructure or financial institutions, such developments could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. At this time, it is difficult to assess the likelihood of such a threat and any potential impact at this time.\n\u200b\nA cyber-attack could materially disrupt our business.\n\u200b\nOur business operations could be targeted by individuals or groups seeking to sabotage or disrupt our information technology systems and networks, or to steal data. A successful cyber-attack could materially disrupt our operations, including the safety of our operations, or lead to unauthorized release of information or alteration of information on our systems. Any such attack or other breach of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u200b\nRisks Relating to Our Common Shares\n\u200b\nThe price of our common shares has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future, and as a result, investors in our common shares could incur substantial losses.\n\u200b\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future without any discernable announcements or developments by the company or third parties to substantiate the movement of our stock price. Our stock prices may experience rapid and substantial decreases or increases in the foreseeable future that are unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In addition, the ongoing impact of COVID-19 has caused broad stock market and industry fluctuations. The stock market in general and the market for shipping companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience substantial losses on their investment in our common shares. The market price for our common shares may be influenced by many factors, including the following:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\ninvestor reaction to our business strategy;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nour continued compliance with the listing standards of the NYSE;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, especially changes in laws or regulations applicable to our industry;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nour ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n\u200b\n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\ndeclines in the market prices of stocks generally;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\ntrading volume of our common shares;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nsales of our common shares by us or our stockholders;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nother events or factors, including those resulting from such events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues including health epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse weather and climate conditions could disrupt our operations or result in political or economic instability.\n\u200b\nThese broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common shares, regardless of our operating performance, and may be inconsistent with any improvements in actual or expected operating performance, financial condition or other indicators of value. Since the stock price of our common shares has fluctuated in the past, has been recently volatile and may be volatile in the future, investors in our common shares could incur substantial losses. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that our stock price will remain at current prices.\n\u200b\nAdditionally, securities of certain companies have experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due to short sellers of shares of common shares, known as a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d. These short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in those companies and in the market and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment as the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. While we have no reason to believe our shares would be the target of a short squeeze, there can be no assurance that we will not be in the future, and you may lose a significant portion or all of your investment if you purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.\n\u200b\nAlthough we have initiated a stock repurchase program, we cannot assure you that we will continue to repurchase shares or that we will\u00a0repurchase shares at favorable prices.\n\u200b\nOn February 2, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0\u00a0million of our common shares (the \u201c2022 Common Share Repurchase Authority\u201d). Under the authorization, when in force, purchases may be made at our discretion in the form of open market repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or a combination of these methods. The actual amount and timing of share repurchases are subject to capital availability, our determination that share repurchases are in the best interest of our shareholders, and market conditions.\u00a0We are not obligated to make any common share repurchases. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have repurchased 0.1 million aggregate amount of our common shares under the 2022 Common Share Repurchase Authority at an average price of $15.00 per share.\n\u200b\nOur ability to repurchase shares will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic investments, our results of operations, our financial condition, and other factors beyond our control that we may deem relevant. A reduction in repurchases, or the completion of our stock repurchase program, could have a negative impact on our stock price. Additionally, price volatility of our common shares over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our common shares to exceed the stock\u2019s market price at a given point in time. Conversely, repurchases of our common shares could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our common shares and will diminish our cash reserves. As such, we can provide no assurance that we will repurchase shares at favorable prices, if at all. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of our common share repurchase authorities.\n \n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe paid four irregular dividends in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 and have declared one irregular dividend to be paid in our fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, but we may be unable to pay dividends in the future. \n\u200b\nOn May 4, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an irregular cash dividend of $2.50 per share of our common stock to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 16, 2022, totaling $100.3 million. We paid $99.7 million on June 2, 2022 with the remaining $0.6 million deferred until certain shares of restricted stock vest.\n\u200b\nOn August 3, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an irregular cash dividend of $1.00 per share of the Company\u2019s common stock to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 15, 2022, totaling $40.3 million. We paid $40.1 million on September 2, 2022 and the remaining $0.2 million is deferred until certain shares of restricted stock vest.\n\u200b\nOn October 27, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an irregular cash dividend of $1.00\u00a0per share of the Company\u2019s common stock to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 7, 2022, totaling $40.4\u00a0million. We paid $40.1 million on December 6, 2022 and the remaining $0.3 million is deferred until certain shares of restricted stock vest.\n\u200b\nOn February 1, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an irregular cash dividend of $1.00 per share of the Company\u2019s common stock to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 15, 2023, totaling $40.4 million. We paid $40.1 million on February 28, 2023 and the remaining $0.3\u00a0million is deferred until certain shares of restricted stock vest.\n\u200b\nOn April 26, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors has declared an irregular cash dividend of $1.00 per share of the Company\u2019s common stock to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 8, 2023, totaling $40.4 million. We paid $40.1 million on May 22, 2023 and the remaining $0.3\u00a0million is deferred until certain shares of restricted stock vest.\n\u200b\nThese were irregular dividends and may not be indicative of future dividend payments. In general, the terms of our credit facility do not permit us to pay dividends if there is, or the payment of the dividend would result in, an event of default or a breach of a loan covenant.\n\u200b\nWe will evaluate the potential level and timing of any future dividends as profits and cash flows allow. However, the timing and amount of any dividend payments will always be subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, earnings, capital expenditure commitments, market prospects, investment opportunities, the provisions of Marshall Islands law affecting the payment of distributions to shareholders, and the terms and restrictions of our \nexisting and future\n \ncredit facilities. The LPG shipping industry is highly volatile, and we cannot predict with certainty the amount of cash, if any, that will be available for distribution as dividends in any period. Also, there may be a high degree of variability from period to period in the amount of cash that is available for the payment of dividends.\n\u200b\nWe may incur expenses or liabilities or be subject to other circumstances in the future that reduce or eliminate the amount of cash that we have available for distribution as dividends, including as a result of the risks described herein. Our growth strategy contemplates that we will primarily finance our acquisitions of additional vessels through debt financings or the net proceeds of future equity issuances on terms acceptable to us. If financing is not available to us on acceptable terms, our board of directors may determine to finance or refinance acquisitions with cash from operations, which would reduce the amount of any cash available for the payment of dividends.\n\u200b\nThe Republic of Marshall Islands laws also generally prohibit the payment of dividends other than from surplus (retained earnings and the excess of consideration received for the sale of shares above the par value of the shares) or while a company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent by the payment of such a dividend. We may not have sufficient surplus in the future to pay dividends and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient funds or surplus to make distributions to us. We can give no assurance that future dividends will be paid at any level or at all.\n\u200b\n60\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe are a holding company and depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us in order to satisfy our financial obligations and to make dividend payments.\n\u200b\nWe are a holding company and our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating assets. As a result, our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and to pay dividends, if any, to our shareholders depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate profits available for distribution to us. The ability of a subsidiary to make these distributions could be affected by a claim or other action by a third party, including a creditor, the terms of our financing arrangements or by the law of its jurisdiction of incorporation which regulates the payment of dividends. \n\u200b\nWe may issue additional shares in the future, which could cause the market price of our common shares to decline.\n\u200b\nWe may issue additional common shares in the future without shareholder approval, in a number of circumstances, including in connection with, among other things, future vessel acquisitions or repayment of outstanding indebtedness. Our issuance of additional shares would have the following effects: our existing shareholders' proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease; the amount of cash available for dividends payable per share may decrease; the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding share may be diminished; and the market price of our shares may decline.\n\u200b\nA future sale of shares by major shareholders may reduce the share price.\n\u200b\nAs of the date of this report and based on information contained in documents publicly filed by John C. Hadjipateras, he beneficially owns an aggregate of 5.5 million common shares, or approximately 13.7% of our outstanding common shares, and two other major shareholders own approximately 20.6% of our outstanding common shares. Sales or the possibility of sales of substantial amounts of our common shares by any of our major shareholders could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\n\u200b\nWe are incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well\n-\ndeveloped body of corporate law.\n\u200b\nWe are incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well-developed body of corporate or case law. As a result, shareholders may have fewer rights and protections under Marshall Islands law than under a typical jurisdiction in the United States. Our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act, or BCA. The provisions of the BCA resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the United States. However, there have been few judicial cases in the Republic of the Marshall Islands interpreting the BCA. The rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under the law of the Republic of the Marshall Islands are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain United States jurisdictions. Shareholder rights may differ as well. While the BCA does specifically incorporate the non-statutory law, or judicial case law, of the State of Delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions, we cannot predict whether Marshall Islands courts would reach the same conclusions as United States courts. Therefore, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions by the management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a United States jurisdiction.\n\u200b\nIt may be difficult to enforce a United States judgment against us, our officers and our directors because we are a foreign corporation.\n\u200b\nWe are incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands and most of our subsidiaries are organized in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries are located outside the United States. As a result, our shareholders should not assume that courts in the countries in which we or our subsidiaries are incorporated or where our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries are located (1) would enforce judgments of United States courts obtained in actions against us or our subsidiaries based upon the civil liability provisions of applicable United States federal and state securities laws or (2) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against us or our subsidiaries based upon these laws.\n\u200b\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur organizational documents contain anti\n-\ntakeover provisions.\n\u200b\nSeveral provisions of our articles of incorporation and our bylaws could make it difficult for our shareholders to change the composition of our board of directors in any one year, preventing them from changing the composition of management. In addition, the same provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that shareholders may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nauthorizing our board of directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred shares without shareholder approval;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nproviding for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nauthorizing the removal of directors only for cause;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nlimiting the persons who may call special meetings of shareholders;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings; and\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nrestricting business combinations with interested shareholders.\n \n\u200b\n\u200b",
    "item7": ">ITEM 7. \u2003MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. \n\u200b\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein. Among other things, those financial statements include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are presented in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. The following discussion contains forward\u2011looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under \"Item 1A\u2014Risk Factors,\" \"Forward\n-\nLooking Statements\" and elsewhere in this report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward\u2011looking statements.\n\u200b\nOverview \n\u200b\nWe are a Marshall Islands corporation, headquartered in the United States, focused on owning and operating VLGCs. Our fleet currently consists of twenty-five VLGCs, including one dual-fuel ECO VLGC, nineteen ECO VLGCs, one modern VLGC, and four time chartered-in VLGCs. \n\u200b\nOur dual-fuel ECO VLGC was delivered to us in March 2023. Our nineteen ECO VLGCs, which incorporate fuel efficiency and emission-reducing technologies and certain custom features, were acquired by us for an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion and delivered to us between July 2014 and February 2016, seventeen of which were delivered \n65\n\n\nTable of Contents\nduring calendar year 2015 or later and twelve are scrubber-equipped. Two of our four time chartered-in VLGCs are dual-fuel Panamax design and one of the time chartered-in VLGCs is scrubber-equipped.\n\u200b\nOn April 1, 2015, Dorian and Phoenix began operations of the Helios Pool, which entered into pool participation agreements for the purpose of establishing and operating, as charterer, under a variable rate time charter to be entered into with owners or disponent owners of VLGCs, a commercial pool of VLGCs whereby revenues and expenses are shared. The vessels entered into the Helios Pool may operate either in the spot market, pursuant to COAs or on time charters of two years' duration or less. \nAs of May 25, 2023, \ntwenty-three\n of our twenty-five VLGCs,\n \nincluding the four time chartered-in vessels, were deployed in the Helios Pool.\n\u200b\nOur customers, either directly or through the Helios Pool, include or have included global energy companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., China International United Petroleum & Chemicals Co., Ltd., Royal Dutch Shell plc, Equinor ASA, Total S.A., and Sunoco LP, commodity traders such as Glencore plc, Itochu Corporation, Bayegan Group, and the Vitol Group and importers such as E1 Corp., Indian Oil Corporation, SK Gas Co. Ltd., and Astomos Energy Corporation, or subsidiaries of the foregoing. For the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023, the Helios Pool accounted for 94% of our total revenues. No other individual charterer accounted for more than 10%. Within the Helios Pool, two charterers represented more than 10% of net pool revenues\u2014related party. For the year ended March 31, 2022, the Helios Pool accounted for 90% of our total revenues. No other individual charterer accounted for more than 10%. Within the Helios Pool, no charterers represented more than 10% of net pool revenues\u2014related party. For the year ended March 31, 2021, the Helios Pool accounted for 93% of our total revenues. No other individual charterer accounted for more than 10%. Within the Helios Pool, one charterer represented 16% of net pool revenues\u2014related party. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014We operate exclusively in the LPG shipping industry. Due to the general lack of industry diversification, adverse developments in the LPG shipping industry may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results\u201d and \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014We expect to be dependent on a limited number of customers for a material part of our revenues, and failure of such customers to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\u201d\n\u200b\nWe continue to pursue a balanced chartering strategy by employing our vessels on a mix of multi-year time charters, some of which may include a profit-sharing component, shorter-term time charters, spot market voyages and COAs. Two of our vessels are currently on fixed time charters outside of the Helios Pool. See \u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Our Fleet\u201d above for more information.\n\u200b\nRecent Development \n\u200b\nOn April 26, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors has declared an irregular cash dividend of $1.00 per share of the Company\u2019s common stock to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 8, 2023, totaling $40.4 million. We paid $40.1 million on May 22, 2023 and the remaining $0.3\u00a0million is deferred until certain shares of restricted stock vest.\n\u200b\nVessel Deployment\u2014Spot Voyages, Time Charters, COAs, and Pooling Arrangements\n\u200b\nWe seek to employ our vessels in a manner that maximizes fleet utilization and earnings upside through our chartering strategy in line with our goal of maximizing shareholder value and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate, taking into account fluctuations in freight rates in the market and our own views on the direction of those rates in the future. As of May 25, 2023, twenty-three of our twenty-five VLGCs, including the four time chartered-in vessels, were employed in the Helios Pool, which includes time charters with a term of less than two years.\n\u00a0\nA spot market voyage charter is generally a contract to carry a specific cargo from a load port to a discharge port for an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo or a specified total amount. Under spot market voyage charters, we pay voyage expenses such as port and fuel costs. A time charter is generally a contract to charter a vessel for a fixed period of time at a set daily or monthly rate. Under time charters, the charterer pays voyage expenses such as port and fuel costs. Vessels operating on time charters provide more predictable cash flows, but can yield lower profit margins than vessels operating in the spot market during periods characterized by favorable market conditions. Vessels operating in the spot market generate revenues that are less predictable but may enable us to capture increased profit margins during periods of \n66\n\n\nTable of Contents\nimprovements in the freight market although we are exposed to the risk of a decline in the freight market and lower utilization. Pools generally consist of a number of vessels which may be owned by a number of different ship owners which operate as a single marketing entity in an effort to produce freight efficiencies. Pools typically employ experienced commercial charterers and operators who have close working relationships with customers and brokers while technical management is typically the responsibility of each ship owner. Under pool arrangements, vessels typically enter the pool under a time charter agreement whereby the cost of bunkers and port expenses are borne by the charterer (\ni.e.\n, the pool) and operating costs, including crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel. Pools, in return, typically negotiate charters with customers primarily in the spot market. Since the members of a pool typically share in the revenue generated by the entire group of vessels in the pool, and since pools operate primarily in the spot market, including the pool in which we participate, the revenue earned by vessels placed in spot market related pools is subject to the fluctuations of the spot market and the ability of the pool manager to effectively employ its fleet. We believe that vessel pools can provide cost-effective commercial management activities for a group of similar class vessels and potentially result in lower waiting times and higher earnings.\n\u200b\nContracts of Affreightment (\u201cCOAs\u201d) relate to the carriage of multiple cargoes over the same or several routes at pre-agreed terms, volumes and periods and enables the COA holder to nominate and lift cargoes, without controlling tonnage themselves or having their own vessel in position. COAs are usually based on voyage terms, where all of the vessel's operating, voyage and capital costs are borne by the ship owner.\n\u200b\nOn April 1, 2015, Dorian and Phoenix began operation of the Helios Pool, which is a pool of VLGC vessels. We believe that the operation of certain of our VLGCs in this pool allows us to achieve better market coverage and utilization. Vessels entered into the Helios Pool are commercially managed jointly by Dorian LPG (DK) ApS, our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Phoenix. The members of the Helios Pool share in the net pool revenues generated by the entire group of vessels in the pool, weighted according to certain technical vessel characteristics, and net pool revenues (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein) are distributed as variable rate time charter hire to each participant. The vessels entered into the Helios Pool may operate either in the spot market, COAs, or on time charters of two years' duration or less. \nAs of May 25, 2023, the Helios Pool operated twenty-seven VLGCs, including twenty-three vessels from our fleet and four Phoenix vessels.\n \n\u200b\nFor further description of our business, please see \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d above.\n\u200b\nImportant Financial and Operational Terms and Concepts\n\u200b\nWe use a variety of financial and operational terms and concepts in the evaluation of our business and operations including the following:\n\u200b\nVessel Revenues.\n Our revenues are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet, the number of days during which our vessels operate and the daily rates that our vessels earn under our charters, which, in turn, are affected by a number of factors, including levels of demand and supply in the LPG shipping industry; the age, condition and specifications of our vessels; the duration of our charters; the timing of when any profit-sharing arrangements are earned; the amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels; the availability of our vessels, which is related to the amount of time that our vessels spend in drydock undergoing repairs and the amount of time required to perform necessary maintenance or upgrade work; and other factors affecting rates for LPG vessels.\n\u200b\n67\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe generate revenue by providing seaborne transportation services to customers pursuant to three types of contractual relationships: \n\u200b\nPooling Arrangements\n. As from April 1, 2015, we began operation of the Helios Pool. Net pool revenues\u2014related party for each vessel is determined in accordance with the profit-sharing terms specified within the pool agreement for the Helios Pool. In particular, the pool manager aggregates the revenues and voyage expenses of all of the pool participants and Helios Pool general and administrative expenses and distributes the net earnings to participants based on:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\npool points (vessel attributes such as cargo carrying capacity, fuel consumption, and speed are taken into consideration); and\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nnumber of days the vessel was on-hire in the Helios Pool in the period. \n\u200b\nFor the years ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023, 2022, and 2021, 94%, 90% and 93% of our revenue, respectively, was generated through the Helios Pool as net pool revenues\u2014related party. \n\u200b\nVoyage Charters.\n\u00a0 A voyage charter, or spot charter, is a contract for transportation of a specified cargo between two or more designated ports. This type of charter is priced at a current or \"spot\" market rate, typically on a price per ton of product carried. Under voyage charters, we are responsible for all of the voyage expenses in addition to providing the crewing and other vessel operating services. Revenues for voyage charters are more volatile as they are typically tied to prevailing market rates at the time of the voyage. Our gross revenue under voyage charters is generally higher than under comparable time charters so as to compensate us for bearing all voyage expenses. As a result, our revenue and voyage expenses may vary significantly depending on our mix of time charters and voyage charters. None of our revenue was generated pursuant to voyage charters from our VLGCs not in the Helios Pool for the years ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023, 2022, and 2021.\n\u200b\nTime Charters.\n\u00a0 A time charter is a contract under which a vessel is chartered for a defined period of time at a fixed daily or monthly rate. Under time charters, we are responsible for providing crewing and other vessel operating services, the cost of which is intended to be covered by the fixed rate, while the customer is responsible for substantially all of the voyage expenses, including bunker fuel consumption, port expenses and canal tolls. LPG is typically transported under a time charter arrangement, with terms ranging up to seven years. In addition, we may also have profit-sharing arrangements with some of our customers that provide for additional payments above a floor monthly rate (usually up to an agreed ceiling) based on the actual, average daily rate quoted by the Baltic Exchange for VLGCs on the benchmark Ras Tanura\u2011Chiba route over an agreed time period converted to a time charter equivalent (\u201cTCE\u201d) monthly rate. For the years ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023, 2022, and 2021, approximately 5.8%, 8.2% and 6.2%, respectively, of our revenue was generated pursuant to time charters from our VLGCs not in the Helios Pool. \n\u200b\nOther Revenues, net.\n\u00a0 Other revenues, net represent income from charterers, including the Helios Pool, relating to reimbursement of expenses such as costs for security guards and war risk insurance for voyages operating in high-risk areas. For the years ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023, 2022, and 2021, approximately 0.6%, 2.0% and 1.2%, respectively, of our revenue was generated pursuant to other revenues, net. \n\u200b\nOf these revenue streams, revenue generated from voyage charter agreements is further described in our revenue recognition policy as described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue generated from pools and time charters is accounted for as revenue earned under recently adopted accounting guidance to update the requirements of financial accounting and reporting for lessees and lessors as described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. \n\u200b\nCalendar Days.\n\u00a0 We define calendar days as the total number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet was owned or operated pursuant to a bareboat charter. Calendar days are an indicator of the size of the fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that are recorded during that period.\n\u200b\n68\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTime Chartered-in Days.\n\u00a0 We define time chartered-in days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which we time chartered-in vessels from third parties. Time chartered-in days are an indicator of the size of the fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of charter hire expenses that are recorded during that period.\n\u200b\nAvailable Days.\n\u00a0 We define available days as the sum of calendar days and time chartered-in days (collectively representing our commercially-managed vessels) less aggregate off hire days associated with major repairs and scheduled maintenance, which include drydockings, vessel upgrades or special or intermediate surveys. We use available days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period that our vessels should be capable of generating revenues.\n\u200b\nOperating Days.\n\u00a0 We define operating days as available days less the aggregate number of days that the commercially-managed vessels in our fleet are off\u2011hire for any reason other than major repairs and scheduled maintenance. We use operating days to measure the number of days in a period that our operating vessels are on hire.\n\u200b\nDrydocking.\n\u00a0 We must periodically drydock each of our vessels for any major repairs and maintenance and for inspection of the underwater parts of the vessel that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating and for any modifications to comply with industry certification or governmental requirements. The classification societies provide guidelines applicable to LPG vessels relating to extended intervals for drydocking. Generally, we are required to drydock a vessel under 15 years of age once every five years unless an extension of the drydocking to seven and one-half years is granted by the classification society and the vessel is not older than 20 years of age. We capitalize costs directly associated with the drydockings that extend the life of the vessel and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the period through the date the next survey is scheduled to become due under the \"Deferral\" method permitted under U.S. GAAP. Costs incurred during the drydocking period which relate to routine repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The number of drydockings undertaken in a given period and the nature of the work performed determine the level of drydocking expenditures.\n\u200b\nFleet Utilization.\n\u00a0 We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of operating days during a period by the number of available days during that period. An increase in non\u2011scheduled off\u2011hire days, including waiting time, would reduce our operating days, and therefore, our fleet utilization. We use fleet utilization to measure our ability to efficiently find suitable employment for our vessels.\n\u200b\nTime Charter Equivalent Rate.\n\u00a0 TCE rate is a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel. TCE rate is a shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period\u2011to\u2011period changes in a shipping company\u2019s performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (such as time charters, voyage charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. Our method of calculating TCE rate is to divide revenue net of voyage expenses by operating days for the relevant time period.\n\u200b\nVoyage Expenses.\n\u00a0 Voyage expenses are all expenses unique to a particular voyage, including bunker fuel consumption, port expenses, canal fees, charter hire commissions, war risk insurance and security costs. Voyage expenses are typically paid by us under voyage charters and by the charterer under time charters, including our VLGCs chartered to the Helios Pool. Accordingly, we generally only incur voyage expenses for our own account when performing voyage charters or during repositioning voyages between time charters for which no cargo is available or travelling to or from drydocking. We generally bear all voyage expenses under voyage charters and, as such, voyage expenses are generally greater under voyage charters than time charters. As a result, our voyage expenses may vary significantly depending on our mix of time charters and voyage charters.\n\u200b\nCharter Hire Expenses.\n\u00a0 We time charter hire certain vessels from third-party owners or operators for a contracted period and rate in order to charter the vessels to our customers. Charter hire expenses include vessel operating lease expense incurred to charter-in these vessels.\n\u200b\nVessel Operating Expenses.\n\u00a0 Vessel operating expenses are expenses that are not unique to a specific voyage. Vessel operating expenses are paid by us under each of our charter types. Vessel operating expenses include crew wages and related costs, the costs for lubricants, insurance, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance, the cost of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses. Our vessel operating expenses will increase with the \n69\n\n\nTable of Contents\nexpansion of our fleet and are subject to change because of higher crew costs, higher insurance premiums, unexpected repair expenses and general inflation. Furthermore, we expect maintenance costs will increase as our vessels age and during periods of drydock. \n\u200b\nDaily Vessel Operating Expenses.\n\u00a0 Daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time period.\n\u200b\nDepreciation and Amortization.\n\u00a0 We depreciate our vessels on a straight\u2011line basis using an estimated useful life of 25 years from initial delivery from the shipyard and after considering estimated salvage values.\n\u200b\nWe amortize the cost of deferred drydocking expenditures on a straight\u2011line basis over the period through the date the next drydocking/special survey is scheduled to become due.\n\u200b\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses.\n\u00a0 General and administrative expenses principally consist of the costs incurred in the corporate administration of the vessel and non\u2011vessel owning subsidiaries. We have granted restricted stock awards to certain of our officers, directors, employees and non-employee consultants that vest over various periods (see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). Granting of restricted stock results in an increase in expenses. Compensation expense for employees is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the awards and is recognized over the vesting period and for nonemployees is re-measured at the end of each reporting period based on the estimated fair value of the awards on that date and is recognized over the vesting period.\n\u200b\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\u200b\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates in the application of our accounting policies based on our best assumptions, judgments and opinions. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. For a description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included herein.\n\u200b\nVessel Depreciation.\n\u00a0 The cost of our vessels less their estimated residual value is depreciated on a straight\u2011line basis over the vessels' estimated useful lives. We estimate the useful life of each of our vessels to be 25 years from the date the vessel was originally delivered from the shipyard. Based on the current market and the types of vessels we have in our fleet, the residual values of our vessels are based upon a value of approximately $400 per lightweight ton. An increase in the useful life of our vessels or in their residual value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and extending it into later periods. An increase in the useful life of a vessel may occur as a result of superior vessel maintenance performed, favorable ocean going and weather conditions the vessel is subjected to, superior quality of the shipbuilding or yard, or high freight market rates, which result in owners scrapping the vessels later due to the attractive cash flows. A decrease in the useful life of our vessels or in their residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge and possibly result in an impairment charge. A decrease in the useful life of a vessel may occur as a result of poor vessel maintenance performed, harsh ocean going and weather conditions the vessel is subjected to, or poor quality of the shipbuilding or yard. If regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis, we will adjust the vessel's useful life to end at the date such regulations preclude such vessel's further commercial use.\n\u200b\nImpairment of vessels. \nWe review our vessels for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In addition, we compare independent appraisals to our carrying value for indicators of impairment to our vessels. When such indicators are present, an asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the estimate of future undiscounted net operating cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset over its remaining useful life and its eventual disposition to its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value is in excess of the estimated future undiscounted net operating cash flows. The impairment loss is measured based \n70\n\n\nTable of Contents\non the excess of the carrying amount over the fair market value of the asset. The new lower cost basis would result in a lower annual depreciation than before the impairment.\n\u200b\nOur estimates of fair market value assume that our vessels are all in good and seaworthy condition without need for repair and if inspected would be certified in class without notations of any kind. Our estimates are based on information available from various industry sources, including:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nreports by industry analysts and data providers that focus on our industry and related dynamics affecting vessel values;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nnews and industry reports of similar vessel sales;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\napproximate market values for our vessels or similar vessels that we have received from shipbrokers, whether solicited or unsolicited, or that shipbrokers have generally disseminated;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\noffers that we may have received from potential purchasers of our vessels; and\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nvessel sale prices and values of which we are aware through both formal and informal communications with shipowners, shipbrokers, industry analysts and various other shipping industry participants and observers.\n\u200b\nAs we obtain information from various industry and other sources, our estimates of fair market value are inherently uncertain. In addition, vessel values are highly volatile; as such, our estimates may not be indicative of the current or future fair market value of our vessels or prices that we could achieve if we were to sell them.\n\u200b\nAs of March 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, independent appraisals of the commercially and technically-managed VLGCs in our fleet had no indicators of impairment on any of our VLGCs in accordance with ASC 360 \nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\n. No impairment charges were recognized for the years ended March 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\u200b\nThe amount, if any, and timing of any impairment charges we may recognize in the future will depend upon the then current and expected future charter rates and vessel values, which may differ materially from those used in our estimates as of March 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n71\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe table set forth below indicates the carrying value of each commercially and technically-managed vessel in our fleet as of March\u00a031,\u00a02023 and 2022 at which times none of the

As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value and unamortized deferred charges related to drydocking of none of our vessels exceeded their estimated market value. On an aggregate fleet basis, the estimated market value of our vessels was higher than their carrying value and unamortized deferred charges related to drydocking as of March 31, 2022 by $85.1 million. There were no indications of impairment on any of our vessels and no impairment was recorded during the year ended March 31, 2022. \n\u200b\nDrydocking and special survey costs.\n\u00a0 We must periodically drydock each of our vessels to comply with industry standards, regulatory requirements and certifications. The classification societies provide guidelines applicable to LPG vessels relating to extended intervals for drydocking. Generally, we are required to drydock a vessel under 15 years of age once every five years unless an extension of the drydocking to seven and one-half years is granted by the classification society and the vessel is not older than 20 years of age.\n\u200b\nDrydocking costs are accounted under the deferral method whereby the actual costs incurred are deferred and are amortized on a straight\u2011line basis over the period through the date the next drydocking is scheduled to become due. Costs deferred include expenditures incurred relating to shipyard costs, hull preparation and painting, inspection of hull structure and mechanical components, steelworks, machinery works, and electrical works. Drydocking costs do not include vessel operating expenses such as replacement parts, crew expenses, provisions, luboil consumption, and insurance during the \n72\n\n\nTable of Contents\ndrydock period. Expenses related to regular maintenance and repairs of our vessels are expensed as incurred, even if such maintenance and repair occurs during the same time period as our drydocking.\n\u200b\nIf a drydocking is performed prior to the scheduled date, the remaining unamortized balances are immediately written off. Unamortized balances of vessels that are sold are written\u2011off and included in the calculation of the resulting gain or loss in the period of the vessel's sale. The nature of the work performed and the number of drydockings undertaken in a given period determine the level of drydocking expenditures.\n\u200b\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments.\n\u00a0 We use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit worthiness of both us and the swap counterparties. The estimated amount is the present value of estimated future cash flows, being equal to the difference between the benchmark interest rate and the fixed rate in the interest rate swap agreement, multiplied by the notional principal amount of the interest rate swap agreement at each interest reset date.\n\u200b\nThe fair value of our interest swap agreements at the end of each period is most significantly affected by the interest rate implied by the SOFR interest yield curve, including its relative steepness. Interest rates have experienced significant volatility in recent years in both the short and long term. While the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is typically more sensitive to changes in short\u2011term rates, significant changes in the long\u2011term benchmark interest rates also materially impact our interest.\n\u200b\nThe fair value of our interest swap agreements is also affected by changes in our own and our counterparty specific credit risk included in the discount factor. Our estimate of our counterparty's credit risk is based on the credit default swap spread of the relevant counterparty which is publicly available. The process of determining our own credit worthiness requires significant judgment in determining which source of credit risk information most closely matches our risk profile, which includes consideration of the margin we would be able to secure for future financing. A 10% increase / decrease in our own or our counterparty credit risk would not have had a significant impact on the fair value of our interest rate swaps.\n\u200b\nThe SOFR interest rate yield curve and our specific credit risk are expected to vary over the life of the interest rate swap agreements. The larger the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements outstanding and the longer the remaining duration of the interest rate swap agreements, the larger the impact of any variability in these factors will be on the fair value of our interest rate swaps. We economically hedge the interest rate exposure on a significant amount of our long\u2011term debt and for long durations. As such, we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, material variations in the period\u2011to\u2011period fair value of our derivative instruments.\n\u200b\nAlthough we measure the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing the inputs and assumptions described above, if we were to terminate the interest rate swap agreements at the reporting date, the amount we would pay or receive to terminate the derivative instruments may differ from our estimate of fair value. If the estimated fair value differs from the actual termination amount, an adjustment to the carrying amount of the applicable derivative asset or liability would be recognized in earnings for the current period. Such adjustments have been and could be material in the future. \n\u200b\nResults of Operations For The Year Ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023 As Compared To The Year Ended March 31, 2022\n\u200b\nRevenues\n\u200b\nThe following table compares revenues for the years ended March\u00a031:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nIncrease /\n\u200b\nPercent\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n(Decrease)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nChange\n\u200b\nNet pool revenues\u2014related party\n\u00a0\n$\n 364,548,262\n\u00a0\n$\n 246,305,480\n\u00a0\n$\n 118,242,782\n\u200b\n 48.0\n%\nTime charter revenues\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 22,709,620\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 22,377,211\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 332,409\n\u200b\n 1.5\n%\nOther revenues, net\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 2,491,333\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 5,538,757\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (3,047,424)\n\u200b\n (55.0)\n%\nTotal\n\u00a0\n$\n 389,749,215\n\u00a0\n$\n 274,221,448\n\u00a0\n$\n 115,527,767\n\u200b\n 42.1\n%\n\u200b\nRevenues, which represent net pool revenues\u2014related party, time charters and other revenues, net, were $389.7 million for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023, an increase of $115.5 million, or 42.1%, from $274.2 million for the year ended \n73\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMarch\u00a031,\u00a02022. The increase is primarily attributable to increased average TCE rates and a slight increase in fleet utilization. Average TCE rates of $50,462 for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023 increased $15,793 from $34,669 for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02022, primarily due to higher spot rates partially offset by higher bunker prices. The Baltic Exchange Liquid Petroleum Gas Index, an index published daily by the Baltic Exchange for the spot market rate for the benchmark Ras Tanura-Chiba route (expressed as U.S. dollars per metric ton), averaged $87.009 during the year ended March 31, 2023 compared to an average of $52.689 for the year ended March 31, 2022. The average price of very low sulfur fuel oil (expressed as U.S. dollars per metric ton) from Singapore and Fujairah increased from $609 during the year ended March 31, 2022, to $773 during the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023.Our fleet utilization increased from 94.9% during the year ended March 31, 2022 to 95.0% during the year ended March 31, 2023. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u200b\nCharter Hire Expenses\n\u200b\nCharter hire expenses for the vessels chartered in from third parties were $23.2 million for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023 compared to $16.3 million for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02022. The increase of $6.9 million, or 42.6%, was mainly caused by an increase in time chartered-in days from 579 for the year ended March 31, 2022 to 791 for the year ended March 31, 2023 and an increase in average time charter in expense per day from $28,093 for the year ended March 31, 2022 to $29,323 per day for the year ended March 31, 2023.\n\u200b\nVessel Operating Expenses\n\u200b\nVessel operating expenses were $71.5 million during the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023, or $9,793 per vessel per calendar day, which is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time period for the vessels that were in our fleet. This was a decrease of $2.7 million, or 3.6%, from $74.2 million, or $9,538 per vessel per calendar day, for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02022. The decrease was due to a reduction of calendar days for our fleet from 7,780 during the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02022 to 7,301 during the year ended March,\u00a031 2023, driven by the sales of\u00a0\nCaptain Markos NL\u00a0\nand\n\u00a0Captain Nicholas ML\n in 2022\n. \nAlso included in the $2.7 million decrease was a $1.3 million, or $160 per vessel per calendar day, decrease in operating expenses related to the drydocking of vessels including repairs and maintenance, spares and stores, coolant costs, and other drydocking related operating expenses.\n\u200b\nOn a per vessel per calendar day basis, vessel operating expenses increased modestly by $255 per vessel per calendar day, from $9,538 for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02022 to $9,793 per vessel per calendar day for the year ended March 31,\u00a02023. After adjusting for operating expenses related to the drydocking of vessels, vessel operating expenses increased $415 on a per vessel per calendar day basis. This increase was primarily the result of increases per vessel per calendar day of $138 related to repairs and maintenance, $117 related to lubricants and $160 for other vessel operating expenses.\n\u200b\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\u200b\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $32.1 million for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023, an increase of $1.9 million, or 6.2%, from $30.2 million for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02022. This increase was driven by (1) $0.9 million in financial support for the families of our Ukrainian and Russian seafarers affected by the events in Ukraine and (2) increases of $0.9 million and $1.5 million in stock-based compensation and other general and administrative expenses, respectively, partially offset by a reduction in employee-related expenses of $1.4 million primarily resulting from favorable changes in exchange rates.\n\u200b\nInterest and Finance Costs\n\u200b\nInterest and finance costs amounted to $37.8 million for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023, an increase of $10.7 million from $27.1 million for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02022. The increase of $10.7 million during the year ended March 31, 2023 was driven by increases of $11.3 million in interest incurred on our long-term debt and $0.8 million in loan expenses.\u00a0This was partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in capitalized interest and a decrease of $0.3 million in amortization of financing costs. The increase in interest on our long-term debt was driven by an increase in average interest rates due to rising SOFR on our floating-rate long-term debt, and an increase in average indebtedness, excluding deferred financing fees, from $609.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2022 to $649.0 million for the year ended \n74\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMarch\u00a031,\u00a02023. As of March\u00a031,\u00a02023, the outstanding balance of our long-term debt, excluding deferred financing fees, was $663.6 million. \n\u200b\nUnrealized Gain on Derivatives\n\u200b\nUnrealized gain on derivatives amounted to $2.8 million for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023 compared to $11.1 million for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02022. The $8.3 million difference is primarily attributable to reductions in notional amounts and an unfavorable change in forward SOFR yield curves (forward LIBOR curves in the prior period).\n\u200b\nRealized Gain/(Loss) on Derivatives\n\u200b\nRealized gain on derivatives was $3.8 million for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023, compared to a realized loss of $3.5 million for the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02022. The favorable $7.3 million difference is due to an increase in floating SOFR resulting in the realized gain on our interest rate swaps.\n\u200b\nGain on Disposal of Vessels\n\u00a0\nThere was no gain on disposal of vessels for the year ended March 31, 2023. Gain on disposal of vessels amounted to $7.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2022 and was attributable to the sales of\u00a0\nCaptain Markos NL\n and \nCaptain Nicholas ML.\n\u200b\nResults of Operations For The Year Ended March 31, 2022 As Compared To The Year Ended March 31, 2021\n\u200b\nFor a discussion of the year ended March 31, 2022 compared to the year ended March 31, 2021, please refer to Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022.\n\u200b\nOperating Statistics and Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\u200b\nTo supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with U.S.GAAP, we present certain operating statistics and non-GAAP financial measures to assist in the evaluation of our business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d) and time charter equivalent rate. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income and revenues, which are the most directly comparable measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \u00a0\n\u200b\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of our ongoing operations and in planning and forecasting future periods. These adjusted measures provide a more comparable basis to analyze operating results and earnings and are measures commonly used by shareholders to measure our performance. We believe that these adjusted measures, when considered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provide meaningful supplemental information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our business results and assessing our prospects for future performance. \u00a0 \n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear ended \n\u200b\nYear ended \n\u200b\nYear ended \n\u00a0\n(in U.S. dollars, except fleet data)\n\u200b\nMarch\u00a031,\u00a02023\n\u200b\nMarch\u00a031,\u00a02022\n\u200b\nMarch\u00a031,\u00a02021\n\u00a0\nFinancial Data\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\u200b\n$\n 271,386,648\n\u200b\n$\n 161,149,380\n\u200b\n$\n 188,555,935\n\u200b\nFleet Data\n(1)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nCalendar days\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 7,301\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 7,780\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 8,030\n\u200b\nTime chartered-in days\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 791\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 579\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 740\n\u200b\nAvailable days\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 8,053\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 8,201\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 8,505\n\u200b\nOperating days\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 7,652\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 7,785\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 7,891\n\u200b\nFleet utilization\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 95.0\n%\n\u200b\n 94.9\n%\n\u200b\n 92.8\n%\nAverage Daily Results\n(1)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nTime charter equivalent rate\n\u200b\n$\n 50,462\n\u200b\n$\n 34,669\n\u200b\n$\n 39,606\n\u200b\nDaily vessel operating expenses\n\u200b\n$\n 9,793\n\u200b\n$\n 9,538\n\u200b\n$\n 9,741\n\u200b\n75\n\n\nTable of Contents\n(1)\nRefer to \u201cImportant Financial and Operational Terms and Concepts\u201d above for definitions of calendar days, time chartered-in days, available days, operating days, fleet utilization, and daily vessel operating expenses.\n\u200b\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\u200b\nAdjusted EBITDA is an unaudited non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and represents net income before interest and finance costs, unrealized (gain)/loss on derivatives, realized (gain)/loss on interest rate swaps, stock-based compensation expense, impairment, and depreciation and amortization and is used as a supplemental financial measure by management to assess our financial and operating performance. We believe that adjusted EBITDA assists our management and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to period. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods of derivatives, interest and finance costs, stock-based compensation expense, impairment, and depreciation and amortization expense, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect net income/(loss) between periods. We believe that including adjusted EBITDA as a financial and operating measure benefits investors in selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives.\n\u200b\nAdjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in use and should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income.

For a discussion of the year ended March 31, 2022 compared to the year ended March 31, 2021, please refer to Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022.\n\u200b\nCapital Expenditures.\n LPG transportation is a capital\u2011intensive business, requiring significant investment to maintain an efficient fleet and to stay in regulatory compliance.\n\u200b\nWe are generally required to complete a special survey for a vessel once every five years. Drydocking of vessels occurs every five years unless an extension is granted by the classification society to seven and one-half years and the vessel is not older than 20 years of age. Intermediate surveys are performed every two and one-half years after the first special survey. Drydocking each vessel takes approximately 10 to 20 days. We spend significant amounts for scheduled drydocking (including the cost of classification society surveys) for each of our vessels. \n\u200b\nOn March 31, 2023, we took delivery of our newbuilding dual-fuel VLGC, \nCaptain Markos\n, from the shipyard of Kawasaki Heavy Industries. As our vessels age and our fleet expands, our drydocking expenses will increase. We estimate the current cash outlay for a VLGC special survey to be approximately $1.0 million per vessel (excluding any capital improvements, such as scrubbers and ballast water management systems, to the vessel that may be made during such drydockings and the cost of an intermediate survey to be between $100,000 and $200,000 per vessel. Ongoing costs for compliance with environmental regulations are primarily included as part of our drydocking and classification society survey costs. In order to comply with the International Maritime Organization mandated reductions in sulfur emissions that came into effect January 1, 2020, we have installed scrubbers on twelve of our vessels and have one chartered-in scrubber-equipped vessel, which allows us to burn heavy fuel oil. Our other non-dual fuel vessels currently consume compliant fuels on board (0.5% sulfur), which are readily available globally, but at a significantly higher cost. We have entered into contracts to purchase scrubbers on an additional three of our ECO VLGCs and we have contractual commitments for scrubber purchases of $3.5 million as of March 31, 2023. We also have one newbuilding dual-fuel VLGC and two chartered-in dual-fuel vessels that have the capability to burn LPG as fuel, which we believe provides an economic benefit over traditional fuel. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\u2014Risks Relating to Our Company\u2014We may incur \n80\n\n\nTable of Contents\nincreasing costs for the drydocking, maintenance or replacement of our vessels as they age, and, as our vessels age, the risks associated with older vessels could adversely affect our ability to obtain profitable charters.\u201d\n\u200b\nDescription of Our Debt Obligations\n\u200b\nSee Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a description of our debt obligations.\n\u200b\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\u200b\nRefer to Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included herein.\n\u200b",
    "item7a": ">ITEM 7A. \u2003QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\n\u200b\nWe are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency fluctuations, and inflation. \n\u200b\nInterest Rate Risk\n\u200b\nThe LPG shipping industry is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of investment. Much of this investment is provided in the form of long-term debt. Our debt agreement currently contains interest rates that fluctuate with SOFR. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a majority of our exposure to fluctuations of interest rate risk associated with our 2022 Debt Facility. We have hedged $183.5 million of amortizing principal as of March\u00a031,\u00a02023 and thus increasing interest rates could adversely impact our future earnings. For the 12 months following March\u00a031,\u00a02023, a hypothetical increase or decrease of 20 basis points in the underlying SOFR rates would result in an increase or decrease of our interest expense on our unhedged interest-bearing debt by $0.3 million assuming all other variables are held constant. See Notes 9 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a description of our debt obligations and interest rate swaps, respectively.\n\u200b\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n\u200b\nOur primary economic environment is the international LPG shipping market. This market utilizes the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Consequently, our revenues are in U.S. dollars and the majority of our operating expenses are in U.S. dollars. However, we incur some of our expenses in other currencies, particularly Euro, Singapore Dollar, Danish Krone, Japanese Yen, British Pound Sterling, and Norwegian Krone. The amount and frequency of some of these expenses, such as vessel repairs, supplies and stores, may fluctuate from period to period. Depreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies will increase the cost of us paying such expenses. For the year ended March\u00a031,\u00a02023, 25% of our expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization, interest and finance costs and gain/loss on derivatives), were in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and as a result we expect the foreign exchange risk associated with these operating expenses to be immaterial. We do not have foreign exchange exposure in respect of our credit facility and interest rate swap agreements, as these are denominated in U.S. dollars. \n\u200b\nThe portion of our business conducted in other currencies could increase in the future, which could expand our exposure to losses arising from currency fluctuations.\n\u200b\nInflation \n\u200b\nCertain of our operating expenses, including crewing, insurance and drydocking costs, are subject to fluctuations caused by market forces. Crewing costs in particular have risen over the past number of years as a result of a shortage of trained crews. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\u2014We may be unable to attract and retain key management personnel and other employees in the shipping industry without incurring substantial expense as a result of rising crew costs, which may negatively affect the effectiveness of our management and our results of operations.\" A shortage of qualified officers makes it more difficult to crew our vessels and may increase our operating costs. If this shortage were to continue or worsen, it may impair our ability to operate and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Inflationary pressures on bunker (fuel and oil) costs could have a material effect on our future operations \n81\n\n\nTable of Contents\nif the number of vessels employed on voyage charters increases. In the case of any vessels that are time\n-\nchartered to third parties, it is the charterers who pay for the fuel. If our vessels are employed under voyage charters, freight rates are generally sensitive to the price of fuel. However, a sharp rise in bunker prices may have a temporary negative effect on our results since freight rates generally adjust only after prices settle at a higher level. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\u2014Changes in fuel, or bunker, prices may adversely affect profits.\u201d\n\u200b\nAlthough inflation has had a moderate impact on our vessel operating expenses, insurance and corporate overheads, management does not consider inflation to be a significant risk to direct costs in the current and foreseeable economic environment. LPG transportation is a specialized area and the number of vessels is increasing. There will therefore be an increased demand for qualified crew and this has and will continue to put inflationary pressure on crew costs. However, in a shipping downturn, costs subject to inflation can usually be controlled because shipping companies typically monitor costs to preserve liquidity and encourage suppliers and service providers to lower rates and prices in the event of a downturn.\n\u200b\nForward Freight Agreements\n\u200b\nFrom time to time, we may take hedging or speculative positions in derivative instruments, including FFAs. The usage of such derivatives can lead to fluctuations in our reported results from operations on a period-to-period basis. Generally, freight derivatives may be used to hedge our exposure to the spot market for a specified route and period of time. Upon settlement, if the contracted charter rate is less than the average of the rates reported on an identified index for the specified route and time period, the seller of the FFA is required to pay the buyer the settlement sum, being an amount equal to the difference between the contracted rate and the settlement rate, multiplied by the number of days of the specified period. Conversely, if the contracted rate is greater than the settlement rate, the buyer is required to pay the seller the settlement sum. If we take positions in FFAs or other derivative instruments we could suffer losses in the settling or termination of these agreements. This could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Historically, we entered into FFAs as an economic hedge to reduce the risk on vessels trading in the spot market and to take advantage of short-term fluctuations in market prices. We do not classify these freight derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and therefore gains or losses are recognized in earnings. As of March 31, 2023, we had no outstanding FFA positions.\n\u200b",
