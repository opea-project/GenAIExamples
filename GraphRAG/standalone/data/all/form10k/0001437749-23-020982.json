Subscribers to the print versions have, in some cases, received free access to the corresponding digital versions, although digital subscribers do not receive a free print edition. The most comprehensive of the Company\u2019s online platforms is \nThe Value Line Research Center\n, which allows subscribers to access most of the Company\u2019s research and publications at a packaged price via the Internet.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvestment analysis software (\nThe Value Line Investment Analyzer\u00a0\nand \nThe New Value Line ETFs Service\n) includes data sorting and filtering tools. In addition, for institutional and professional subscribers, VLP offers current and historical financial databases (\nDataFile, Estimates & Projections, \nand \nMutual Funds\n) via the Internet.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe print and digital services include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Value Line Investment Survey \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Value Line Investment Survey\n is an investment periodical research service providing both timely articles on economic, financial and investment matters and analysis and ranks for equity securities. Two of the evaluations for covered equity securities are \"Timeliness\u2122\" and \"Safety\u2122\u201d. \u201cTimeliness\u201d Ranks relate to the probable relative price performance of one stock over the next six to twelve months, as compared to the rest of the stock coverage universe. Ranks are updated each week and range from Rank 1 for the expected best performing stocks to Rank 5 for the expected poorest performers. \"Safety\" Ranks are a measure of risk and are based on the issuer's relative Financial Strength and its stock's Price Stability. \"Safety\" ranges from Rank 1 for the least risky stocks to Rank 5 for the riskiest. VLP employs analysts and statisticians who prepare articles of interest for each periodical and who evaluate stock performance and provide future earnings estimates and quarterly written evaluations with more frequent updates when relevant. \nThe Value Line Investment Survey\n is comprised of three parts: The \"\nSummary & Index\n\" provides updated Timeliness and Safety Ranks, selected financial data, and \"screens\" of key financial measures; the \"\nRatings & Reports\n\" section contains the updated reports on stocks each week; and the \u201c\nSelection & Opinion\n\u201d section provides economic commentary and data, articles, and model portfolios managed by analysts covering a range of investment approaches.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Value Line Investment Survey - Small and Mid-Cap \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Value Line Investment Survey - Small and Mid-Cap\n is an investment research tool introduced in 1995 that provides short descriptions of and extensive data for small and medium-capitalization stocks, many listed on The NASDAQ Exchange, beyond the equity securities of generally larger-capitalization companies covered in \nThe Value Line Investment Survey\n. Like \nThe Value Line Investment Survey\n, the \nSmall and Mid-Cap\n has its own \"\nSummary & Index\n\" providing updated performance ranks and other data, as well as \"screens\" of key financial measures and two model portfolios. The print portion of the service is issued monthly. The 400 stocks of the Small & Mid-Cap universe selected for inclusion in the print component of the service are those of most importance to subscribers and are mailed to subscribers in updated monthly groups. Each stock is covered 4 times per year \u2013 once per quarterly cycle. The Digital component of the service remains unchanged -- updated weekly with the complete stock coverage universe available for review. The Performance Rank is designed to predict relative price performance over the next six to twelve months.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Value Line Fund Advisor Plus\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Value Line Mutual Fund Ranking System was introduced in 1993. It is the system utilized in the \nFund Advisor Plus, \nfeaturing load, no-load, and low-load open-end mutual funds. Each issue offers strategies for maximizing total return, and highlights of specific mutual funds. It also includes information about retirement planning and industry news. A full statistical review, including latest performance, ranks, and sector weightings, is updated each month on approximately 800 leading load, no-load and low-load funds. Included with this product is online access to Value Line\u2019s database of approximately 20,000 mutual funds, including screening tools and full-page printable reports on each fund. Four model portfolios are also part of the service. One recommends specific U.S. mutual funds from different objective groups, while the other highlights similar exchange traded funds (ETFs). The remaining two highlight mutual funds and ETFs globally. \nThe Value Line Fund Advisor Plus \ncontains data on approximately 20,000 no-load and low-load funds and a digital screener.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Value Line Special Situations Service \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Value Line Special Situations Service\n\u2019s core focus is on smaller companies whose equity securities are perceived by Value Line\u2019s analysts as having exceptional appreciation potential. This publication was introduced in 1951.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u00a0\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Value Line Daily Options Survey \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Value Line Daily Options Survey \nis a daily digital service that evaluates and ranks approximately 600,000 U.S. equity and equity index options.

It focuses each month on a single company that the Value Line Research Department has selected from a group of high-quality companies whose stocks are viewed as having a superior risk/reward ratio. Recommendations are backed by in-depth research and are subject to ongoing monitoring by research personnel.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValue Line Select: Dividend Income & Growth\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValue Line Select: Dividend Income & Growth \n(formerly\n Value Line Dividend Select\n), a monthly stock selection service, was introduced in June 2011. This product focuses on companies with dividend yields greater than the average of all stocks covered by Value Line, with a preference for companies that have consistently increased their dividends above the rate of inflation over the longer term and, based on Value Line analysis, have the financial strength both to support and increase dividend payments in the future.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValue Line Select: ETFs\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn May 2017, we launched \nValue Line Select: ETFs\n, a monthly ETF selection service. This product focuses on ETFs that appear poised to outperform the broader market. The selection process utilizes an industry approach, with the same data-focused analysis that is the hallmark of Value Line.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe New Value Line ETFs Service\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn September 2019, we introduced \nThe New Value Line ETFs Service\n. This online-only, web based analysis software\u00a0provides data, analysis, and screening capabilities on more than 2,700 publicly traded ETFs. Almost all of the ETFs tracked in the product are ranked by The Value Line ETF Ranking System, a proprietary estimate with the goal of predicting an ETF\u2019s future performance relative to all other ranked ETFs. The screener includes more than 30 fields, and each ETF has its own full PDF report. All data and information can be downloaded, exported, and printed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Value Line 600\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Value Line 600\n is a monthly publication, which contains full-page research reports on approximately 600 equity securities. Its reports provide information on many actively traded, larger capitalization issues as well as some smaller growth stocks. It offers investors who want the same type of analysis provided in \nThe Value Line Investment Survey\n, but who do not want or need coverage of all the companies covered by that product a suitable alternative. Readers also receive supplemental reports as well as a monthly Index, which includes updated statistics, including proprietary ranks and ratings.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u00a0\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValue Line Information You Should Know Wealth Newsletter\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis is a monthly service that started in January 2020.

The objective of the service is to identify companies that possess characteristics, such as a successful product lineup, market position or important technology that would interest larger corporations or private equity firms. The main feature of the M&A Service consists of a detailed, multipage highlight on a stock that Value Line thinks is a good acquisition candidate. New recommendations are then added to the M&A Model Portfolio.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Value Line Climate Change Investing Service\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis monthly service was introduced in April 2021. This publication, designed for the climate-conscious, profit-oriented investor, seeks to provide key climate news alongside a managed portfolio of twenty stocks, chosen by our analysts, which stand to benefit from responses to climate change. Selections are vetted based not only on time-tested financial measures, but also the potential impact of climate change and measures taken to combat it on their business. Our selections fall into two main groups: businesses that are focused on providing environmental solutions, and those that are likely to thrive in a changing climate. Every issue features new updates to our portfolio.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValue Line Investment Analyzer\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValue Line Investment Analyzer\n is a powerful menu-driven software program with fast filtering, ranking, reporting and graphing capabilities utilizing more than 230 data fields for various industries and indices and for the stocks covered in VLP\u2019s flagship publication, \nThe Value Line Investment Survey\n. \nValue Line Investment Analyzer\n allows subscribers to apply numerous charting and graphing variables for comparative research, and is integrated with the Value Line databases via the Internet.\u00a0 \nValue Line Investment Analyzer Professional\n is a more comprehensive product which covers nearly 5,500 stocks and allows subscribers to create customized screens.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValue Line DataFile Products\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor our institutional customers, Value Line offers both current and historical data for equities, mutual funds and exchange traded funds (\u201cETFs\u201d).

Value Line collects a copyright fee from each of the product sponsors/managers primarily based upon the market value of assets invested in each product\u2019s portfolio utilizing the Value Line proprietary data.

The business of EAM is managed by five individual trustees and a Delaware resident trustee (collectively, the \u201cTrustees\u201d) and by its officers subject to the direction of the Trustees.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCollectively, the holders of the voting profits interests in EAM are entitled to receive 50% of the residual profits of the business, subject to temporary adjustments in certain circumstances. Value Line holds a non-voting profits interest representing 50% of residual profits, subject to temporary adjustments in certain circumstances, and has no power to vote for the election, removal or replacement of the trustees of EAM. Value Line also has a non-voting revenues interest in EAM pursuant to which it is entitled to receive a portion of the non-distribution revenues of the business ranging from 41% at non-distribution fee revenue levels of $9 million or less to 55% at such revenue levels of $35 million or more. In the event the business is sold or liquidated, the first $56.1 million of net proceeds plus any additional capital contributions (Value Line or any holder of a voting profits interest, at its discretion, may make future contributions to its capital account in EAM), which contributions would increase its capital account but not its percentage interest in operating profits, will be distributed in accordance with capital accounts; 20% of the next $56.1 million will be distributed to the holders of the voting profits interests and 80% to the holder of the non-voting profits interests (currently, Value Line); and the excess will be distributed 45% to the holders of the voting profits interests and 55% to the holder of the non-voting profits interest (Value Line). EAM has elected to be taxed as a pass-through entity similar to a partnership.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, pursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, Value Line (1) granted each Fund use of the name \u201cValue Line\u201d so long as EAM remains the Fund\u2019s adviser and on the condition that the Fund does not alter its investment objectives or fundamental policies from those in effect on the date of the investment advisory agreement with EAM, provided also that the Funds do not use leverage for investment purposes or engage in short selling or other complex or unusual investment strategies that create a risk profile similar to that of so-called hedge funds, (2) agreed to provide EAM its proprietary Ranking System information without charge or expense on as favorable basis as to Value Line\u2019s best institutional customers and (3) agreed to capitalize the business with $7 million of cash and cash equivalents at inception.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEAM is organized as a Delaware statutory trust and has no fixed term. However, in the event that control of the Company\u2019s majority shareholder changes, or in the event that the majority shareholder no longer beneficially owns 5% or more of the voting securities of the Company, then the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to buy the voting profits interests in EAM at a fair market value to be determined by an independent valuation firm in accordance with the terms of the EAM Declaration of Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValue Line also has certain consent rights with respect to extraordinary events involving EAM, such as a proposed sale of all or a significant part of EAM, material acquisitions, entering into businesses other than asset management and fund distribution, paying compensation in excess of the mandated limit of 22.5%-30% of non-distribution fee revenues (depending on the level of such revenues), declaring voluntary bankruptcy, making material changes in tax or accounting policies or making substantial borrowings, and entering into related party transactions. These rights were established to protect Value Line\u2019s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       11\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u00a0\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEAM acts as the Adviser to the Value Line Funds. EULAV Securities acts as the Distributor for the Value Line Funds. State Street Bank, an unaffiliated entity, is the custodian of the assets of the Value Line Funds and provides them with fund accounting and administrative services. Shareholder services for the Value Line Funds are provided by SS&C, formerly named DST Asset Manager Solutions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by EAM and will continue to receive ongoing payments in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests, as discussed below. Total assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2023, were $3.09 billion, which is $0.27 billion, or 8.0%, below total assets of $3.36 billion in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2022. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTotal net assets of the Value Line Funds at April 30, 2023, were:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n($ in thousands)\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nValue Line Asset Allocation Fund\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n937,202\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nValue Line Capital Appreciation Fund\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n406,868\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nValue Line Mid Cap Focused Fund\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n695,794\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nValue Line Small Cap Opportunities Fund\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n408,656\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nValue Line Select Growth Fund\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n366,324\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nValue Line Larger Companies Focused Fund\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n236,706\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nValue Line Core Bond Fund\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n41,104\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTotal EAM managed net assets\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,092,654\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvestment management fees and distribution service fees (\u201c12b-1 fees\u201d) vary among the Value Line Funds and may be subject to certain limitations. Certain investment strategies among the equity funds include, but are not limited to, reliance on the Value Line Timeliness \u2122 Ranking System (the \u201cRanking System\u201d) and/or the Value Line Performance Ranking System in selecting securities for purchase or sale. Each Ranking System seeks to compare the estimated probable market performance of each stock during the next six to twelve months to that of all stocks under review in each system and ranks stocks on a scale of 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest). All the stocks followed by the Ranking System are listed on U.S. stock exchanges or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter markets. Prospectuses and annual reports for each of the Value Line open end mutual funds are available on the Funds\u2019 website \nwww.vlfunds.com\n.

Trademarks\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company holds trademark and service mark registrations for various names and logos in multiple countries. Value Line believes that these trademarks and service marks provide significant value to the Company and are an important factor in the marketing of its products and services, as well as in the marketing of the Value Line Funds, now managed by EAM. The Company maintains registrations of all active and eligible trademarks.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nF. Investments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company held total investment assets (excluding its interests in EAM) with a fair market value of $54,474,000 and $28,122,000, respectively, including equity securities and available-for-sale fixed income securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company held equity securities, which consist of investments in the SPDR Series Trust S&P Dividend ETF (SDY), First Trust Value Line Dividend Index ETF (FVD), ProShares Trust S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), IShares DJ Select Dividend ETF (DVY) and other Exchange Traded Funds and common stock equity securities. As of April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company held fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale, that consist of securities issued by United States federal government and bank certificates of deposit within the United States.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nG. Employees\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt April 30, 2023, the Company and its subsidiaries employed 138 people.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company and its affiliates, officers, directors and employees may from time to time own securities which are also held in the portfolios of the Value Line Funds or recommended in the Company's publications. Value Line analysts are not permitted to own securities of the companies they cover. The Company has adopted rules requiring reports of securities transactions by employees for their respective accounts. The Company has also established policies restricting trading in securities whose ranks are about to change in order to avoid possible conflicts of interest.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nH. Principal Business Segments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe information with respect to revenues from external customers and profit and loss of the Company's identifiable principal business segments is incorporated herein by reference to Note 18 of the Notes to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe investment periodicals and related publications (retail and institutional) and Value Line copyrights and Value Line Proprietary Ranks and other proprietary information, consolidated into one segment called Publishing. The Publishing segment constitutes the Company\u2019s only reportable business segment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI. Competition\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe investment information and publishing business conducted by the Company and the investment management business conducted by EAM are very competitive. There are many competing firms and a wide variety of product offerings. Some of the firms in these industries are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the Company and EAM. The Internet continues to increase the amount of competition in the form of free and paid online investment research. With regard to the investment management business conducted by EAM, the prevalence of broker supermarkets or platforms permitting easy transfer of assets among mutual funds, mutual fund families, and other investment vehicles tends to increase the speed with which shareholders can leave or enter the Value Line Funds based, among other things, on short-term fluctuations in performance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       13\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u00a0\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nJ.

    "item1a": ">ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to the risks referred to elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following risks, among others, sometimes may have affected, and in the future could affect, the Company\u2019s businesses, financial condition or results of operations and/or the investment management business conducted by EAM and consequently, the amount of revenue we receive from EAM. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not discussed or not presently known to us or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impact our businesses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are dependent on the efforts of its executives and professional staff.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s future success relies upon its ability to retain and recruit qualified professionals and executives. The Company\u2019s executive officers do not have employment agreements with the Company and the Company does not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on any of its executive officers. The loss of the services of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA decrease in the revenue generated by EAM\n\u2019\ns investment management business could adversely affect the Company\n\u2019\ns cash flow and financial condition.\n\n\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its cash flow from its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM. A decrease in the revenue generated by EAM\u2019s investment management business, whether resulting from performance, competitive, regulatory or other reasons, would reduce the amount of cash flow received by the Company from EAM, which reduction could adversely affect the Company\u2019s cash flow and financial condition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEAM\n\u2019\ns assets under management, which impact EAM\n\u2019\ns revenue, and consequently the amount of the cash flow that the Company receives from EAM, are subject to fluctuations based on market conditions and individual fund performance. \n\n\nFinancial market declines and/or adverse changes in interest rates would generally negatively impact the level of EAM\u2019s assets under management and consequently its revenue and net income. Major sources of investment management revenue for EAM (i.e., investment management and service and distribution fees) are calculated as percentages of assets under management. A decline in securities prices or in the sale of investment products or an increase in fund redemptions would reduce fee income. A prolonged recession or other economic or political events could also adversely impact EAM\u2019s revenue if it led to decreased demand for products, a higher redemption rate, or a decline in securities prices. Good performance of managed assets relative to both competing products and benchmark indices generally assists in both retention and growth of assets, and may result in additional revenues. Conversely, poor performance of managed assets relative to competing products or benchmark indices tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions with corresponding decreases in revenues to EAM. Poor performance could therefore reduce the amount of cash flow that the Company receives from EAM, which reduction could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEAM derives nearly all of its investment management fees from the Value Line Funds.\n\n\nEAM is dependent upon management contracts and service and distribution contracts with the Value Line Funds under which these fees are paid. As required by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), the Trustees/Directors of the Funds, all of whom are independent of the Company and EAM (except for the CEO of EAM), have the right to terminate such contracts. If any of these contracts are terminated, not renewed, or amended to reduce fees, EAM\u2019s financial results, and consequently, the amount of cash flow received by the Company from EAM, and the Company\u2019s financial condition, may be adversely affected.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA decrease in the revenue generated by a significant customer could adversely affect the Company\n\u2019\ns cash flow and financial condition.\n\n\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its cash flow and publishing revenues from a single significant customer.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf the Company does not maintain its subscriber base, its operating results could suffer.\n\u00a0\n\n\nA substantial portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is generated from print and digital subscriptions, which are paid in advance by subscribers. Unearned revenues are accounted for on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company within current and long-term liabilities. The backlog of orders is primarily generated through renewals and new subscription marketing efforts as the Company deems appropriate. Future results will depend on the renewal of existing subscribers and obtaining new subscriptions for the investment periodicals and related publications. The availability of competitive information on the Internet at low or no cost has had and may continue to have a negative impact on the demand for our products.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       15\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u00a0\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company believes that the negative trend in retail print subscription revenue experienced in recent years is likely to continue.\n\n\nDuring the last several years, the Company has experienced a negative trend in retail print subscription revenue. While circulation of some print publications has increased, others have experienced a decline in circulation or in average yearly price realized. It is expected that print revenues will continue to decline long-term, while the Company emphasizes digital offerings. The Company has established the goal of maintaining competitive digital products and marketing them through traditional and digital channels to retail and institutional customers. However, the Company is not able to predict whether revenues from digital retail publications will grow more than print revenues decline.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLoss of copyright clients or decline in their customers, or assets managed by third party sponsors could reduce the Company\n\u2019\ns revenues.\n\n\nCopyright agreements are based on market interest in the respective proprietary information. The Company believes this part of the business is dependent upon the desire of third parties to use the Value Line trademarks and proprietary research for their products, competition and on fluctuations in segments of the equity markets. If the fees from proprietary information decline, the Company\u2019s operating results could suffer.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFailure to protect its intellectual property rights and proprietary information could harm the Company\n\u2019\ns ability to compete effectively and could negatively affect operating results.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s trademarks are important assets to the Company. Although its trademarks are registered in the United States and in certain foreign countries, the Company may not always be successful in asserting global trademark protection. In the event that other parties infringe on its intellectual property rights and it is not successful in defending its intellectual property rights, the result may be a dilution in the value of the Company\u2019s brands in the marketplace. If the value of the Company\u2019s brands becomes diluted, such developments could adversely affect the value that its customers associate with its brands, and thereby negatively impact its sales. Any infringement of our intellectual property rights would also likely result in a commitment of Company resources to protect these rights through litigation or otherwise. In addition, third parties may assert claims against our intellectual property rights and we may not be able successfully to resolve such claims. The Company is utilizing all of its trademarks and properly maintaining registrations for them.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdverse changes in market and economic conditions could lower demand for the Company\n\u2019\ns and EAM\n\u2019\ns products and\n\u00a0\nservices.\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company provides its products and services to individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients. Adverse conditions in the financial and securities markets may\u00a0have an impact on the Company\u2019s subscription revenues, securities income, and copyright fees which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Adverse conditions in the financial and securities markets could also have an adverse effect on EAM\u2019s investment management revenues and reduce the amount of cash flow that the Company receives from EAM, which reduction could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company and EAM face significant competition in their respective businesses. \n\n\nBoth the investment information and publishing business conducted by the Company and the investment management business conducted by EAM are very competitive. There are many competing firms and a wide variety of product offerings. Some of the firms in these industries are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the Company and EAM. With regard to the investment information and publishing business, barriers to entry have been reduced by the minimal cost structure of the Internet and other technologies. With regard to the investment management business, the absence of significant barriers to entry by new investment management firms in the mutual fund industry increases competitive pressure. Competition in the investment management business is based on various factors, including business reputation, investment performance, quality of service, marketing, distribution services offered, the range of products offered and fees charged. Access to mutual fund distribution channels has also become increasingly competitive.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       16\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u00a0\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGovernment regulations, any changes to government regulations, and regulatory proceedings and litigation may adversely impact the business. \n\n\nChanges in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements could have an effect on EAM\u2019s operations and results, including but not limited to increased expenses and restraints on marketing certain funds and other investment products. EAM is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the \u201cAdvisers Act\u201d). The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary, record keeping, operational and disclosure obligations. ES is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, also known as \u201cFINRA\u201d. Each Value Line Fund is a registered investment company under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act requires numerous compliance measures, which must be observed, and involves regulation by the SEC. Each fund and its shareholders may face adverse tax consequences if the Value Line Funds are unable to maintain qualification as registered investment companies under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Those laws and regulations generally grant broad administrative powers to regulatory agencies and bodies such as the SEC and FINRA. If these agencies and bodies believe that EAM, ES or the Value Line Funds have failed to comply with their laws and regulations, these agencies and bodies have the power to impose sanctions. EAM, ES and the Value Line Funds, like other companies, can also face lawsuits by private parties. Regulatory proceedings and lawsuits are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policies, and the costs associated with compliance, could adversely affect the business and operations of the EAM, ES and the Value Line Funds. An adverse resolution of any regulatory proceeding or lawsuit against the EAM or ES could result in substantial costs or reputational harm to them or to the Value Line Funds and have an adverse effect on their respective business and operations. An adverse effect on the business and operations of EAM, ES and/or the Value Line Funds could reduce the amount of cash flow that the Company receives in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM and, consequently, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTerrorist attacks could adversely affect the Company and EAM. \n\n\nA terrorist attack, including biological or chemical weapons attacks, and the response to such terrorist attacks, could have a significant impact on the New York City area, the local economy, the United States economy, the global economy, and U.S. and/or global financial markets, and could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and on the investment management business conducted by EAM.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFuture pandemic outbreaks could disrupt the Company\n\u2019\ns operations.\n\n\nA substantial recurrence of infections of the COVID-19 virus or its variants could disrupt Company printing and distribution operations, or supplies of materials and services needed for the print publishing business. While the Company believes that its office, editorial, and administrative operations, and those of its suppliers of data and other services, are adequately backed-up for fully remote operations if needed, likewise a future pandemic outbreak could interfere with the continuity of printing and distribution operations, as well as endangering personnel of the Company and its supply chain partners.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur controlling stockholder exercises voting control over the Company and has the ability to elect or remove from office all of our directors.\n\n\nAs of April 30, 2023, AB&Co., Inc. beneficially owned 91.51% of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s voting stock. AB&Co. is therefore able to exercise voting control with respect to all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election or removal from office of all of our directors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are not subject to most of the listing standards that normally apply to companies whose shares are quoted on NASDAQ.\n\n\nOur shares of common stock are quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d). Under the NASDAQ listing standards, we are deemed to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d by virtue of the fact that AB&Co. has voting power with respect to more than 50% of our outstanding shares of voting stock. A controlled company is not required to have a majority of its board of directors comprised of independent directors. Director nominees are not required to be selected or recommended for the board\u2019s selection by a majority of independent directors or a nomination committee comprised solely of independent directors, nor do the NASDAQ listing standards require a controlled company to certify the adoption of a formal written charter or board resolution, as applicable, addressing the nominations process. A controlled company is also exempt from NASDAQ\u2019s requirements regarding the determination of officer compensation by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. Although we currently comply with certain of the NASDAQ listing standards that do not apply to controlled companies, our compliance is voluntary, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to comply with these standards in the future.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       17\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u00a0\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are subject to cyber risks and may incur costs in connection with our efforts to enhance and ensure security from cyber attacks.\n\n\nSubstantial aspects of our\u00a0business depend on the secure operation of our computer systems and e-commerce\u00a0websites. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of\u00a0sensitive information, including our own proprietary information and that of our customers\u00a0and employees.\u00a0While we devote substantial resources to maintaining adequate levels of cyber security,\u00a0our resources\u00a0and technical sophistication may not be adequate to prevent all of the rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs for technology, personnel, insurance and services to enhance security or to respond to occurrences. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any possible future breaches of our systems.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChanges to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may affect how we conduct our business and affect our reported results of operations.\n\n\nNew accounting pronouncements or tax rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future. A change in accounting pronouncements or interpretations or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. Changes to existing rules and pronouncements, future changes, if any, or the questioning of current practices or interpretations may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n",

Value Line markets under well-known brands including \nValue Line\n\u00ae\n, the Value Line \nlogo\u00ae, \nThe Value Line Investment Survey\n\u00ae\n, Smart Research, Smarter Investing\n\u2122\n \nand \nThe Most Trusted Name in Investment Research\n\u00ae\n.\n The name \"Value Line\" as used to describe the Company, its products, and its subsidiaries, is a registered trademark of the Company. EULAV Asset Management Trust (\u201cEAM\u201d) was established to provide the investment management services to the Value Line Funds, institutional and individual accounts and provide distribution, marketing, and administrative services to the Value Line\u00ae Mutual Funds (\"Value Line Funds\"). The Company maintains a significant investment in EAM from which it receives payments in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s target audiences within the investment research field are individual investors, colleges, libraries, and investment management professionals. Individuals come to Value Line for complete research in one package. Institutional licensees consist of corporations, financial professionals, colleges, and municipal libraries. Libraries and universities offer the Company\u2019s detailed research to their patrons and students. Investment management professionals use the research and historical information in their day-to-day businesses. The Company has a dedicated department that solicits institutional subscriptions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPayments received for new and renewal subscriptions and the value of receivables for amounts billed to retail and institutional customers are recorded as unearned revenue until the order is fulfilled. As the orders are fulfilled, the Company recognizes revenue in equal installments over the life of the particular subscription. Accordingly, the subscription fees to be earned by fulfilling subscriptions after the date of a particular balance sheet are shown on that balance sheet as unearned revenue within current and long-term liabilities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe investment periodicals and related publications (retail and institutional) and Value Line copyrights and Value Line Proprietary Ranks and other proprietary information consolidate into one segment called Publishing. The Publishing segment constitutes the Company\u2019s only reportable business segment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAsset Management and Mutual Fund Distribution Businesses \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company maintains an interest in certain revenues of EAM and a portion of the residual profits of EAM but has no voting authority with respect to the election or removal of the trustees of EAM or control of its business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       21\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u00a0\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe business of EAM is managed by its trustees each owning 20% of the voting interest in EAM and by its officers subject to the direction of the trustees. The Company\u2019s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM entitle it to receive a range of 41% to 55% of EAM\u2019s revenues (excluding distribution revenues) from EAM\u2019s mutual fund and separate account business and 50% of the residual profits of EAM (subject to temporary increase in certain limited circumstances). The Voting Profits Interest Holders will receive the other 50% of residual profits of EAM. Distribution is not less than 90% of EAM\u2019s profits payable each fiscal quarter under the provisions of the EAM Trust Agreement.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBusiness Environment \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe pace of economic growth slowed moderately in the first half of calendar 2023. The gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by an annualized rate of 2.0% in the March period and the consensus forecast expected\u00a0that the pace eased to around 1.0% in the June interim. (The first estimate for second-quarter GDP surprised to the upside with a reading of 2.4%.) This followed respective annualized advances of 3.2% and 2.6% in the third and fourth quarters of 2022. The Federal Reserve\u2019s increasingly restrictive monetary policies\u2014implemented to battle inflation by slowing demand for goods and services and ultimately putting downward pressure on prices\u2014hurt the housing and manufacturing sectors, though recent data suggests that the housing market may be emerging from a recessionary phase in 2022. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve, faced with inflation running at a 40-year high entering 2022, embarked on a highly restrictive monetary policy tightening course. This resulted in the central bank hiking the benchmark short-term interest rate at 10-consecutive Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings before pausing at the June meeting. This hawkish stance raised the federal funds rate from near-zero in the spring of 2022 to the current range of\u00a05.25% to 5.50% announced on July 26th. Recent data have shown that inflation eased some this spring, with both consumer and producer price growth well off multi-decade highs established in 2021. On point, the June Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed prices rose 0.2% on a month-to-month basis, which was up modestly from the May reading of 0.2%, but came in below the consensus expectation calling for an increase of 0.3%. Furthermore, the core CPI, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components, increased 0.2% in June, which was half the prior month\u2019s pace. On a 12-month basis, the CPI rose 3.0%, which was down markedly from the May rate of 4.0%.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, several Federal Open Market Committee voting members believe that multiple interest-rate hikes are still plausible in the second half of 2023, including a quarter-point increase at the soon-to-commence July FOMC meeting. Those senior Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, think the federal funds rate needs to rise to the lead bank\u2019s recently revised 2023 target of 5.60% and stay at or above that level for an extended period to bring price growth closer to its long-term target rate of 2.0%. Wall Street remains skeptical that the Fed will be that hawkish, as the central bank said it will be \u201cdata dependent\u201d in formulating monetary policy. Thus, with many market pundits thinking that a continued downward trend in prices will be seen in the upcoming inflation readings, the Street believes that the Fed may reconsider its hawkish position.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe economic data of late have been better than expected, highlighted by surprising recoveries in homebuilding activity and auto sales during the month of May. This, along with the continued strength of the consumer and labor markets, despite the Fed\u2019s best efforts to slow demand for goods and services and ultimately push prices lower, gives more credence to the notion that the Fed can orchestrate a \u201csoft landing\u201d for the economy, as it likely nears the end of its most aggressive interest-rate tightening course in four decades.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s push to stabilize prices has not yet hurt the other part of its dual mandate. Indeed, the labor market remains healthy, with recently laid-off workers and those looking for a better position still finding new jobs rather quickly. Labor market conditions remain tight, despite a lower-than-expected jobs gain of 209,000 in June. Overall, nonfarm payrolls increased by 1.67 million positions through the first half of 2023. The health of the labor market has been a key driver behind the resiliency of the consumer sector amid high inflation. Whether this will continue is the big question, as some headwinds for the consumer are swirling. These include consumer credit card balances rising to record levels this year, the resumption of student loan repayments this September, and the likely reduction of COVID-19 stimulus-enhanced savings accounts. Given these factors, it is hard to envision the consumer keeping up the recent hot pace of spending beyond the latter stages of this year.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       22\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u00a0\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn conclusion, the aggressive monetary policy tightening stance by the Federal Reserve may ultimately push the U.S. economy into a recession, but the narrative calling for a \u201csoft landing\u201d has gained steam, given the recent improved economic data. The continued inversion of the Treasury market yield curve (that occurs when rates on longer-term obligations are lower than those of shorter-term durations), the sharp reduction in the U.S. money supply, two-consecutive quarters of corporate earnings declines, and the recent economic struggles for China and Germany (two important trading partners of the United States), may indicate some economic challenges ahead. From a stock market perspective, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 companies in early July stood at nearly 19, compared to the 10-year average of 17.4x. This elevated valuation may leave equities vulnerable to any disappointing news on the economic, earnings, and geopolitical fronts.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       23\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u00a0\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Years 2023, 2022 and 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following table illustrates the Company\u2019s key components of revenues and expenses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nFiscal Years Ended April 30,\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nChange\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n($ in thousands, except earnings per share)\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n2023\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n2022\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n2021\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n'23 vs. '22\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n'22 vs. '21\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIncome from operations\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n11,470\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n10,800\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n7,535\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n43.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGain on forgiveness of SBA loan\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,331\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNon-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests from EAM Trust\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11,131\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18,041\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n17,321\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-38.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIncome from operations plus non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests from EAM Trust and gain on SBA loan forgiveness\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n22,601\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n31,172\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n24,856\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-27.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n25.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOperating expenses\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n28,225\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n29,725\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n32,857\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-5.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-9.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nInvestment gains / (losses)\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,174\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(534\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5,420\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIncome before income taxes\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n23,775\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n30,638\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n30,276\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-22.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNet income\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n18,069\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n23,822\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n23,280\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-24.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEarnings per share\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1.91\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n2.50\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n2.43\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-23.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDuring the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, the Company\u2019s net income of $18,069,000, or $1.91 per share, was 24.1% below net income of $23,822,000, or $2.50 per share, for the twelve months ended April 30, 2022.

The Company continued activity to attract new subscribers, primarily digital subscriptions through various marketing channels, primarily direct mail, e-mail, and by the efforts of our sales personnel. As fewer individual investors manage their own portfolios, total product line circulation at April 30, 2023, was 10.4% below total product line circulation at April 30, 2022. However, during the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, Institutional Sales department total sales orders, representing our growing business with financial advisors and professional investors, reached a record of $15,236,000, 10.0% above the prior fiscal year. The retail telemarketing sales team generated total sales orders of $7,409,000 or 10.6% below the prior fiscal year.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur circulation declined as a result of management\u2019s decision to reduce marketing efforts while the challenging stock market environment persisted.

During the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, print publication revenues of $9,963,000, decreased 11.5%, below print publication revenues of $11,253,000 during April of 2022 because we deferred advertising in light of negative sentiment among prospective individual customers in a challenging market environment. Total digital circulation at April 30, 2023 was 2.7% below total digital circulation at April 30, 2022 with the professional clientele offsetting individual subscribers. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, digital revenues of $16,269,000 were up 2.4% as compared to the prior fiscal year. These figures reflect weak investor sentiment, likely temporary, and the ongoing shift from our print services to digital counterparts. Further, publishing revenue is fairly steady, despite the dip in print circulation. Sales of our higher-price, higher-profit, publications have been stronger than sales of lower price \u201cstarter\u201d products.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvestment periodicals and related publications revenues of $27,145,000 (excluding copyright fees) during the twelve months ended April 30, 2022 were 1.8% below publishing revenues of $27,629,000, which included an extra week of servings for the weekly print products during the twelve months ended April 30, 2021, (decreased 1.1% excluding the extra week of print products servings), as compared to the prior fiscal year.

Proceeds from the sales of equity securities during the twelve months ended April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022 were $4,706,000 and $12,039,000, respectively. There were no capital gain distributions from ETFs in fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDuring the twelve months ended April 30, 2022, the Company\u2019s investment gains, primarily derived from dividend and interest income, investment losses recognized on sales of equity securities during the period and unrealized gains recognized on equity securities held at the end of the period in fiscal 2022, resulted in a loss of $534,000. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2021, the Company\u2019s investment gains, primarily derived from dividend and interest income, investment gains recognized on sales of equity securities during the period and unrealized gains recognized on equity securities held at the end of the period in fiscal 2021, was $5,420,000. Proceeds from maturities and sales of government debt securities classified as available-for-sale during the twelve months ended April 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021, were $2,496,000 and $14,902,000, respectively. Proceeds from the sales of equity securities during the twelve months ended April 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021 were $12,039,000 and $8,212,000, respectively. There were no capital gain distributions from ETFs in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEffective income tax rate\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe overall effective income tax rates, as a percentage of pre-tax ordinary income for the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, April 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021 were 24.00%, 22.25% and 23.11%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate during for the twelve months ended April 30, 2023 as compared to April 30, 2022, is primarily a result of the non-taxable revenue derived from forgiveness of the PPP loan by the SBA offset by an increase in the state and local income taxes from 3.12% to 3.25% as a result of changes in state and local income tax allocation factors, on deferred taxes in fiscal 2023. The Company's annualized overall effective tax rate fluctuates due to a number of factors, in addition to changes in tax law, including but not limited to an increase or decrease in the ratio of items that do not have tax consequences to pre-income tax, the Company's geographic profit mix between tax jurisdictions, taxation method adopted by each locality, new interpretations of existing tax laws and rulings and settlements with tax authorities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $42,788,000 as of April 30, 2023 and $37,580,000 as of April 30, 2022. These amounts include short-term unearned revenue of $16,771,000 and $17,688,000 reflected in total current liabilities at April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively. Cash and short-term securities were $62,064,000 and $57,825,000 as of April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       33\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u00a0\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents include $7,240,000 and $28,965,000 at April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively, invested primarily in commercial banks and in Money Market Funds at brokers, which operate under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act and invest primarily in short-term U.S. government securities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCash from operating activities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company had cash inflows from operating activities of $18,178,000 during the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, compared to cash inflows from operations of $24,646,000 and $16,410,000 during the twelve months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in cash flows from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 is primarily attributable to lower pre-tax income and a decrease in cash receipts from EAM and the timing of receipts from copyright programs. The increase in cash flows from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 is primarily attributable to higher pre-tax income and an increase in cash receipts from EAM and the timing of receipts from copyright programs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCash from investing activities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s cash outflows from investing activities of $26,116,000 during the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, compared to cash outflows from investing activities of $3,389,000 and cash inflows of $7,381,000 for the twelve months ended April 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021, respectively. Cash outflows for the twelve months ended April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022, were primarily due to the Company\u2019s decision to invest in additional fixed income securities, primarily United States government obligations, in fiscal 2023 and 2022.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCash from financing activities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDuring the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, the Company\u2019s cash outflows from financing activities were $14,175,000 and compared to cash outflows from financing activities of $10,889,000 and $9,574,000 for the twelve months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash outflows for financing activities included $4,704,000, $2,484,000 and $1,526,000 for the repurchase of 75,303 shares, 53,327 shares and 53,551 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock under the July 2021, March 2022, May 2022 & October 2022 board approved common stock repurchase programs, during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During fiscal 2020, the Company applied for and received an SBA loan under the Paycheck Protection Program in the amount of $2,331,000. The obligation to repay the SBA loan under the Paycheck Protection Program was forgiven during fiscal 2022. Quarterly regular dividend payments of $0.25 per share during fiscal 2023 aggregated $9,471,000. Quarterly regular dividend payments of $0.22 per share during fiscal 2022 aggregated $8,405,000. Quarterly regular dividend payments of $0.21 per share during fiscal 2021 aggregated $8,068,000.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt April 30, 2023 there were 9,434,540 common shares outstanding as compared to 9,509,843 common shares outstanding at April 30, 2022. The Company expects financing activities to continue to include use of cash for dividend payments for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement believes that the Company\u2019s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its business together with the proceeds from the SBA loan and the future cash flows from operations and from the Company\u2019s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM will be sufficient to finance current and forecasted liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond next year. Management does not anticipate making any additional borrowings during the next twelve months. As of April 30, 2023, retained earnings and liquid assets were $95,979,000 and $62,064,000, respectively. As of April 30, 2022, retained earnings and liquid assets were $87,645,000 and $57,825,000, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSeasonality\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur publishing revenues are comprised of subscriptions which are generally annual subscriptions. Our cash flows from operating activities are minimally seasonal in nature, primarily due to the timing of customer payments made for orders and subscription renewals.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       34\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u00a0\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2019-12, \u201cIncome Taxes (Topic740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\u201d as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in the accounting standards. The standard eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes including interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax laws. The Company adopted this guidance effective May 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn June 21, 2018, the United States Supreme Court reversed the 1992 ruling in \nQuill\n, which protected firms delivering items by common carrier into a state where it had no physical presence from having to collect sales tax in such state. The Company has integrated the effects of the various state laws into its operations and continues to do so.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as in effect in the United States (U.S. \u201cGAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent, and the Company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nValuation of EAM\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvestment in EAM Trust\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company accounts for its investment in EAM using the equity method of accounting. The value of its investment in EAM is the fair value of the contributed capital at inception, plus the Company\u2019s share of non-voting revenues and non-voting profits from EAM, less distributions received from EAM. The Company evaluates its investment in EAM on a regular basis for other-than-temporary impairment, which requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShould the fair value of the investment fall below its carrying value, the Company will determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company will write down the investment to its fair value. Since the inception of EAM, the Company has not recognized any other-than-temporary impairment in the investment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nContractual Obligations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a party to lease contracts which will result in cash payments to landlords in future periods. Operating lease liabilities are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next four fiscal years and thereafter are (in thousands): $1,634 in 2024; $1,429 in 2025; $1,461 in 2026; $1,493 in 2027 and $882 thereafter totaling $6,899.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       35\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u00a0\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMarket Risk Disclosures\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet includes a substantial amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risks. The Company\u2019s market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity price risk. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with the Company\u2019s investment activities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s strategy has been to acquire debt securities with low credit risk. Despite this strategy management recognizes and accepts the possibility that losses may occur. To limit the price fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes, the Company\u2019s management invests primarily in short-term obligations maturing within one year.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe fair values of the Company\u2019s fixed maturity investments will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, and other general market conditions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFixed income securities consist of certificates of deposits and securities issued by federal, state and local governments within the United States. As of April 30, 2023 the aggregate cost and fair value of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were $39,455,000 and $39,928,000, respectively. As of April 30, 2022 the aggregate cost and fair value of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were $10,505,000 and $10,475,000, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks. The hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available.

Market prices are subject to fluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. Furthermore, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s equity investment strategy has been to acquire equity securities across a diversity of industry groups. The portfolio consists of ETFs held for dividend yield that attempt to replicate the performance of certain equity indexes and ETFs that hold preferred shares primarily of financial institutions.

The Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer are engaged in a comprehensive effort to review, evaluate and improve the Company's controls; however, management does not expect that the Company's disclosure controls or its internal controls over financial reporting can prevent all possible errors and fraud.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company\u2019s reports filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and, the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this\u00a0report.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Under applicable SEC rules, no such attestation report by the Company's registered public accounting firm is required.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChanges in Internal Controls\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the course of the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer considered certain internal control areas in which the Company has made and is continuing to make changes to improve and enhance controls. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer of the Company concluded that there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n(b)\n \n \nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\n \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule\u00a013a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company\u2019s principal executive and principal financial officers, and effected by the board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP including those policies and procedures that: (I)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and (iii)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    39\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u00a0\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President & Treasurer, acting as Principal Financial Officer, the Company has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria described in Internal Control\u00a0- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the Company did maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere have been no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control systems over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The Company administrative and finance personnel have been operating on a near-fully remote basis during the entirety of the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023 as a result of pandemic restrictions and precautions. The internal control systems have remained intact.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nItem 9B.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to the accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    49\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u00a0\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Entity\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company uses the equity method of accounting to report its investment in its unconsolidated entity. As of April 30, 2023, the carrying value of the investment was $58,775,000. On an annual basis, management performs an impairment assessment to ensure that the carrying value of the investment in its unconsolidated entity is properly reflected.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to such assessment is a critical audit matter are that there were significant judgements made by management in estimating the fair value of the investment and the fact that management utilized a specialist to assist in its determination of fair value. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgement, subjectivity, and audit effort in evaluating management\u2019s estimation of the fair value of the investment in its unconsolidated entity, including management\u2019s assessment of the unconsolidated entity\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, reviewing management\u2019s process for estimating the fair value of the investment in its unconsolidated entity, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation model, testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the model, and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n/s/ \nHorowitz
