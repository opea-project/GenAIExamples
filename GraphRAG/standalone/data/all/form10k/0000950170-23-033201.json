FedEx Freight will continue to provide LTL freight transportation services as a stand-alone and separate company under Federal Express Corporation. The organizational redesign will be implemented in phases with full implementation expected in June 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability, including Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have announced the implementation of Network 2.0 in more than 20 markets, including the phased transition of all FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to FedEx Express beginning in April 2024. Under Network 2.0, FedEx will continue to utilize both employees and contracted service providers. See \u201cBusiness Segments\u201d below, \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d and \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report for more information on one FedEx, Network 2.0, and DRIVE.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nStrategy\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe collective FedEx brand gives us our competitive edge. Further, our strategy allows us to manage our business as a portfolio, in the long-term best interest of the enterprise. As a result, we base decisions on capital investment and service additions or enhancements upon achieving the highest overall long-term return on capital for our business as a whole. We focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our long-term earnings performance and cash flow. Our business strategy also provides flexibility in structuring our network to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate, allowing us to leverage and manage change. Volatility, uncertainty, and evolution have become the norms in the global transportation market, and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy.\n\n\n \n\n\nOver the last 50 years, we built networks that have created a differentiated and unmatched portfolio of services while continuously evolving to meet the changing needs of our customers and the market. We made significant investments in our service network in recent years to build out our infrastructure and services to meet increased e-commerce demand. Through one FedEx and Network 2.0, we are building a simplified experience to better serve our customers with enhanced capabilities and transforming to operate with more flexibility, efficiency, and intelligence. One FedEx and Network 2.0 will leverage the strength of our networks, people, and assets in more efficient ways, enabling a distinct focus on air and international volume while facilitating a more holistic approach to how we move packages on the ground.\n\n\n \n\n\nInnovation inspired our start at FedEx 50 years ago, and it is fueling our future as we combine logistics with digital intelligence. Leveraging the capabilities of FedEx Dataworks, developments in data and technology are facilitating the execution of our DRIVE transformation by creating new opportunities to improve our operational efficiency by optimizing our existing physical capacity and staffing. See \u201cBusiness Segments\u201d below for more information. Additionally, the size and scale of our global network gives us key insights into global supply chains and trends. This foundation provides an immense amount of data we can use to build better insights, improve the customer experience, and differentiate our service offering. To fully harness the power of this data, FedEx Dataworks is focused on putting our data into context and using it to enhance the efficiency of the FedEx network and our customers\u2019 supply chains, as well as the end-to-end experience of our customers.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\u201cSafety Above All\u201d is the first and foremost value in every aspect of our business. We are committed to making our workplaces and communities safer for our team members, customers, and the public. This philosophy is embedded in our day-to-day work through rigorous policies, continual education and engagement, and investments in technology designed to prevent accidents.\n\n\n \n\n\nThrough our global transportation, information technology, and retail networks, we help to facilitate an ongoing and unprecedented expansion of customer access \u2014 to goods, services, and information. We believe it would be extremely difficult, costly, and time-consuming to replicate our global network, which reflects decades of investment, innovation, and expertise, includes the world\u2019s largest all-cargo air fleet, and connects more than 99% of the world\u2019s gross domestic product. We continue to position our company and team members to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger long-term growth, productivity, and profitability.\n\n\n \n\n\n- \n3\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDuring 2023 and early 2024, we introduced and expanded a number of innovative solutions, advanced important long-term business initiatives, and made other important investments that benefit our customers, team members, communities, and other stakeholders, including:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095    Launching DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve our long-term profitability, including Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095    Announcing one FedEx, our consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and other FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground network.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095    Expanding Picture Proof of Delivery to 90% of global residential deliveries.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095    Improving service at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground through the reopening and completion of intra-European road hubs and continued enhancements to route optimization and package handler scheduling technologies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095    Offering FedEx Consolidated Returns in the U.S., a low-priced, customer-friendly e-commerce returns option facilitated through supply chain services offered by FedEx Logistics and FedEx Office.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095    Introducing FedEx Sustainability Insights in the U.S., a cloud-based engine that harnesses scan data from our global logistics network to enhance customer access to emissions information.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095    Exceeding our FedEx Cares 50 by 50 goal of positively impacting 50 million people around the world by our 50\nth\n anniversary in April 2023.\n\n\nReputation and Responsibility\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx is one of the most trusted and respected companies in the world, and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool. Among the many reputation awards we received during 2023, FedEx ranked 18\nth  \nin \nFORTUNE\n magazine\u2019s \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Admired Companies\u201d list \u2014 the 23\nrd\n consecutive year FedEx has ranked among the top 20 in the \nFORTUNE\n Most Admired Companies list, with 15 of those years ranking among the top 10. We also retained our position as the highest ranked delivery company on the \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Admired Companies\u201d list. \nAdditionally, in 2023 Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices, named FedEx as one of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies\u00ae.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlong with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged as a great place to work. For example, in 2023 FedEx was named the 21\nst\n best workplace overall in \nFORTUNE\n magazine\u2019s list of the \u201cWorld\u2019s Best Workplaces.\u201d\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe success of our efforts is built on our sound ESG practices, which are aligned with our strategic focus. Our 2023 ESG Report is available at \nfedex.com/en-us/sustainability/reports.html\n. This report details progress toward our ESG strategies, goals, and initiatives and our approach toward industry leadership in ESG to support our strategy and values. Information in our ESG Report is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe remain committed to helping lift local economies by investing in people and communities where we live and work. In the U.S., this includes seeking diverse suppliers and strengthening our supply chain by sourcing from small, minority-, and women-owned businesses. We are also proud of our long-standing history of supporting and fostering relationships with organizations that are working to make our society more equitable and just, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Civil Rights Museum.\n \n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur Culture\n\n\n \n\n\nAt FedEx, it is our people\u2014our greatest asset\u2014that stand at the heart of our success and are the foundation of our strong reputation. Our exemplary human network defines who we are and what kind of business we want to be. Ultimately, our success depends on our people\u2019s talent, dedication, and well-being. We strive to recruit, retain, develop, and support our team members as we grow globally. \nThe Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and discusses with management our key human resource management strategies and programs, including company culture and diversity, equity, and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d).\n\n\n- \n4\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\n\nThroughout our 50-year history, the FedEx culture has driven our success. \nOur five culture values\n\u2014\ntake care of each other, commit to do good, drive business results, own outstanding, and create what\u2019s next\n\u2014unify all our operating companies and empower us to support our strategy and values. These values are grounded in our Quality Driven Management system, the Purple Promise to make every FedEx experience outstanding, and our People\u2013Service\u2013Profit philosophy, which we bring to life by:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     Prioritizing safety.\n\n\n\u0095     Taking care of our team members.\n\n\n\u0095     Embracing DEI so everyone feels appreciated and valued.\n\n\n\u0095     Delivering excellence and value for our customers and stockholders.\n\n\n\u0095     Acting with integrity in all that we do.\n\n\n\u0095     Supporting our communities.\n\n\n\u0095     Helping shape a better world.\n\n\n\u0095     Growing profitably to reinvest in our team members and business.\n\n\nUltimately, our success depends on the talent, dedication, and well-being of our people. As we grow, we strive to recruit, retain, develop, and provide advancement opportunities for our team members. We continually work to make FedEx an inclusive, equitable, and growth-focused workplace where all team members have the opportunity to flourish.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHealth and Safety\n\n\n \n\n\nOur highest priority is the well-being, health, and safety of all our employees. Our \u201cSafety Above All\u201d philosophy is the first and foremost value in every aspect of our business and is key to maintaining a successful and safe business. Our detailed safety policies, education, and technology investments are embedded into our day-to-day work and help us follow through on our commitment to make our workplaces and communities safer for our team members, customers, and communities. The Governance, Safety, and Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our safety strategies, policies, programs, and practices.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion Creates Opportunity\n \nWe believe that DEI delivers a better future for all team members, customers, suppliers, and communities. As a global business, we value the diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences of our people and recognize DEI is essential to our success and the communities we serve. DEI fosters collaboration, enables us to recruit, retain, and develop a talented workforce, and underpins our business performance and sustainability. The continued integration of DEI into our business strategies and progress towards our DEI objectives supported our ability to respond to the challenging labor market our industry faced in recent years.\n \nFedEx has a long-standing commitment to fully embrace DEI throughout our organization, from the Board of Directors to every employee. This commitment is communicated through our DEI framework and four strategic pillars: Our People; Our Education and Engagement; Our Communities, Customers, and Suppliers; and Our Story. We continue to roll out programs to ensure our people are engaged and can develop at FedEx. The FedEx Ground workforce career track program, Purple Pathways, directly targets our most diverse population, frontline managers and package handlers, to support their career growth.\n \nTo further our transparency efforts regarding our workforce composition, we report the prior year\u2019s gender, racial, and ethnic composition of our U.S. workforce by EEO-1 job category, as set forth in the consolidated EEO-1 Reports filed by FedEx and its operating subsidiaries with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. These reports can be found on our DEI webpage at \nfedex.com/en-us/about/diversity-inclusion.html\n.\n\u00a0\nQuality of Life\n \nTo support the well-being of our employees and their families, we provide the resources they need to thrive at work and at home. All eligible full- and part-time team members are equipped with competitive benefits, including healthcare, wellness, paid sick leave, other flexible paid time off, and other benefits. To ensure our benefits and compensation stay competitive, we conduct periodic peer benchmarking and internal pay equity analyses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- \n5\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAll eligible full- and part-time employees and their eligible dependents receive competitive health benefits. In the U.S., we cover approximately 70% of total eligible health and disability costs at the plan level for approximately 212,000 participating employees as of May 2023. Additionally, we offer competitive time-off that is based on feedback from our team members about what is important to them, and provide 24/7 confidential counseling services to support the mental health and well-being of our employees and their household members. We frequently communicate with employees on how to access these resources to promote their use across the enterprise, with an increased focus on mental health resources in recent years.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLearning and Development\n\n\n \n\n\nAt FedEx, we are committed to helping our team members grow and further develop their careers. We proactively evolve our operating companies\u2019 learning frameworks to meet emerging trends and align existing competencies to future capabilities and skillsets to future-proof talent needs. Our learning and development opportunities increase team member engagement, improve retention, and enhance the employee value proposition. Across the enterprise, we tailor our Core New Employee Orientation to best fit team member responsibilities in their local workplace. This onboarding experience covers topics such as safety, security, compliance, sustainability, and DEI. After orientation, the FedEx Learning Center is available with more than 25,000 online courses to enable a more efficient and convenient learning experience.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are committed to supporting team members who wish to pursue higher education in a variety of ways. The Learning inspired by FedEx (LiFE) program \u2014 a partnership between multiple FedEx operating companies and The University of Memphis\u2014offers a suite of education benefits, including tuition-free, fully online degree options for over 30 associate\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s programs of study. Eligible employees include all FedEx Express employees at all hub and airport locations in the U.S. as well as all U.S.-based FedEx Logistics and FedEx Freight employees and all Memphis-based FedEx Supply Chain employees. In 2022, we expanded the LiFE program to include all majors The University of Memphis offers online and added mentoring opportunities. We are exploring opportunities to implement similar programs outside the U.S.\n\n\n \n\n\nTalent Acquisition, Engagement, and Turnover\n\n\n \n\n\nOur recruiting practices enable us to build a talented employee base representative of the communities we serve. We continue to refine our approach to talent acquisition through technology and other human resource management strategies, leveraging technology to make our hiring process more efficient. We value feedback from our team members and provide several avenues of engagement, such as annual surveys, employee networks, and direct feedback. These methods allow us to better understand employee concerns and expectations, and results from these engagements inform our future strategies. Annually, we conduct an engagement survey to measure employee insights on our culture, engagement, and diversity.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe work to provide employees with flexible work structures. Depending on the operating company and team member responsibilities, we use a flexible work model that allows our people to work in ways that make the most sense to them. We are constantly monitoring and adjusting our strategy as we learn of new developments and use survey data at the local, national, and enterprise levels to inform our strategy.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGlobally, in 2022, we hired over 558,000 full- and part-time team members. Turnover for part-time team members, primarily package handlers at our sorting locations, was 205%, while full-time team member turnover was 32% in 2023. Turnover rates among part-time frontline workers in a number of industries are historically higher than among other employee groups. Within the ground transportation industry, many part-time workers pursue temporary employment opportunities that allow them to exit and re-enter the workforce more frequently based on their needs. These traditionally higher rates have recently been further exacerbated by the highly competitive labor market.\n\n\n \n\n\nOther Information\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of May 31, 2023, FedEx employed approximately 328,000 permanent full-time and approximately 201,000 permanent part-time employees, and FedEx Ground utilized nearly 7,000 contracted service providers.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe pilots at FedEx Express, who are a small number of its total employees, are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International (\u201cALPA\u201d) and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement that took effect on November 2, 2015. The agreement became amendable in November 2021. Bargaining for a successor agreement began in May 2021, and in November 2022 the National Mediation Board (\u201cNMB\u201d) began actively mediating the negotiations. In May 2023, FedEx Express reached a tentative successor agreement with ALPA. The tentative agreement was approved by ALPA\u2019s FedEx Express Master Executive Council in June 2023 and is being presented to FedEx Express\u2019s pilots for ratification during the first quarter of 2024. The ongoing ratification process has no effect on our operations.\n\n\n- \n6\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\n\nA small number of our other employees are members of unions. For additional information, see \u201cFedEx Express Segment\u201d and \u201cRegulation\u201d below and \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur Community\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx is committed to actively supporting the communities we serve worldwide through the strategic investment of our people, resources, and network. Through FedEx Cares, our global community engagement program, we support non-profit organizations working to solve social challenges relevant to our business, customers, and team members. We pair donations with charitable shipping and access to our global network, team member volunteers, subject matter expertise, influence, and connections to meet social and business goals. We make our biggest investments in areas where we can address significant issues and apply our unique business capabilities. Real change takes significant investment, authentic support for communities, and a commitment to continuous learning. FedEx Cares focuses on three major giving pillars:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095   \nDelivering for Good\n: Lending our global network and unparalleled logistics expertise to organizations with mission-critical needs in times of disaster and helping communities heal, learn, and thrive.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095    \nGlobal Entrepreneurship\n: Advancing women and minority-owned small businesses globally through training and increased access to resources, capital, and new markets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095    \nSustainable Logistics\n: Accelerating process innovations such as public transportation and technological innovations such as natural carbon capture and clean energy to reduce the environmental impact of the logistics industry.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, our commitments to DEI and team member volunteerism are foundational to FedEx Cares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 2023 we exceeded our FedEx Cares 50 by 50 goal of positively impacting 50 million people around the world by our 50\nth\n anniversary in April 2023. We also launched a \u201c50 Days of Caring\u201d initiative leading up to the anniversary during which FedEx team members gave back to their communities through service projects around the world and created the FedEx Founder\u2019s Fund \u2014 a philanthropic endowment honoring Frederick W. Smith and his legacy as a business leader and changemaker in communities around the world. Additionally, FedEx supports communities throughout the U.S. with its FedEx Cares Employee Giving program.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe the investments we make in our communities today, combined with team member engagement, set the stage for a brighter tomorrow. For additional information on our community involvement and our FedEx Cares strategy, visit \nfedexcares.com\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Environment\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur \u201cPractical Sustainability\u201d philosophy and \u201cReduce, Replace, Revolutionize\u201d approach guide our sustainability strategy. At FedEx, we recognize our business\u2019s effect on the environment and communities we serve, including greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) criteria air pollutant emissions, noise pollution, and waste generation from packaging, and remain steadfast in our commitment to minimize these impacts. We are also cognizant of the effect climate change could have on our business operations. In our business planning and strategy, we consider events such as intensified weather, GHG emissions regulations, increased media and investor attention, and enhanced customer demands to address environmental challenges. FedEx has 50 years of experience proactively addressing unexpected situations, such as severe weather events, and we maintain system flexibility to minimize impacts on our customers. While climate change poses a strategic risk to our business and stakeholders, we recognize the opportunities it simultaneously creates around sustainable products and services that advance our customers\u2019 environmental goals.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe align our assessment and reporting approach with the recommendations from the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Our approach is informed by the climate-related physical and transition risks we identify through our enterprise risk management process. Climate change-related risks and opportunities are assessed as part of our annual risk assessment process, and we continue to closely monitor public attitudes, geopolitical concerns, and global regulations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 2021 we announced our goal to achieve carbon neutrality by calendar 2040 across our global operations\u2019 Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and our Scope 3 contracted transportation emissions. To help reach this goal, we designated $2.0 billion of initial investment towards vehicle electrification, sustainable energy, and carbon sequestration, including a pledge of $100 million to Yale University to help establish the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture. In addition, we continue to leverage other approaches to reduce aircraft and vehicle emissions, such as increased interline usage at FedEx Express and intermodal rail usage at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- \n7\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nVehicle Electrification\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nElectrifying a substantial portion of our global fleet of motorized vehicles is a crucial component of our path to carbon-neutral operations. We plan to transition the entire FedEx parcel pickup-and-delivery fleet to zero-tailpipe emissions electric vehicles by calendar 2040, using a phased approach to replace existing vehicles. For example, by calendar 2025, we expect 50% of FedEx Express global pickup-and-delivery vehicle purchases will be electric, rising to 100% of all purchases by calendar 2030, subject to availability.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Express continues to expand its electric vehicle fleet through its relationship with General Motors\u2019 BrightDrop, and has taken delivery of 500 BrightDrop electric vehicles as of June 2023. FedEx Ground is developing a comprehensive strategy to facilitate the electric vehicle transition for our independent service providers, and is implementing the necessary infrastructure at our facilities to provide charging solutions. Additionally, FedEx Freight is evaluating electric vehicle opportunities to define scalable solutions for its entire fleet.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are actively building the innovative charging infrastructure required to support our growing fleet of electric vehicles across our vast network of facilities, and continue to electrify forklifts, airport ground service equipment, and other non-road vehicles across our operating companies to reduce fuel and maintenance costs. We understand that challenges remain, including electric vehicle availability, electrification of certain vehicle classes due to operational needs, legislative changes, grid capacity, and certain operating conditions. For more information, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFleet efficiency enables ongoing fuel, emissions, and cost reductions as the industry works to address these challenges. FedEx Express has established a goal to increase vehicle fleet efficiency by 50% from a 2005 baseline by calendar 2025. Through 2022, our efforts collectively resulted in a 40% improvement in FedEx Express vehicle fleet efficiency from our 2005 baseline.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSustainable Fuels\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo reduce aircraft and vehicle emissions, we continue to pursue viable, cost-effective alternative fuels. Our global fleet of over 6,200 alternative fuel vehicles includes hybrid, electric, liquified or compressed natural gas, liquified petroleum gas, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and we will continue to grow our alternative fuel fleet in the coming years, subject to availability. Decarbonizing heavyweight transportation is more challenging than parcel pickup-and-delivery vehicles due to the required mileage range and the time needed to refuel or charge. We continue to explore alternative fuels for certain vehicles not easily electrifiable.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have also established a goal of obtaining 30% of our annual jet fuel usage from blends of alternative fuels by calendar 2030. The U.S. government has passed legislation in recent years to incentivize production, and the EU recently adopted legislation implementing sustainable aviation fuel mandates. We understand the challenges the industry faces in deploying sustainable aviation fuel at scale and recognize other solutions may be needed to help the aviation industry improve efficiency and reduce emissions. To help accelerate solutions, we are members of the First Movers Coalition, participating in the Aviation Sector working group, a global initiative working to decarbonize hard-to-abate industrial sectors, including the aviation industry.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAircraft Fuel Conservation and Fleet Modernization\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe continuously work to reduce the environmental impact of our aircraft fleet. Since 2005, we reduced our overall aircraft emissions intensity by 28%, primarily due to our ongoing FedEx Fuel Sense and aircraft modernization initiatives. Our global FedEx Fuel Sense program, which accounted for 13 million gallons of jet fuel savings in 2022, enables us to reduce the cost of fuel use and associated GHG emissions.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, our commitment to modernizing our aircraft fleet lowers costs, enhances reliability and operational adaptability, improves fuel efficiency, and reduces emissions intensity. During 2023, we retired our MD-10-30 fleet and accelerated the retirement of our MD-11 fleet to the end of 2028. See the \u201cResults of Operations and Outlook \u2014 Consolidated Results \u2014 Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges\u201d section of \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report for more information on aircraft retirements during 2023.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe took delivery of two Boeing 777 Freighter (\u201cB777F\u201d) aircraft in 2023, and plan to deploy an additional six B777F aircraft during 2024 and 2025. Similarly, we took delivery of 14 Boeing 767-300 Freighter (\u201cB767F\u201d) aircraft in 2023, and plan to deploy an additional 24 B767F aircraft during 2024 and 2025. Delays could impact these timelines. We also continue to deploy new ATR 72-600F aircraft for shorter feeder routes to replace our aging ATR-42 aircraft and Cessna SkyCourier 408 cargo aircraft to help reduce the number of planes needed per feeder route and further improve our fuel efficiency. For more information about our expected future aircraft deliveries, see \u201cItem 2. Properties\u201d of this Annual Report under the caption \u201cFedEx Express Segment\u201d and Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- \n8\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFacilities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe aim to continuously improve the sustainability, reduce the environmental impact, and increase the efficiency of our more than 5,000 air and ground hubs, local stations, freight service centers, and retail locations. While our energy demand is increasing to support electric vehicle deployment and charging infrastructure, we have increased our focus on facility energy management and off-site renewable energy procurement strategies to overcome this challenge. Energy management systems are essential to increasing efficiency at our facilities through monitoring, regulating, and optimizing our lighting, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning equipment. In 2022, we generated on- and off-site solar energy at 29 locations across our operating companies.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe adopt the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (\u201cLEED\u201d) standard in the U.S. and the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (\u201cBREEAM\u201d) in Europe to guide efficient facility design when appropriate. FedEx Express and FedEx Freight seek LEED certification on all new construction, and in total FedEx has 44 LEED-certified facilities and 13 BREEAM-certified facilities across our operating companies.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo reduce our operational waste footprint, we implement waste and recycling management processes in the U.S. We prioritize reducing our waste generation and recycling the waste we do produce.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSustainable Customer Solutions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx works to minimize packaging materials, optimize customer package size and weight, increase shipping efficiency, and maximize recyclability to reduce the environmental impacts of packaging materials and transporting goods. We offer end-to-end sustainability for customers by supplying sustainable packaging solutions and exploring carbon-neutral shipping opportunities. FedEx-branded cardboard packaging is 100% recyclable and contains an average of 36% recycled content. During 2022, 64% of FedEx-branded packaging was third-party certified and all paper purchased by FedEx Office was from vendors with responsible forest-management practices.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 2023, we introduced the FedEx Sustainability Insights tool in the U.S., which built upon our previous Customer Emissions Calculator, to increase accessibility for our customers and suppliers to estimate CO\n2\ne shipping emissions at package and account levels. Created by FedEx Dataworks, this cloud-based engine uses near-real time FedEx network data to estimate CO\n2\ne emissions for both individual tracking numbers and \nfedex.com \naccounts. Users can view historical emissions data by account as well as search by tracking number with their \nfedex.com\n login.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor additional information on the ways we are minimizing our impact on the environment, see \nfedex.com/en-us/sustainability.html\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGovernance\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe FedEx Board of Directors is comprised of a majority of independent directors and is committed to the highest quality corporate governance and accountability to stockholders. Our Board of Directors periodically reviews all aspects of our governance policies and practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines (the \u201cGuidelines\u201d) and our Code of Conduct, in light of best practices and makes whatever changes it deems appropriate to further our longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance. The Guidelines and the Code of Conduct, which apply to all of our directors, officers, and employees, including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers, are available under the ESG heading under \u201cGovernance\u201d on the Investor Relations page of our website at \ninvestors.fedex.com\n. We will post under the ESG heading on the Investor Relations page of our website information regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, the provisions of the Code of Conduct to the extent such disclosure is required.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBusiness Segments\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following describes in more detail the operations of each of our principal operating segments:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Express Segment\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Express\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOverview\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Express invented express distribution 50 years ago in 1973 and remains the industry leader, providing rapid, reliable, time-definite delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through an integrated global network.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n- \n9\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight, connecting markets that generate more than 99% of the world\u2019s gross domestic product through door-to-door, customs-cleared service, historically with a money-back guarantee. As of July 13, 2023, the money-back guarantee remains suspended for certain FedEx Express services in order to balance our focus on service and safety. FedEx Express\u2019s unmatched air route authorities and extensive transportation infrastructure, combined with leading-edge information technologies, make it the world\u2019s largest express transportation company. As of May 31, 2023, FedEx Express employed approximately 245,000 employees and had approximately 70,000 drop-off locations (including FedEx Office stores and FedEx OnSite locations, such as nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores), 700 aircraft, and more than 82,000 vehicles in its global network.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Express also provides time-critical shipment services through FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. (\u201cFedEx Custom Critical\u201d) and cross-border enablement and technology solutions and e-commerce transportation solutions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nServices\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight. FedEx Express offers three U.S. domestic overnight package delivery services: FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight, and FedEx Standard Overnight. FedEx SameDay service is available 365 days a year throughout all 50 states for urgent shipments up to 150 pounds. FedEx Express also offers U.S. express overnight and deferred freight services to handle the needs of the time-definite freight market.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInternational express and deferred package delivery is available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of time-definite services to meet distinct customer needs. FedEx International Economy provides time-definite delivery typically in two to five business days. FedEx International First provides time-definite delivery to select postal codes in more than 25 countries and territories, with delivery to select U.S. ZIP Codes as early as 8:00 a.m. from more than 90 countries and Caribbean islands in one or two business days, delivery by 10:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Canada, and by 11:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Mexico. FedEx Express also offers domestic pickup-and-delivery services within certain non-U.S. countries, including France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Poland, India, China, and South Africa. In addition, FedEx Express offers comprehensive international express and deferred freight services, real-time tracking, and advanced customs clearance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur FedEx International Priority service provides end-of-day time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 220 countries and territories, and our FedEx International Priority Express service provides midday time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 25 countries and territories. Additionally, FedEx International Connect Plus, a contractual e-commerce service currently available from nearly 60 origin countries to over 195 destination countries, provides day-definite delivery typically within two to five business days.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor information regarding FedEx Express e-commerce tools and solutions, such as FedEx Delivery Manager and FedEx Returns Technology, see \u201cFedEx Services Segment \u2014 Customer-Driven Technology \u2014 E-Commerce Solutions.\u201d\n \n\n\nInternational Expansion\n \n\n\nOver the years, FedEx Express has added capabilities in important international markets that have given us more robust transportation networks. Our 2016 acquisition of TNT Express accelerated our European and global growth; substantially enhanced our global footprint through TNT Express\u2019s lower-cost road networks in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia; and expanded our capabilities and solutions for our customers. The completion of the physical network integration of TNT Express into FedEx Express in 2022 and consolidation of flights into our Paris hub allow us to significantly improve operational efficiency, and the reopening and completion of central European road hubs in Duiven, The Netherlands and Novara, Italy in 2023 have improved our intra-European service.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe also have expanded our capabilities in the Asia-Pacific markets, including through the establishment of our Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in southern China; our North Pacific regional hub at the Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan, which serves as a consolidation point for shipments from northern Asia to the U.S.; and our International Express and Cargo Hub in Shanghai at Shanghai\u2019s Pudong International Airport. During 2020, we added 14 new Asia-Pacific origin markets for FedEx International First service to the U.S. and Canada. These developments allow us to continue to better serve our global customers doing business in the Asia-Pacific markets. In 2022, FedEx Express entered into a strategic alliance with Delhivery, a leading logistics and supply chain services company in India.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo facilitate the use of our growing international network, we offer a full range of international trade consulting services and a variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- \n10\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nU.S. Postal Service Agreement\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPursuant to an agreement with the U.S. Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d) that expires on September 29, 2024, FedEx Express provides airport-to-airport transportation of USPS First Class Mail, Priority Mail Express, and Priority Mail within the U.S. FedEx Express also provides transportation and delivery for the USPS\u2019s international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed under a separate agreement. For more information about our relationship with the USPS, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPricing\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Express periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guides. In general, shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. Effective January 2, 2023, FedEx Express implemented a 6.9% average list price increase for U.S. domestic, U.S. export, and U.S. import services.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn order to manage demand and capacity constraints in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, between April 2020 and November 2020 FedEx Express implemented temporary surcharges on all international package and airfreight shipments. These surcharges continued as peak surcharges beginning in November 2020 and remain in effect. Additionally, beginning in June 2020 FedEx Express has implemented a series of peak surcharges generally applying to U.S. domestic shipments that are oversized or require additional handling, and to residential packages for customers meeting a certain volume threshold. Specific applicable surcharges have been adjusted periodically since their implementation, and higher surcharges were applied during the 2023 holiday peak season. Effective January 16, 2023, the U.S. domestic holiday peak surcharges were no longer in effect for residential shipments, and peak surcharges for shipments that are oversized or require additional handling were adjusted downward.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally, where legally and contractually possible. FedEx Express fuel surcharges are adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from ten days prior to the week in which it is assessed. Effective April 4, 2022, the tables used to determine U.S. domestic fuel surcharges at FedEx Express were updated. Effective January 30, 2023, the tables used to determine certain international fuel surcharges at FedEx Express were updated.

Properties\u201d of this Annual Report under the caption \u201cFedEx Express Segment.\u201d\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn connection with our DRIVE initiatives and through collaborations with FedEx Dataworks, we are transforming and optimizing the FedEx Express network to be more agile and efficient, including through the deployment of digital assets that allow us to more effectively balance the use of FedEx aircraft and Global Service Participants and implementation of a single daily dispatch of couriers within the U.S. domestic network.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- \n11\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Express shipping services at all of its retail locations. FedEx Express also has alliances with certain other retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites, including at nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores. Our unstaffed FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings, shopping centers, and corporate or industrial parks.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFuel Supplies and Costs\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDuring 2023, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for estimated amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices. We do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts. See \u201cPricing\u201d above.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following table sets forth FedEx Express\u2019s costs for jet fuel and its percentage of FedEx Corporation consolidated revenues for the last five fiscal years:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal Year\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTotal Jet\nFuel Cost\n(in millions)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPercentage of Consolidated\nRevenue\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,515\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3,867\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,065\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,265\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,847\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMost of FedEx Express\u2019s vehicle fuel needs are satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCompetition\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs described in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report, the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency, reliability, capacity and speed of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, innovative service offerings, and the fit within the customer\u2019s overall supply chain.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCompetitors within the U.S. include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. (\u201cUPS\u201d), passenger airlines offering express package services, regional delivery companies, air freight forwarders, and the USPS. FedEx Express\u2019s principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, DPD (a subsidiary of France\u2019s La Poste\u2019s GeoPost), General Logistics Systems (a Royal Mail-owned parcel delivery group), foreign postal authorities, passenger airlines, air freight forwarders, regional carriers, and all-cargo airlines. FedEx Express also competes with startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers, such as Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, and may be considered competitors. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. Many of FedEx Express\u2019s international competitors are government-owned, -controlled, or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity, and more favorable operating conditions than FedEx Express. For more information, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmployees\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nJohn A. Smith is the President and Chief Executive Officer \u2014 U.S. and Canada Ground Operations of FedEx Express and Richard W. Smith is the President and Chief Executive Officer \u2014 Airline and International of FedEx Express. As of May 31, 2023, FedEx Express employed approximately 188,000 permanent full-time and approximately 56,000 permanent part-time employees.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe pilots of FedEx Express, who are a small number of its total employees, are represented by ALPA and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement that took effect in November 2015. The collective bargaining agreement became amendable in November 2021. Bargaining for a successor agreement began in May 2021, and in November 2022 the NMB began actively mediating the negotiations. In May 2023, FedEx Express reached a tentative successor agreement with ALPA. The tentative agreement was approved by ALPA\u2019s FedEx Express Master Executive Council in June 2023 and is being presented to FedEx Express\u2019s pilots for ratification during the first quarter of 2024. The ongoing ratification process has no effect on our operations.\n\n\n \n\n\n- \n12\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to our pilots at FedEx Express, certain of FedEx Express\u2019s non-U.S. employees are unionized. In June 2022, the Transport Workers Union filed an application with the NMB requesting an election to represent approximately 130 Global Operations Control (\u201cGOC\u201d) specialists who perform flight dispatching functions in FedEx Express\u2019s GOC center. The NMB dismissed the application in December 2022. FedEx Express believes its employee relations are excellent. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report for more information.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Custom Critical\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Custom Critical provides a range of expedited, time-specific freight-shipping services throughout the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Among its services are Surface Expedite, providing exclusive-use shipping and time-definite services; Air Expedite, offering an array of expedited air solutions to meet customers\u2019 critical delivery times; and White Glove Services, for shipments that require extra care in handling, temperature control, or specialized security. Service from FedEx Custom Critical is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. FedEx Custom Critical continuously monitors shipments through an integrated proprietary shipment-control system, including two-way satellite communications on exclusive-use shipments.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Ground Segment\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBy leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low-cost structure, and efficiently using information technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx Ground continues to enhance its competitive position as a leading provider of business and residential ground package delivery services. As of July 13, 2023, the money-back guarantee for all FedEx Ground services remains suspended in order to balance our focus on service and safety. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market, focusing on business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground service is provided to 100% of the continental U.S. population and overnight service of up to 400 miles to nearly 100% of the continental U.S. population. Service is also provided to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Alaska and Hawaii through a ground and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers. FedEx Ground provides seven-day-per-week residential delivery to more than half of the U.S. population. See \u201cOne FedEx and Network 2.0\u201d above for information regarding the transition of all FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to FedEx Express beginning in April 2024.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe company offers FedEx Home Delivery service, which reaches 100% of U.S. residences. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated to meeting the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment, and signature delivery. Sunday delivery is provided for more than half of the U.S. population. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and their customers and is the first residential ground package delivery service to have offered a money-back guarantee. FedEx Ground Economy service is available for the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages to any residential address or PO Box in the U.S.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPricing\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Ground periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guide. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. Effective January 2, 2023, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery implemented a 6.9% average list price increase. FedEx Ground Economy average list prices also increased.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo manage demand and capacity constraints in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in June 2020 FedEx Ground implemented a series of surcharges generally applying to shipments that are oversized, unauthorized, or require additional handling; to residential packages for customers meeting a certain volume threshold; and to FedEx Ground Economy shipments. Specific applicable surcharges have been adjusted periodically since their implementation, and higher surcharges were applied during the 2023 holiday peak season. Effective January 16, 2023, the holiday peak surcharges were no longer in effect for residential shipments, and peak surcharges for shipments that are oversized or require additional handling were adjusted downward.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two weeks prior to the week in which it is assessed. Effective April 4, 2022, the tables used to determine fuel surcharges at FedEx Ground were updated. See the \u201cResults of Operations and Outlook \u2014 Consolidated Results \u2014 Fuel\u201d section of \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report for more information.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- \n13\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOperations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Ground operates a highly flexible network of over 700 sortation and distribution facilities, including more than 160 fully automated stations, in the U.S. and Canada as of May 31, 2023. FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with more than 100,000 vehicles owned or leased by independent service providers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service and FedEx Ground Economy service, FedEx Ground leverages its pickup operation and hub and linehaul network.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFollowing a network expansion in recent years that substantially increased FedEx Ground\u2019s daily capacity through the addition of new facilities featuring the latest automated sorting technology as well as the expansion or relocation of existing hubs and other facilities, in 2023 the company rationalized its operations in response to lower volumes by consolidating sorts and cancelling several planned network capacity projects, continuing to manage staffing levels effectively, and reducing Sunday delivery operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Ground continues to leverage opportunities to maximize utilization of existing facilities and deploy new technologies to enhance operational efficiency. Advanced automated unloading and sorting technology is used to streamline the handling of millions of packages daily. FedEx Ground yard management systems, which interact with GPS tags on each trailer and create geofences around FedEx Ground facilities, automatically notify the control center when a trailer arrives and departs. Using overhead laser and six-sided camera-based bar code scan technology, hub conveyors electronically guide packages to their appropriate destination chute, where they are loaded for transport to their respective destination stations for local delivery.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThrough collaboration with FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Ground is implementing dynamic scheduling tools to match sort staffing headcount with volumes and is introducing capabilities to allow certain packages to bypass station sortation and proceed directly to vehicles, which helps to maximize station capacity. Dock modernization efforts enabled by FedEx Dataworks, including a new network operating plan that uses machine learning and algorithms to develop more detailed and accurate volume forecasts, are enhancing productivity at FedEx Ground in furtherance of our DRIVE initiatives. Additionally, the company is testing autonomous, driverless technologies in the handling of large, non-conveyable packages, as well as artificial intelligence-enabled robotic product sortation systems to sort small packages.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvanced route optimization technology leveraging the capabilities of FedEx Dataworks provides service providers near real-time data that can be used to plan efficient delivery routes and make decisions about vehicle mix and workforce. Additionally, software systems and internet-based applications are deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal package data with external delivery information. FedEx Ground provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature functionality through the FedEx website, \nfedex.com\n. For additional information regarding FedEx Ground e-commerce tools and solutions, including FedEx Delivery Manager and FedEx Returns Technology, see \u201cFedEx Services Segment \u2014 Customer-Driven Technology \u2014 E-Commerce Solutions.\u201d\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Ground has introduced new vehicle safety technologies and incentives for adoption by its service providers, as well as new eligibility standards for drivers employed by service providers. Additionally, FedEx Ground has made significant operational enhancements to ensure safe and reliable handling of large and heavy items. These changes include designing new facilities, adding equipment to certain facilities, and making other operational adjustments.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Ground shipping services at all of its retail locations. FedEx Ground is also available as a service option at all FedEx Authorized ShipCenters and other FedEx OnSite locations, including at nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of May 31, 2023, FedEx Ground employed approximately 56,000 permanent full-time and approximately 136,000 permanent part-time employees. In addition, FedEx Ground contracts with nearly 7,000 independent small businesses to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, as the use of these service providers is well suited to the needs of the ground delivery business and its customers.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Ground is defending lawsuits in which it is alleged that FedEx Ground should be treated as an employer or joint employer of drivers employed by service providers engaged by FedEx Ground. We continue to believe that FedEx Ground is not an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these independent businesses. The status of the drivers employed by these service providers could be further challenged in connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan. For a description of these proceedings, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report and Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- \n14\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nScott L. Ray is the President of FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is headquartered in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, and its primary competitors are UPS, the USPS, and regional delivery carriers. FedEx Ground also competes with startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers, such as Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. For more information, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Freight Segment\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Freight is a leading North American provider of LTL freight services, offering choice, simplicity, and reliability to meet the needs of LTL shippers \u2014 FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet a customer\u2019s supply chain needs; FedEx Freight Economy, when a customer can trade time for cost savings; and FedEx Freight Direct, a service to meet the needs of the growing e-commerce market for delivery of big and bulky products to or through the door for residences and businesses. Through one comprehensive network of service centers and advanced information systems, FedEx Freight provides service to virtually every U.S. ZIP Code (including Alaska and Hawaii) with industry-leading transit times. FedEx Freight Priority has the fastest published transit times of any nationwide LTL service. Internationally, FedEx Freight Canada offers FedEx Freight Priority service, serving most points in Canada, as well as FedEx Freight Priority and FedEx Freight Economy service between Canada and the U.S. In addition, FedEx Freight serves Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands via alliances. As of July 13, 2023, the money-back guarantee for all FedEx Freight services remains suspended in order to balance our focus on service and safety.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThrough its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can match customers\u2019 time-critical needs with industry-leading transit times. With the expansion of FedEx electronic solutions, LTL shippers have the convenience of a single shipping and tracking solution for FedEx Freight, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. These solutions make freight shipping easier and provide customers easy access to their account information. The FedEx Freight Advance Notice feature available on FedEx Freight Priority shipments uses the company\u2019s innovative technology systems to proactively notify FedEx Freight customers via the internet, e-mail, or fax when a shipment may be delayed beyond its estimated delivery date, providing customers with greater visibility and control of their LTL freight shipments. Customers can also process cross-border LTL shipments to and from Canada and Mexico, as well as intra-Canada and -Mexico shipments, through FedEx Ship Manager at \nfedex.com\n, FedEx Ship Manager Software, FedEx Ship Manager Server, and FedEx Web Services. Additionally, FedEx Freight A.M. Delivery offers freight delivery by 10:30 a.m. within and between the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Freight also offers LTL Select, a free cloud-based, multi-carrier transportation management system that provides customers with visibility into all available carriers and their pricing in one location, as well as the ability to book service and make payments. FedEx Freight uses radio frequency identification technology and customized software to improve shipment visibility on its docks and enhance custodial control at the handling unit level.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Freight Direct addresses the growing e-commerce market for big and bulky products. It has four delivery service levels to meet customer needs, with basic and basic by appointment to-the-door services available to nearly 100% of the U.S. population and standard and premium through-the-door services available to 90% of the continental U.S. population, as well as flexible delivery windows, end-to-end visibility, proactive notifications, and returns services with flexible pickup windows and label-less options.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of May 31, 2023, the FedEx Freight segment was operating nearly 30,000 vehicles from a network of approximately 390 service centers and had approximately 43,000 employees. The company plans to close and consolidate approximately 30 locations in the first quarter of 2024, and conducted several rounds of furloughs to match staffing with volume levels in 2023. Lance D. Moll is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Freight, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. FedEx Freight\u2019s primary competitors are YRC Worldwide Inc. (which includes YRC Regional Transportation and YRC Freight), XPO Logistics, Inc., Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., ABF Freight (an ArcBest company), SAIA, Inc., and TFI International Inc.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are currently bargaining with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at one FedEx Freight facility.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPricing\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Freight periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its 100 Rules Tariff. In general, shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, class, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. On January 2, 2023, FedEx Freight implemented a 6.9% average list price increase for customers who use FXF PZONE and FXF EZONE rates and a 7.9% average list price increase for customers who use FXF 1000 and FXF 501. These increases apply for shipments within the U.S. and between the contiguous U.S. and Canada.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- \n15\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn order to manage demand and capacity constraints, beginning in July 2021 FedEx Freight implemented a peak surcharge applying to specific delivery points within the U.S. The peak surcharge has been adjusted periodically since implementation. Effective November 15, 2021, FedEx Freight increased applicable length surcharges. Effective January 17, 2022, FedEx Freight added a surcharge that applies when a pickup is performed and no shipment is tendered to the carrier. Effective January 16, 2023, FedEx Freight changed the extreme length surcharge to a tier-based length structure. The company continues to explore ways to modernize freight pricing including through dimension-in-motion technology, which more accurately captures freight profile and improves its ability to cost and price shipments.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Freight has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two days prior to the day in which it is assessed. Effective April 4, 2022, the tables used to determine fuel surcharges at FedEx Freight were updated.

Through FedEx Services, we provide a convenient single point of access for many customer support functions, enabling us to more effectively sell the entire portfolio of transportation services and to help ensure a consistent and outstanding experience for our customers.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBrie A. Carere and Robert B. Carter each serve as the Co-President and Co-Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Services, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2023, the FedEx Services segment had approximately 15,000 employees.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCustomer-Driven Technology\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx is a world leader in technology, and FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith\u2019s vision that \u201cthe information about a package is as important as the delivery of the package itself\u201d remains at the core of our comprehensive technology strategy. We strive to build technology solutions that will solve our customers\u2019 business problems with simplicity, convenience, speed, and reliability. Additionally, FedEx stands at the nexus of digital and physical networks, a crucial intersection for the success of e-commerce deliveries. We continue to expand our e-commerce convenience network and explore innovative alternatives to help customers and businesses deliver. During 2023 we continued to advance a major information technology transition from traditional mainframe computing to cloud-based systems, which is delivering significant benefits in terms of flexibility, security, speed to market, and resiliency. See \u201cFedEx Dataworks Operating Segment\u201d below for more information on the solutions we are creating to \u201cInnovate for Tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShipping Management and Precision Tracking\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe \nfedex.com\n website is widely recognized for its speed, ease of use, and customer-focused features. The advanced tracking capability within FedEx Tracking provides customers with a consolidated view of inbound and outbound shipments. Additionally, an advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence model developed by FedEx Dataworks has enhanced tracking capabilities on \nfedex.com, \ndelivering greater estimated delivery date accuracy, including updates for early or delayed shipments. FedEx Virtual Assistant on \nfedex.com \nis an artificial-intelligence-enabled service that provides answers to customer shipping questions, allowing our customer service representatives and sales professionals to focus on higher-value customer interactions.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSenseAware, a FedEx innovation currently available in 135 countries worldwide, allows customers to stay connected to their critical shipments by providing real-time updates regarding current location, precise temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure readings, light exposure, and shock events. Additionally, FedEx SenseAware ID is a lightweight sensor-based logistics device that delivers a new level of precision tracking. The enhanced location visibility provided by FedEx SenseAware ID is creating opportunities for FedEx customers to reimagine their supply chains through real-time updates on a package\u2019s location within the FedEx Express network. FedEx is currently expanding access to FedEx SenseAware ID and plans to eventually make FedEx SenseAware ID available for a broad range of premium FedEx Express services.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Mobile is a suite of solutions including the FedEx mobile application, FedEx mobile website, and SMS text messaging. The FedEx Mobile app provides convenience for recipients to track packages and access FedEx Delivery Manager to customize home deliveries. Shippers can easily get rates and estimated delivery times and swiftly create a shipping label. All users can quickly find the nearest FedEx location for Hold at Location or drop-off. It is available on Android\u0099 and Apple devices. The FedEx Mobile app has expanded to more than 220 countries and territories and 40 languages. SMS Notifications allows customers to track or follow a package via text messaging, and it is currently available in five countries.\n \n\n\n- \n16\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, our FedEx Ship Manager suite of solutions, which was modernized in 2023, offers a wide range of options to help our customers manage their parcel and LTL shipping and associated processes.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nE-Commerce Solutions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Delivery Manager allows our U.S. residential customers to customize home deliveries to fit their schedule by providing a range of options to schedule dates, locations, and times of delivery. Additionally, FedEx Returns Technology, a comprehensive solution for returns management, provides high-volume merchants and e-tailers complete visibility into returns and an easy way to track shipments, manage inventory, analyze returns trends, and make more informed decisions based on shoppers\u2019 returns behaviors. In 2023 we launched FedEx Consolidated Returns in the U.S., a low-priced, easy e-commerce solution for low-weight returns facilitated through supply chain services offered by FedEx Logistics and FedEx Office. Through FedEx Consolidated Returns, shoppers who purchased from participating merchants can drop off the items they wish to return with no box or label required at approximately 2,000 FedEx Office locations. The returned items will then be consolidated with other returns and processed through FedEx Logistics and sent back to the merchants via a less-than-truckload option.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx OnSite, our retail convenience network, utilizes third-party retailers to receive and hold packages for FedEx customers. The FedEx OnSite network has grown to include nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores in addition to our approximately 2,000 FedEx Office locations. In addition to allowing for an easy returns and drop-off experience for shoppers, the FedEx OnSite network is well positioned to serve as a \u201cbuy online, pickup in store\u201d network for small and medium merchants without brick-and-mortar locations. We have also added FedEx Returns Technology to the Walgreens retail network, which allows for in-store printing of return shipping labels and eliminates the need to include a return label in every package.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have expanded e-commerce delivery options for retailers with FedEx Extra Hours, a service that enables participating retailers to fulfill e-commerce orders into the evening and receive late pickups by FedEx Express, with next-day local delivery and two-day shipping to any address in the continental U.S. FedEx Extra Hours, which is currently available to select customers, allows retailers to extend evening order cutoff times by five to eight hours, with some as late as midnight, depending on their current order fulfillment process.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn June 2022, FedEx announced the launch of Picture Proof of Delivery for express and ground residential deliveries in the U.S. and Canada that are released without a signature. The capability has expanded to 90% of global residential deliveries.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThrough innovative partnerships, FedEx Dataworks seeks to open pathways to e-commerce and empower customers with differentiated insights and tools. In 2021, we announced a multi-year collaboration with Adobe, starting with the integration of ShopRunner with Adobe Commerce\u2019s Magento platform. By integrating their online storefronts with ShopRunner, Adobe merchants are able to offer seamless checkout, two-day shipping, easy returns, and exclusive offers to shippers. The collaboration also gives merchants access to FedEx post-purchase logistics intelligence, allowing for better management of supply chains. In 2022, we announced a multi-year partnership with Salesforce that integrates Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Salesforce Order Management with innovative capabilities from FedEx and ShopRunner. In January 2022, FedEx and Microsoft announced a new cross-platform logistics solution for e-commerce aimed at increasing merchant competitiveness in the e-commerce space by improving customer engagement and providing enhanced shipping options, which was made available to customers in the U.S. in 2023. Additionally, in June 2022 FedEx and FourKites announced a strategic alliance to provide businesses with new, more robust real-time supply chain visibility capabilities. In November 2022, we announced a strategic alliance with Cart.com to create integrated solutions that help address some of the biggest e-commerce challenges.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAutonomous Solutions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx is exploring the use of autonomous delivery technology within its operations. In 2022, we announced a multi-year, multi-phase agreement to test Nuro\u2019s next-generation autonomous delivery vehicle within FedEx operations. The collaboration with Nuro will explore various use cases for on-road autonomous vehicle logistics such as multi-stop and appointment-based deliveries.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 2022, we began a pilot program with Aurora Innovation, Inc. (\u201cAurora\u201d) and PACCAR Inc. to test Aurora\u2019s autonomous driving technology in PACCAR autonomous vehicle platform-equipped trucks within FedEx linehaul operations. Additionally, FedEx Express is developing plans to test Elroy Air\u2019s autonomous air cargo system within the company\u2019s middle-mile logistics operations, moving shipments between sortation locations. We are also working with major national retailers, fast food restaurants, and drug stores to help assess different customers\u2019 autonomous delivery needs. In 2023, FedEx ended the research and development program for Roxo, the FedEx SameDay Bot, to prioritize these other nearer-term opportunities.\n\n\n- \n17\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMarketing\n\n\nThe FedEx brand name symbolizes outstanding service, reliability, and speed. Emphasis is continually placed on promoting and protecting the FedEx brand, one of our most important assets. As a result, FedEx is one of the most widely recognized brands in the world. In addition to television, print, and digital advertising, we promote the FedEx brand through sponsorships and special events. For example, FedEx sponsors:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     The UEFA Champions League, which is broadcast in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     The season-long FedExCup competition on the PGA Tour, and the FedEx St. Jude Championship, a PGA Tour event that has raised millions of dollars for St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital and is one of three annual FedExCup playoff events.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     The #11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota Camry driven by Denny Hamlin in the NASCAR Cup Series.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, FedEx is the \u201cOfficial Delivery Service Sponsor\u201d and \u201cOfficial Office Services Provider\u201d of the NFL, through which we conduct events and other activities to promote the FedEx brand, such as the \u201cFedEx Air & Ground\u201d NFL Players of the Week and Players of the Year Awards.\n\n\nInformation Security\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Services has a team of highly qualified professionals dedicated to securing information about our customers\u2019 shipments and protecting our customers\u2019, vendors\u2019, and employees\u2019 privacy, and we strive to provide a safe, secure online environment for our customers. We are committed to compliance with applicable information security laws, regulations, and industry standards. For a description of risks related to information security, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Dataworks Operating Segment\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe FedEx Dataworks operating segment is focused on putting our data into context and using it to enhance the efficiency of the FedEx network and our customers\u2019 supply chains, as well as the end-to-end experience of our customers. The size and scale of our global network gives us a bird\u2019s-eye view of global supply chains and trends and provides an immense amount of data. As the digital twin of our physical network and a key enabler of our DRIVE transformation, FedEx Dataworks leverages this information to allow us to work differently through a more technology-enabled, data-driven approach. See \u201cFedEx Express Segment \u2014 FedEx Express \u2014 Operations\u201d and \u201cFedEx Ground Segment \u2014 Operations\u201d above for information regarding how FedEx Dataworks is enabling the transformation and optimization of our physical network at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. FedEx Dataworks is also helping to build out a dynamic pricing infrastructure, which enabled 2023 holiday peak residential surcharges to adjust dynamically based on an individual customer\u2019s weekly peaking factor, and exploring and implementing ways for predictive anomaly detection to improve revenue quality.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Surround allows business customers to enhance visibility into its supply chain by leveraging data to provide near-real-time analytics into shipment tracking, which will drive more precise logistics and inventory management. FedEx Dataworks is helping to facilitate an open and collaborative e-commerce ecosystem that helps merchants provide seamless end-to-end experiences for their customers. ShopRunner is an e-commerce platform that directly connects brands and merchants with online shoppers. ShopRunner\u2019s data-driven marketing and omnichannel enablement capabilities also help brands and merchants acquire high-value customers and accelerate their digital innovation by using ShopRunner\u2019s e-commerce platform. We believe the complementary nature of ShopRunner\u2019s pre-purchase offerings combined with FedEx\u2019s post-purchase logistics intelligence enables brands and merchants to attract and engage consumers at scale by providing innovative online shopping experiences. In November 2022, ShopRunner announced the launch of its new mobile application.

Many of these locations are open later in the evenings to accommodate urgent printing projects and delivery drop-offs. FedEx Office has designed a suite of printing and shipping management solutions that are flexible and scalable, allowing customers to meet their unique printing and shipping needs. The network provides an adaptable cost model helping to save time, labor, and overhead by freeing up resources and avoiding fixed costs associated with large-scale printing and e-commerce parcel volumes.

Additionally, FedEx Office has partnered with a leading marketing solutions company to introduce an online branded promotional products marketplace that allows businesses to customize and purchase high-quality promotional products. FedEx Office has also made investments in new machines and technology, enhancing capabilities in narrow format color, grand format, large format, color management, enhanced finishing, and other technologies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Office provides customers convenient access to the full range of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipping services. Customers may have their FedEx Express and FedEx Ground packages delivered to any FedEx Office customer-facing location nationwide through the Hold at FedEx Location service, free of charge, and may redirect packages to these locations through Redirect to Hold or AutoRedirect to Hold services.

FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Services, FedEx Office, FedEx Logistics, FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Trade Networks Transport & Brokerage, FedEx Supply Chain, FedEx Custom Critical, and ShopRunner, among others, are trademarks, service marks, and trade names of Federal Express Corporation or the respective companies for which registrations, or applications for registration, are on file, as applicable. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks, and trade names by our contractors and Global Service Participants to support our business. In addition, we license the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks, and trade names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness.\n \n\n\nRegulation\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAir\n. Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the \u201cFederal Aviation Act\u201d), both the U.S. Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) and the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d) exercise regulatory authority over FedEx Express.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- \n20\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe FAA\u2019s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and maintenance, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe DOT\u2019s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOT\u2019s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT, authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis. These certificates will remain in effect as we maintain our economic fitness to perform all-cargo services in connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (\u201cTSA\u201d), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires FedEx Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (\u201cCRAF\u201d) program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use certain of FedEx Express\u2019s wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. government for such charter flights.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSee \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report for discussion of regulations related to pilots, including the proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations, that could affect our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGround\n. The ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes, or services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx Express is registered in those states that require registration.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Custom Critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates, routes, and services in interstate freight transportation.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLike other interstate motor carriers, our operations, including those at FedEx Express, are subject to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInternational\n. FedEx Express\u2019s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. The right of a U.S. carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the DOT\u2019s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and the foreign government. In addition, the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner, and efficient operations often utilize open skies provisions of aviation agreements. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, such as FedEx Express, are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by U.S. and foreign governments.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur operations outside of the U.S., such as FedEx Express\u2019s international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult, and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as FedEx Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- \n21\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCommunication\n. Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to the Federal Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) regulates and licenses FedEx Express\u2019s activities pertaining to satellite communications, and also manages the spectrum allocation and licensing process. The FCC recently expanded the use of the 3.7 to 4.2 gigahertz (\u201cGHz\u201d) spectrum band, which has historically been reserved for aviation, to support the implementation of \u201c5G\u201d cellular networks across the U.S. In December 2021, following concerns of potential interference with aircraft radio altimeters by the expanded use of the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz spectrum band, the FAA issued airworthiness directives prohibiting U.S. aircraft operators from operating at U.S. airports affected by 5G cellular networks without radio altimeter retrofits or other enhancements unless authorized via an alternative means of compliance. FedEx Express\u2019s U.S. air operations continued to operate with minimal interruption due to the FAA\u2019s issuance of alternative means of compliance while the company modified its fleet to comply with the directives. In June 2022, the FAA announced its expectation that U.S. aircraft operators have radio altimeter retrofits or other enhancements in place by July 2023. As of July 1, 2023, FedEx Express\u2019s U.S. air operations are in compliance with the airworthiness directives, and we do not expect any subsequent operational disruptions from \u201c5G\u201d cellular network implementation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEnvironmental\n.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNoise\n:\n \nPursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d), is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. FedEx Express\u2019s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. In addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a restrictive effect on FedEx Express\u2019s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect in any of FedEx Express\u2019s significant markets. Congress\u2019s passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Express\u2019s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions\n:\n \nConcern over climate change, including the effect of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions. Increasingly, state and local governments are also considering GHG regulatory requirements. Compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change. In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (\u201cICAO\u201d) formally adopted a global, market-based emissions offset program known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\u201cCORSIA\u201d). This program established a goal for the aviation industry to achieve carbon neutral growth in international aviation beginning in calendar 2021. Any growth above a global industry emissions baseline would need to be addressed using either eligible carbon offset credits or qualifying sustainable aviation fuel purchases. The baseline was originally set as an average of calendar 2019 and calendar 2020 emissions. In 2023, due to the effects of COVID-19 on the airline industry, the ICAO adopted a new baseline of 85% of calendar 2019 emissions. To date, however, while the U.S. Congress is considering proposals to afford the DOT and FAA full authority to implement the market-based measures of CORSIA, the U.S. has not fully implemented CORSIA. In the interim, we continue to voluntarily report our emissions data to the FAA.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOther ICAO member states are moving forward with implementing CORSIA, and have taken additional action to reduce aircraft GHG emissions. For example, both the EU and the United Kingdom have implemented regulations to include aviation in the Emissions Trading Scheme (\u201cETS\u201d). For the EU, under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) is subject to the ETS. Beginning in calendar 2012, airlines including FedEx were required to purchase emissions allowances or, alternatively, purchase qualifying sustainable aviation fuel if they exceeded the number of free allowances allocated under the ETS. While the current scope of ETS has been limited to apply only to flights within the EEA through calendar 2026, the EU adopted legislation in 2023 requiring that a study be conducted in July 2026 reassessing whether the European Commission should propose to expand the scope of ETS to include international flights from the EEA based on CORSIA implementation and performance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe expect compliance with CORSIA and the ETS to increase FedEx operating expenses. The amount of such increase will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including the number of our flights subject to CORSIA and the ETS, the fuel efficiency of our fleet, the average growth of the aviation sector, our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuels in the future and the price of such fuels, and the price of eligible emission units, offsets, or allowances required to be purchased by FedEx.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- \n22\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, in 2017, ICAO adopted new carbon dioxide emissions standards that would apply not only to new aircraft types as of calendar 2020, but also to new deliveries of currently in-production aircraft types from calendar 2023. ICAO established a production cutoff date of January 1, 2028 for aircraft that do not comply with these standards. The standards are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over 60 tons. In 2021, the EPA adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine GHG emissions standards, which are aligned with the 2017 ICAO emissions standards, and the FAA is advancing its own conforming rulemaking to implement the standards through its aircraft certification process. In the past, the U.S. Congress has also considered bills that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. In 2021 the U.S. reentered the Paris climate accord, an agreement among 197 countries to reduce GHG emissions. The effect of the reentry on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions and on other GHG regulation is uncertain. Additionally, the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHazardous Substances\n: In calendar 2022, the EPA proposed regulations to categorize certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\u201cPFAS\u201d) as \u201chazardous substances\u201d under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d). Numerous U.S. states, including California, have adopted additional regulations governing these substances. PFAS are used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products, including the firefighting foams approved for use by the FAA to extinguish fuel-based fires at airports and refineries. The EPA\u2019s proposed rule, once finalized, could subject airports, airlines, and refineries to potential liability for cleanup of historical PFAS contamination. We could incur remediation costs for currently and formerly operated facilities. While the impact of this rulemaking on our business and results of operations cannot currently be predicted, we remain committed to transitioning to PFAS-free materials for fire suppression in accordance with the framework outlined by the FAA in May 2023.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are also subject to international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the shipment of dangerous goods and contingency planning for spills of petroleum products. Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise, and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. FedEx Express has an environmental management system based on International Standardization 14001 designed to maintain compliance with these regulations and minimize our operational environmental footprint, and certified all U.S. airport locations in 2022.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nExport Controls\n. \nIn recent years, the U.S. government has increased the number of companies and persons subject to U.S. export control regulations. Such regulations can restrict the types of items that FedEx customers are permitted to ship to certain entities, and in some instances may prohibit FedEx from serving certain entities altogether. Violations of these regulations can result in significant monetary and other penalties. For example, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (the \u201cECRA\u201d) and its implementing regulations, the Export Administration Regulations (the \u201cEARs\u201d), hold carriers such as FedEx strictly liable for shipments that may violate the EARs without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations. Violations of the ECRA can result in criminal penalties of up to $1 million and civil penalties of $305,000 (or twice the value of the transaction) per individual violation. FedEx is investing in improvements and updates to its export control compliance programs. However, the heightened focus on export controls by the U.S. government increases FedEx\u2019s exposure to potential regulatory penalties and could result in higher compliance costs.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCustoms\n. \nOur activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding), and the DOT (air freight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLabor\n. \nAll U.S. employees at FedEx Express are covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the \u201cRLA\u201d), while labor relations within the U.S. at our other companies are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the \u201cNLRA\u201d). Under the RLA, groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees. The RLA also requires mandatory government-led mediation of contract disputes supervised by the NMB before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms. This part of the RLA helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy. Under the NLRA, employees can unionize in small localized groups, and government-led mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe RLA was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations. As transportation systems evolved, the law expanded to cover airlines, which are now the dominant national transportation systems. As an air express carrier with an integrated air/ground network, FedEx Express and its employees have been covered by the RLA since the founding of the company. The purpose of the RLA is to offer employees a process by which to unionize (if they choose) and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays. Specifically, the RLA ensures that an entire transportation system, such as at FedEx Express, cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- \n23\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For example, there is always a possibility that Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA, thereby exposing the FedEx Express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire air/ground network. This jurisdiction could be challenged in connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan. In addition, federal and state governmental agencies, such as the NMB and the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d), have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees, and employees of service providers contracting with FedEx Ground, to organize under the RLA or NLRA. For a description of these and other potential labor law changes, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nData Protection\n. There has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection, use, retention, transfer, and processing of personal data in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and internationally. For more information regarding data protection regulation, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.\n \n\n\n- \n24\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n",
    "item1a": ">ITEM 1A. RIS\nK FACTORS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the price of our common stock. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the price of our common stock.\n\n\nMacroeconomic and Market Risks\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are directly affected by the state of the global economy and geopolitical developments.\n While macroeconomic risks apply to most companies, we are particularly vulnerable. The transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trends in economic activity. Our primary business is to transport goods, so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production of goods and the rate of growth of global trade \u2014 key macroeconomic measurements influenced by, among other things, inflation and deflation, supply chain disruptions, interest rates and currency exchange rates, labor costs and unemployment levels, fuel and energy prices, public health crises, inventory levels, buying patterns and disposable income, debt levels, and credit availability. When individuals and companies purchase and produce fewer goods, we transport fewer goods, and as companies move manufacturing closer to consumer markets and expand the number of distribution centers, we transport goods shorter distances, which adversely affects our yields and profitability. Certain manufacturers and retailers are making investments to produce and house goods in closer proximity to supply chains and consumers in connection with recent macroeconomic, geopolitical, and public health developments. Additionally, consumer spending has shifted from goods to services, and in 2023 we saw a customer preference for slower, less costly shipping services. We expect these trends to continue. Further, the scale of our operations and our relatively high fixed-cost structure, particularly at FedEx Express, make it difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels, which negatively affected our results of operations in 2023. For more information, see \u201cOur businesses are capital intensive, and we must make capital decisions based upon projected volume levels.\u201d below.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur results in 2023 were adversely impacted by lower global volumes due to weak economic conditions. We are experiencing a decline in demand for our transportation services as inflation and interest rate increases are negatively affecting consumer and business spending. Additionally, we are experiencing higher costs to serve through higher fuel prices, wage rates, purchased transportation costs, and other direct operating expenses such as operational supplies. During 2024, we expect macroeconomic conditions to continue to negatively affect customer demand for our services. See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report for additional information.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMoreover, given the nature of our business and our global operations, political, economic, and other conditions in foreign countries and regions, including international taxes, government-to-government relations, the typically more volatile economies of emerging markets, and geopolitical risks such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. We have suspended all services in Ukraine and Belarus. We also temporarily idled our operations in Russia and reduced our presence to the minimum required for purposes of maintaining a legal presence with active transport licenses. While we do not expect this conflict to have a direct material effect on our business or results of operations, the broader consequences of this conflict, which may include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts; airspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic decisions to alter certain routes; potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against us as a result of our idling of operations in Russia, including nationalization of foreign businesses in Russia; increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate; and the extent of the conflict\u2019s effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo the extent the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, or subsequent similar conflicts between or among other nations, adversely affects our business, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in this Annual Report, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattack or cyber-intrusion, ransomware attack, or malware attack; adverse changes in international trade policies; our ability to maintain or increase our prices, including our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs; our ability to implement and execute our business strategy, particularly with regard to our FedEx Express international business; disruptions in global supply chains, which can limit the access of FedEx and our service providers to vehicles and other key capital resources and increase our costs and could affect our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040; our ability to maintain our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand; terrorist activities targeting transportation infrastructure; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets. Geopolitical uncertainty negatively affected operations at FedEx Express in recent years.\n \n\n\n- \n25\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditional changes in international trade policies and relations could significantly reduce the volume of goods transported globally and adversely affect our business and results of operations. \nThe U.S. government has taken certain actions that have negatively affected U.S. trade, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the U.S. Additionally, several foreign governments have imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from the U.S. These actions contributed to weakness in the global economy that adversely affected our results of operations in recent years. Any further changes in U.S. or international trade policy, including tariffs, export controls, quotas, embargoes, or sanctions, could trigger additional retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \u201ctrade wars\u201d and further increased costs for goods transported globally, which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay tariffs or other anti-trade measures increase their prices, or in trading partners limiting their trade with countries that impose such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade and other disputes could also have a negative effect on business and consumer confidence and spending. Such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as on the price of our common\n \nstock.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. government has taken action to limit the ability of domestic companies to engage in commerce with certain foreign entities under certain circumstances, and foreign governments may investigate our compliance with these restrictions. Furthermore, given the nature of our business and our global recognizability, foreign governments may target FedEx by limiting the ability of foreign entities to do business with us in certain instances, imposing monetary or other penalties or taking other retaliatory action, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as on the price of our common stock.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur transportation businesses are affected by the price and availability of jet and vehicle fuel.\n We must purchase large quantities of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles, and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly volatile. In addition, our purchased transportation expense is affected by fuel costs. To date, we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense effect of higher fuel costs through our indexed fuel surcharges, as the amount of the surcharges is closely linked to the market prices for fuel. If we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges because of competitive pricing pressures or some other reason, fuel costs could adversely affect our operating results. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report for more information. As of May 31, 2023, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges, high fuel surcharges could move our customers away from our higher-yielding express services to our lower-yielding deferred or ground services or even reduce customer demand for our services altogether. In addition, disruptions in the supply of fuel could have a negative effect on our ability to operate our transportation networks. The following factors may affect fuel supply and could result in shortages and price increases in the future: weather-related events; natural disasters; political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries; economic sanctions imposed against oil-producing countries or specific industry participants; changes in governmental policy concerning fuel production, transportation, taxes, or marketing; changes in refining capacity; environmental concerns; cyberattacks; and public and investor sentiment. Several of these factors combined to constrain fuel supply in 2023, and we expect such conditions to continue to be present in 2024.\n\n\nOperating Risks\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe failure to successfully execute our DRIVE transformation program, including Network 2.0, and our one FedEx consolidation plan in the expected time frame and at the expected cost may adversely affect our future results. \nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, FedEx announced our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability, including Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada. In the fourth quarter of 2023, FedEx announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and other FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation. See \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d and \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report for more information. These entities currently operate as separate and independent businesses and networks. There can be no assurances that these businesses and networks can successfully be consolidated and fully integrated as planned. It is possible that the consolidation and integration process could result in higher than currently expected costs, less-than-expected savings, the loss of customers, the disruption of ongoing businesses, union organizing, litigation, the loss of key FedEx employees or service providers, or other unexpected issues. It is also possible that the overall process will take longer than currently anticipated. Additionally, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in order to realize the anticipated timing and projected benefits of our DRIVE transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     combining the physical networks and operations of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, including consolidating the companies\u2019 linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, and corporate functions;\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     our ability to maintain coverage of U.S. employees at FedEx Express under the RLA and manage challenges to the employment status of drivers employed by service providers engaged by FedEx Ground, in addition to other labor-related risks;\n\n\n- \n26\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     integrating, consolidating, and implementing new administrative and back-office support functions, information-technology infrastructure, and computer systems of the respective companies;\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     integrating and restructuring the corporate entities;\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     integrating and unifying the offerings and services available to historical FedEx Express and FedEx Ground customers;\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     harmonizing the companies\u2019 operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls, and other policies, procedures, and processes;\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     maintaining existing agreements with customers and service providers and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers and service providers;\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     legal challenges by FedEx Ground service providers or government agencies seeking to slow or stop plans related to Network 2.0 or our one FedEx consolidation;\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures, and management philosophies;\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     addressing employee issues so as to promote retention and maintain efficient and effective labor and employee relations;\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     maintaining access to ports of call and railroads for intermodal support;\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     managing the movement of certain positions to different locations;\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     obtaining any required regulatory licenses, operating authority, or contractual consents; and\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     managing unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the consolidation and integration process.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe may not be able to achieve the expected operational efficiencies and network flexibility, alignment of our cost base with demand, cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost structure, and other benefits from our DRIVE transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan. The actual amount and timing of costs to be incurred and related cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost structure resulting from these initiatives and enhancements may differ from our current expectations and estimates. These initiatives and enhancements could also result in asset impairment charges and changes to our tax liabilities and deferred tax balances. If we are not able to successfully implement our DRIVE transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan, our future financial results will suffer and we may not be able to achieve our financial performance goals.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAll of these factors could adversely affect FedEx\u2019s results of operations and negatively affect the price of our common stock. In addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management may be focused on the DRIVE transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt our business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operations and result in the loss of critical confidential information, adversely affecting our reputation, business, or results of operations. \nOur ability to attract and retain customers, efficiently operate our businesses, execute our DRIVE transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan, and compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication, security, and reliability of our technology network, including our ability to provide features of service that are important to our customers, to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers, and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations. For example, we rely on information technology to receive package-level information in advance of physical receipt of packages, to track items that move through our delivery systems, to efficiently plan deliveries, to clear shipments through customs, to execute billing processes, and to track and report financial and operational data. We are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and operational disruptions, including through cyberattack or cyber-intrusion, ransomware attack, or malware attack by computer hackers, foreign governments and state-sponsored actors, cyber terrorists and activists, cyber criminals, malicious employees or other insiders of FedEx or third-party service providers, and other groups and individuals. Data breaches and other technology disruptions of companies and governments continue to increase as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased and we, our customers, and third parties increasingly store and transmit data by means of connected information technology systems. Additionally, risks such as code anomalies, \u201cActs of God,\u201d transitional challenges in migrating operating company functionality to our FedEx enterprise automation platforms, data leakage, cyber-fraud, and human error pose a direct threat to our products, services, systems, and data and could result in unauthorized or block legitimate access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations, customers, employees, and suppliers, including personal information.\n \n\n\n- \n27\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe technology infrastructure of acquired businesses, as well as their practices related to the use and maintenance of data, could also present issues that we were not able to identify prior to the acquisition. For example, ShopRunner, which we acquired in 2021, collects and stores certain personal data of its merchants and their buyers, its partners, consumers with whom it has a direct relationship, and users of its applications. Additionally, it uses third-party service providers and subprocessors to help deliver services to merchants and their buyers. These service providers and subprocessors may store or access personal data, including payment information and/or other confidential information. The foregoing factors increase the risk of data incidents and the amount of potential exposure in the event of a data breach.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe also depend on and interact with the technology and systems of third parties, including our customers and third-party service providers such as cloud service providers and delivery services. Such third parties may host, process, or have access to information we maintain about our company, customers, employees, and vendors or operate systems that are critical to our business operations and services. Like us, these third parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches, cyberattacks, and other events or actions that could damage, disrupt, or close down their networks or systems. We have security processes, protocols, and standards in place, including contractual provisions requiring such security measures, that are applicable to such third parties and are designed to protect information that is held by them, or to which they have access, as a result of their engagements with us. Nevertheless, a cyberattack could defeat one or more of such third parties\u2019 security measures, allowing an attacker to obtain information about our company, customers, employees, and vendors or disrupt our operations. These third parties may also experience operational disruptions or human error that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations, customers, employees, and suppliers, including personal information.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA disruption to our complex, global technology infrastructure, including those affecting our computer systems and websites, could result in the loss of confidential business or customer information, require substantial repairs or replacements, resulting in significant costs, and lead to the temporary or permanent transfer by customers of some or all of their business to our competitors. The foregoing could harm our reputation and adversely affect our operations, customer service, and results of operations. Additionally, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created. These types of adverse effects could also occur in the event the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of company and customer information was compromised due to a data loss by FedEx or a trusted third party. We or the third parties with which we share information may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information-technology risk management, business continuity, and disaster recovery plans, including investments to retire and replace end-of-life systems. The development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly more frequent, intense, and sophisticated. Despite our efforts, we are not fully insulated from data breaches, technology disruptions, data loss, and cyber-fraud, which could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2021 for information regarding the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack at TNT Express and immaterial cyber incidents we experienced in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, we have experienced continual attempts by cyber criminals, some of which have been successful, to gain access to customer accounts for the purposes of fraudulently diverting and misappropriating items being transported in our network. None of these fraudulent cyber activities caused a material disruption to our systems or resulted in any material costs to FedEx.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile we have significant security processes and initiatives in place, we may be unable to detect or prevent a breach or disruption in the future. Additionally, while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place, we cannot be certain that we will continue to be able to obtain excess insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, our insurance carriers will pay on our insurance claims, or we will not experience a claim for which coverage is not provided. See \u201cOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection.\u201d below for additional information on risks related to legal and regulatory developments with respect to data protection. A significant number of our employees as well as customers and others with whom we do business continue to work remotely or in hybrid models, which may heighten these risks. These risks may also be heightened by our DRIVE transformation, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan.\n\n\n- \n28\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are self-insured for certain costs associated with our operations, and insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on us. \nWe are self-insured up to certain limits that vary by operating company and type of risk for costs associated with workers\u2019 compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. Our self-insurance accruals are primarily based on estimated costs determined by actuarial methods. Estimated costs include consideration of a variety of factors and related assumptions such as the severity of claims, frequency and volume of claims, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs, which may be subject to a high degree of variability. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known, which may be several years. Material increases in the magnitude of claims, changes to healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, insurance retention levels, judgment and settlement amounts, associated legal expenses, and other factors could result in unfavorable differences between actual self-insurance costs and our reserve estimates. As a result, our insurance and claims costs could continue to increase materially which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. During 2023, higher self-insurance accruals negatively affected our results of operations. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report for more information.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs a supplement to our self-insurance program, we maintain coverage with excess insurance carriers for potential losses that exceed the amounts we self-insure. Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance, risk volatility, and premium expense. Although we believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover our historic claims amounts, the commercial trucking industry has experienced a wave of blockbuster or so-called \u201cnuclear\u201d verdicts, including some instances in which juries have awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to those injured in accidents and their families. See Note 9 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in \u201cItem 1. Financial Statements\u201d of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended August 31, 2022 for information regarding the 2015 jury award of approximately $160 million in compensatory damages in a lawsuit related to a vehicle accident involving a driver employed by a service provider engaged by FedEx Ground, subsequent court affirmation of the award in 2018 and 2022, and our pursuit of reimbursement from insurers of our payment of approximately $210 million of pre- and post-judgment interest. Given this recent trend, it is possible that additional claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. If another claim were to exceed our aggregate insurance coverage, we would bear the excess in addition to our other self-insured amounts.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGiven the current claims environment, the amount of coverage available from excess insurance carriers is decreasing, the premiums for this excess coverage are increasing significantly, and excess insurance carriers are challenging insurance claims more frequently. Accordingly, our excess insurance and claims expenses may continue to increase, or we could further increase our self-insured retention as policies are renewed or replaced. Our results of operations and financial condition could continue to be adversely affected if our costs or losses significantly exceed our aggregate coverage limits, we are unable to obtain excess insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, our insurance carriers fail to pay on our insurance claims, or we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe effects of a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or public health crisis on our business, results of operations, and financial condition are highly unpredictable. \nA widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or public health crisis, including new variants of COVID-19, could have varying effects on the demand for our services, our business operations, and the global economy and supply chains. The extent of the effect of such an event on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as the global economy, will be dictated by developments that cannot be predicted, such as its duration and spread; the success of efforts to contain it and treat its effects, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business and government shutdowns, and other restrictions; the possibility of additional subsequent widespread outbreaks and variant strains and the effect of actions taken in response; and the resulting effects on the economic conditions in the global markets in which we operate. We have now shifted to operating in a more stable post-COVID-19 environment with less restrictions, which resulted in consumers returning to near pre-pandemic shopping patterns during 2023.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business is labor and capital intensive in nature, which may require us to incur higher costs to operate our networks during such an event. If we are unable to remain agile and flex our networks to align with shipping volumes, customer needs, disrupted global supply chains and other network inefficiencies, market demands, and operating conditions, or are unable to continuously respond to evolving governmental policies, our business operations could be negatively affected, which could have a further adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, due to the size, scope, and geographically dispersed nature of our operations, the expenses we incur to protect the health and safety of our team members and customers may be higher than similar expenses incurred by companies in other industries.\n\n\n- \n29\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo the extent a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or public health crisis adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks described in this section, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such risks include, but are not limited to, additional changes in the state of the global economy and international trade policies and relations; our ability to execute our DRIVE transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan, implement our business strategy, and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences; our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand; our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation needs while controlling related costs; changes in the business and financial soundness of the USPS; our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040; and the effect of litigation or claims from customers, team members, suppliers, regulators, or other third parties relating to the crisis or our actions in response.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSee \u201cDescription of Business Segments  \u2014 Trends Affecting Our Business\u201d under \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report, as well as \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended May 31, 2020, May 31, 2021, and May 31, 2022, for information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe transportation infrastructure continues to be a target of terrorist activities.\n Because transportation assets continue to be a target of terrorist activities, governments around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirements that will increase operating costs and potentially slow service for businesses, including those in the transportation industry. These security requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. For example, the TSA requires FedEx Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. Additionally, the ICAO\u2019s standard that previously allowed a member state to permit carriers and other entities to determine, without government oversight, which shippers and shipments are secure for purposes of putting those shipments on all-cargo aircraft was modified effective July 1, 2021. As a result, we are now required to undertake additional security measures for international outbound shipments. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us or slow our service to our customers. The effects on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of aircraft by parties to those conflicts can also be significant. Moreover, a terrorist attack directed at FedEx or other aspects of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operations and adversely affect demand for our services.\n \n\n\nStrategic Risks\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFailure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences will cause our future financial results to suffer. \nWe are making significant investments and other decisions in connection with our long-term business strategy, such as those related to our DRIVE transformation, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan. See \u201cThe failure to successfully execute our DRIVE transformation, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan in the expected time frame and at the expected cost may adversely affect our future results.\u201d above and\n \n\u201cItem 1. Business\u201d and \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report for additional information. Such initiatives and enhancements may require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur significant expenses. We have also incurred, and may continue to incur, increased operating expenses in connection with certain changes to our business strategy. We may not be able to derive the expected operational efficiencies and network flexibility, alignment of our cost base with demand, cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost structure, and other benefits from our strategic investments and other decisions.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurther, in developing our business strategy, we make certain assumptions including, but not limited to, those related to customer demand and the mix of services to be purchased by our customers, the future rate of e-commerce growth and inventory restocking, passenger airline cargo capacity, competition, and the global economy, and actual market, economic, and other conditions may be different from our assumptions. As technology, customer behavior, and market conditions continue to evolve, it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and service offerings to our customers. If we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences, our future financial results will suffer. For additional discussion, see \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d of this Annual Report under the caption \u201cStrategy.\u201d\n\n\n- \n30\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur businesses are capital intensive, and we must make capital decisions based upon projected volume levels.\n We make significant investments in aircraft, package handling facilities, vehicles, technology, sort equipment, acquired companies, and other assets to support our transportation and business networks. The amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors, including our anticipated volume growth. We must make commitments to purchase or modify aircraft years before the aircraft are actually needed. We must predict volume levels and fleet requirements and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. Missing our projections could result in too much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volumes. Overcapacity could lead to below-market asset dispositions or write-downs, as well as negatively affect operating margins, and undercapacity could negatively affect service levels. Difficulties in quickly adjusting our operations and fixed-cost structure to match shifting volume levels, particularly at FedEx Express, negatively affected our results of operations in 2023. Additionally, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition \u2014 Results of Operations and Outlook \u2014 Consolidated Results \u2014 Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges\u201d of this Annual Report for information regarding a noncash impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with our decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines from service.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe depend on our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand.\n The FedEx brand name symbolizes high-quality service, reliability, and speed. FedEx is one of the most widely recognized, trusted, and respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand is one of our most important and valuable assets. In addition, we have a strong reputation among customers, team members, and the general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethics. The FedEx brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales, marketing, and recruitment tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our team members or others with whom we do business, such as customer service mishaps, accidents, catastrophes, or incidents involving aircraft, vehicles, or facilities operated by us or our service providers; low safety or service levels; data breaches or technology infrastructure disruptions; noncompliance with laws and allegations or claims that result in litigation; the shipment of certain items pursuant to our obligation as a common carrier operating under federal law; labor relations and workforce reductions; our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, or marketing programs; our political activities and expenditures; our executive compensation practices; or use of artificial intelligence could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. With the increase in the use of social media outlets such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly without context, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Certain forms of technology also allow users to alter images, videos, and other information relating to FedEx and present the information in a false or misleading manner. Further, our actual or perceived position or lack of position on environmental, social, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation with certain groups, including our customers, team members, governments, and regulatory bodies. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and/or create difficulties in retaining and recruiting employee talent, and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChanges in the business or financial soundness of the USPS, including strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air network of FedEx Express, are likely to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n The USPS is the largest customer of FedEx Express, which provides domestic air transportation services for the USPS\u2019s First Class Mail, Priority Mail Express, and Priority Mail and transportation and delivery for the USPS\u2019s international delivery service. See \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d of this Annual Report under \u201cFedEx Express Segment\u201d for more information.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPursuant to previously announced plans to restructure its operations, the USPS continues to implement strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air network of FedEx Express, which negatively affected our results of operations in 2023. FedEx Express expects lower volumes from the USPS in 2024. Additional changes in the USPS\u2019s business, including further structural changes to its operations, network, volume levels, service offerings, service commitments, or pricing, could have additional negative effects on our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, the USPS\u2019s contract with FedEx Express for domestic services expires on September 29, 2024, and there is no assurance that the contract will be renewed on terms that are commercially acceptable to FedEx. Additionally, a decision by the USPS to terminate the contract early could negatively affect our profitability.\n\n\n- \n31\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe face intense competition.\n The transportation and business services markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. Some of our competitors have more financial resources and competitive advantages than we do, appear willing to operate at little or no margin to gain market share, or they are owned, controlled, or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to raise capital more easily. We also compete with regional transportation providers that operate smaller and less capital-intensive transportation networks and startup companies that combine technology with flexible labor solutions such as crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, which could in turn reduce our revenues and market share. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. See \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d of this Annual Report for additional information.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe we compete effectively with these companies \u2013 for example, by providing more reliable service at compensatory prices. However, the existence of an irrational pricing environment could limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our prices (including our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs), but also to maintain or grow our revenues and market share. While we believe we compete effectively through our current and planned service offerings, if our current competitors or potential future competitors offer a broader range of services or better service levels, more effectively bundle their services, or offer services at lower prices, it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share. Continued transportation industry consolidation may further increase competition. Moreover, if high-volume package shippers further develop or expand internal capabilities for the services we provide, it may reduce our revenue and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. These effects could be exacerbated if high-volume package shippers offer such capabilities to third parties. News regarding such developments or expansions could also negatively affect the price of our common stock.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, advancements in technology, such as advanced safety systems; automated package sorting, handling, and delivery; autonomous delivery; third-party supply chain insight and management; artificial intelligence; vehicle platooning; alternative fuel vehicles; and digitization of freight services, may necessitate that we increase investments in order to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher rates to cover the cost of these investments.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur inability to execute and effectively operate, integrate, leverage, and grow acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances and investments could materially adversely affect us.\n Our strategy for long-term growth, productivity, and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and investments, form joint ventures or strategic alliances, and realize the expected benefits from these transactions. We regularly acquire businesses, enter into strategic alliances, and make investments across the more than 220 countries and territories in which we provide services.\n\n\n \n\n\nAcquisitions and other strategic transactions involve special commercial, customer, accounting, regulatory, compliance, information technology, human resources, cultural, and other risks, including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies. Additionally, we may be required to make significant capital expenditures and/or incur certain operating expenses following the completion of certain transactions, which may be higher than initially expected. For example, existing and future customer data in the systems and business of FedEx and ShopRunner may not be ultimately interoperable, or may not be interoperable without significant added expense.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile we expect our past and future acquisitions and strategic transactions to enhance our value proposition to customers and improve our business and long-term profitability, there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectations within the time frame we have established, if at all, or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to acquired businesses, including their goodwill or other intangible assets. We have previously incurred goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions, some of which have been material, and may incur additional goodwill impairment charges in the future. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition \u2014 Results of Operations and Outlook \u2014 Consolidated Results \u2014 Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges\u201d of this Annual Report for information regarding a noncash impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the ShopRunner acquisition.\n\n\n- \n32\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHuman Resource Management Risks\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur failure to attract and retain employee talent, meet our purchased transportation needs, or maintain our company culture, as well as increases in labor and purchased transportation costs, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. \nOur success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our high-quality employees, many of whom are longstanding FedEx team members. Difficulties in motivating, rewarding, recruiting, and retaining employee talent, including successors to members of senior management; the unexpected loss of such individuals resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base; and/or our inability to successfully transition key roles could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation, and the price of our common stock. We also regularly seek to hire a large number of part-time and seasonal workers, and FedEx Ground utilizes contracted service providers to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCertain positions at FedEx have historically experienced high turnover rates, which can lead to increased recruiting, training, and retention costs. Additionally, our company culture is important to providing high-quality customer service and having a productive workforce and could be adversely affected by our growing operations and other factors. If we fail to maintain the strength of our company culture, our competitive ability and our business may be harmed.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business is labor intensive in nature, and our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation needs while controlling related costs is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of qualified service providers and persons in the markets where we and our contracted service providers operate and unemployment levels within these markets, prevailing and competitive wage rates and other benefits, health and other insurance costs, inflation, fuel and energy prices and availability, behavioral changes, adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations (including increased minimum wage requirements) or government programs, safety levels of our operations, our reputation within the labor and transportation markets, changes in the business or financial soundness of service providers, interest in contracting with FedEx, the effect of a widespread public health crisis, the availability of child care, and vaccine mandates that may be announced in jurisdictions in which our businesses and service providers operate. Additionally, certain service providers (acting collectively or in coordination in some instances) may seek to increase financial rates or modify contract terms and may refuse to provide service to FedEx in connection with such initiatives.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur inability to effectively meet our labor and purchased transportation needs can increase our costs, hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, negatively affect service levels, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Certain of these risks may be heightened by our DRIVE transformation, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLabor organizations attempt to organize groups of our employees from time to time, and potential changes in labor laws could make it easier for them to do so.\n If we are unable to maintain positive relationships with our employees and to avoid having labor organizations organize groups of our employees, our operating costs could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced. Despite continual organizing attempts by labor unions, other than the pilots at FedEx Express and drivers at one FedEx Freight facility, our U.S. employees have thus far chosen not to unionize (we acquired FedEx Supply Chain in 2015, which already had a small number of employees who are members of unions). Additionally, certain of FedEx Express\u2019s non-U.S. employees are unionized. For information regarding the tentative successor agreement FedEx Express reached with the union representing the pilots of FedEx Express in May 2023, see \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d of this Annual Report under the caption \u201cFedEx Express Segment \u2014 FedEx Express \u2014 Employees.\u201d\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLabor unions have recently attempted to organize employees at businesses and in industries that have not traditionally been unionized, and in certain instances have been successful. Such attempts could continue in 2024. Additionally, the U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For example, there is always a possibility that Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA. Additionally, this jurisdiction could be challenged in connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan. For additional discussion of the RLA, see \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d of this Annual Report under the caption \u201cRegulation.\u201d Such legislation or challenge could expose our customers to the type of service disruptions that the RLA was designed to prevent \u2014 local work stoppages in key areas that interrupt the timely flow of shipments of time-sensitive, high-value goods throughout our global network. Such disruptions could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping options and ready access to global markets.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- \n33\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is also the possibility that Congress could pass other labor legislation that could adversely affect our companies, such as FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, whose employees are governed by the NLRA. In addition, federal and state governmental agencies, such as the NMB and the NLRB, have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees, as well as our vendor and supplier workforces, to organize under the RLA or NLRA. Finally, changes to federal or state laws, regulations, rules, judicial or administrative precedent, or guidance governing employee classification could affect the status of FedEx Ground\u2019s service providers as independent employers of drivers. If FedEx Ground is deemed to be an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these service providers, labor organizations could more easily organize these individuals, our operating costs could increase materially, and we could incur significant capital outlays and experience adverse effects to service levels.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Ground contracts with service providers to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, and the status of these service providers as direct and exclusive employers of drivers providing these services is being challenged.\n We are defending joint-employer cases where it is alleged that FedEx Ground should be treated as an employer or joint employer of the drivers employed by service providers engaged by FedEx Ground. We incur certain costs, including legal fees, in defending the status of service providers engaged by FedEx Ground as direct employers of their drivers. We continue to believe that FedEx Ground is not an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these independent businesses. However, adverse determinations in these matters or regulatory developments could, among other things, entitle service providers\u2019 drivers to certain wage payments and penalties from the service providers and FedEx Ground, and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for FedEx Ground. The status of the drivers employed by these service providers could be further challenged in connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProposed pilot flight and duty time regulations could impair our operations and impose substantial costs on us\n. \nIn 2010, the FAA proposed regulations that would change the flight and duty time rules applicable to all-cargo air carriers. When the FAA issued final regulations in 2011 (the \u201c2011 regulations\u201d), all-cargo carriers, including FedEx Express, were exempt from these new requirements. Instead, all-cargo carriers were required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules and allowed to pursue the development of fatigue risk management systems to develop fatigue mitigations unique to each operation. In 2012, the FAA reaffirmed the exclusion of all-cargo carriers from the 2011 regulations, and litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the FAA\u2019s decision. However, this issue remains a policy priority for certain labor groups, and the U.S. Congress periodically considers legislation that, if adopted, would require all-cargo carriers to comply with the 2011 regulations. Required compliance with the 2011 regulations would make it more difficult to avoid pilot fatigue and could impose substantial costs on us in order to maintain operational reliability.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIncreasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements, and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare benefits, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \nWe sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and postretirement healthcare plans. The costs of providing pension and other retirement benefit plans are dependent on numerous assumptions, such as discount rates, expected long-term investment returns on plan assets, future salary increases, employee turnover, mortality, and retirement ages. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as significant declines in the value of investments that fund our pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and we could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, the rules for pension and retirement benefit plan accounting are complex, involve numerous assumptions, and can produce volatility in our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. For example, our fourth quarter mark-to-market (\u201cMTM\u201d) retirement plans accounting adjustment resulted in a pre-tax, noncash gain of $650 million in 2023 ($493 million, net of tax, or $1.92 per diluted share) and a loss of $1.6 billion in 2022 ($1.2 billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share). For additional information on our MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u2014Results of Operations and Outlook\u2014Consolidated Results\u2014Retirement Plans MTM Adjustments\u201d and Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report.\n\n\n- \n34\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEnvironmental, Climate, and Weather Risks\n\n\nWe may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change. \nConcern over climate change, including the effect of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions. Increasingly, state and local governments are also considering GHG regulatory requirements. Compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change. Increased regulation regarding GHG emissions, especially aircraft or vehicle engine emissions, could impose substantial costs on us, especially at FedEx Express. These costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital and impairment costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. Until the timing, scope, and extent of such possible regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably possible, however, that it could materially increase our operating expenses and have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business, if instituted. For additional discussion of regulatory responses to climate change, including CORSIA and the Paris climate accord, see \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d of this Annual Report under the caption \u201cRegulation.\u201d We may also incur additional expenses as a result of U.S. and international regulators requiring additional disclosures regarding GHG emissions.\n\n\nMoreover, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services, especially our air express services. Finally, given the broad and global scope of our operations and our susceptibility to global macroeconomic trends, we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of climate change that could affect all of humankind, such as shifts in weather patterns and world ecosystems.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be unable to achieve or demonstrate progress on our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040.\n\n\nIn 2021, we announced a goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040. Achievement of this goal depends on our execution of operational strategies relating to vehicle electrification; sustainable fuels; aircraft fuel conservation and fleet modernization; facilities; and sustainable customer solutions.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nExecution of these strategies, as well as demonstrable progress on and achievement of our calendar 2040 goal, is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and achieve the anticipated benefits and associated cost savings of such strategies and actions; the availability and cost of, and our ability to acquire, alternative fuel vehicles, alternative fuels, fuel-efficient aircraft, global electrical charging infrastructure, off-site renewable energy, and other materials and components, many of which are not presently in existence or available at scale; unforeseen production, design, operational, and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments, including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration and/or other related processes; compliance with, and changes or additions to, global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, mandates, or requirements relating to GHG emissions, carbon costs, or climate-related goals; labor-related regulations and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirements on third parties who provide contracted transportation for our transportation networks; the availability of incentives to enhance the production and affordability of alternative fuel vehicles, alternative fuels, global electrical charging infrastructure, and other materials and components; adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions and potentially increased prices for our services; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve or demonstrate progress on our calendar 2040 goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations. Additionally, we may determine that it is in our best interests to prioritize other business, social, governance, or sustainable investments and/or initiatives (including our DRIVE transformation program, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan) over the achievement of our calendar 2040 goal based on economic, regulatory, or social factors, business strategy, or other reasons. Failure to achieve or demonstrate progress on our calendar 2040 goal could damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationships. Further, given investors\u2019 and banks\u2019 increased focus related to ESG matters, such a failure could cause large stockholders to reduce their ownership of FedEx common stock and limit our access to financing. Such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as on the price of our common stock.\n\n\n- \n35\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur inability to quickly and effectively restore operations following adverse weather or a localized disaster or disturbance in a key geography could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n While we operate several integrated networks with assets distributed throughout the world, there are concentrations of key assets within our networks that are exposed to adverse weather conditions or localized risks from natural or manmade disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, severe winter weather, conflicts or unrest, terrorist attacks, or other disturbances, actual or threatened. Additionally, shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change could increase the frequency, severity, or duration of certain adverse weather conditions. Prolonged interruptions or disruptions at a key location such as our FedEx Express Memphis World Hub or one of our information-technology centers could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also may incur significant costs to reestablish or relocate these functions. Moreover, resulting economic dislocations, including supply chain and fuel disruptions, could adversely affect demand for our services resulting in an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n\nOther Legal, Regulatory, and Miscellaneous Risks\n\n\nGovernment regulation and enforcement are evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business. \nWe are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. government regulations, laws, policies, and actions. There can be no assurance that such regulations, laws, policies, and actions will not be changed in ways that will decrease the demand for our services, subject us to escalating costs, or require us to modify our business models and objectives (such as our DRIVE transformation program, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan), harming our financial results. In particular, legislative, regulatory, or other actions that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have undertaken or could take in areas such as data privacy and sovereignty, the use of new technology, taxes, foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility, currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions, trade controls, tariffs, quotas, embargoes, or sanctions in the U.S. or other countries, complex economic sanctions, import and export controls, customs standards, additional security or workplace and transportation health and safety requirements, labor and employment standards (including with respect to our pilots), worker classification, joint employment and benefits, government contracting, regulated commodities, environmental or emission standards, and accounting may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, effective tax rate, and service levels. For additional discussion, see \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d of this Annual Report under the caption \u201cRegulation.\u201d Additionally, the current U.S. presidential administration and various U.S. federal and state regulatory bodies have indicated a desire to reform various aspects of existing laws, regulations, and enforcement priorities and strategies that could, among other things, lead to comprehensive tax reform, broadly increase the U.S. minimum wage, make it easier for unions to organize our U.S. employees or the employees of our service providers, and alter the employment relationship between service providers engaged by FedEx Ground and the drivers employed by those service providers.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.\n We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be enacted that could significantly affect our overall tax liabilities and our effective tax rate. U.S. and foreign governmental agencies maintain focus on the taxation of multinational companies, including statutory tax rates, global minimum taxes (such as the framework agreed to by members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2022), digital taxes, and transactions between affiliated companies. Such changes may require new and complex computations to be performed, significant judgments, estimates, and calculations to be made, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nStandard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of certain tax laws and regulations will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation, and we may be required to make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u2014Results of Operations and Outlook\u2014Consolidated Results\u2014Income Taxes\u201d of this Annual Report for additional information regarding ongoing tax examinations and challenges. Additionally, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u2014Critical Accounting Estimates\u2014Income Taxes\u201d of this Annual Report for information regarding estimates and potential adjustments related to our tax positions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- \n36\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection. \nThere has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection, use, retention, transfer, and processing of personal data in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and internationally, including the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, and other similar laws that have been or will be enacted by other jurisdictions. In addition, China and certain other jurisdictions have enacted more stringent data localization requirements. An actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection laws, regulations, or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation (including, in some instances, class action litigation), fines, sanctions, or other penalties, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. This regulatory environment is increasingly challenging, based on discretionary factors, and difficult to predict. Consequently, compliance with all applicable regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we do business may present material obligations and risks to our business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs, and enforcement risks; require us to make extensive system or operational changes; or adversely affect the cost or attractiveness of the services we offer. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements, as well as the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of laws, impose significant costs and regulatory risks that are likely to increase over time. Developing privacy legislation within the U.S. may also create limitations or added requirements on the use of personal data by FedEx Dataworks and the other FedEx operating companies.\n\n\nThe regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation rights may affect our operations and increase our operating costs.\n Our extensive air network is critical to our success. Our right to serve foreign points is subject to the approval of the DOT and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and foreign governments. In addition, we must obtain the permission of foreign governments to provide specific flights and services. Our operations outside of the U.S., such as FedEx Express\u2019s international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult, and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as FedEx Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market. Regulatory or executive actions affecting global aviation or transportation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation rights in important international markets could impair our ability to operate our networks. Further, our ability to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation rights internationally may be adversely affected by changes in international trade policies and relations.\n\n\nWe are subject to other extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that may result in significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures in order to comply. High-profile accidents, catastrophes, or incidents involving aircraft may trigger increased regulatory and legal compliance requirements. These requirements can be issued with little or no notice, or can otherwise affect our ability to efficiently or fully utilize our aircraft, and in some instances have resulted in the temporary grounding of aircraft types altogether. Further, our business may be adversely affected when government agencies and air traffic control and other systems they oversee cease to operate as expected, including due to partial shutdowns, sequestrations, or similar events. Lapses in government operations may result in, among other things, disruptions in the ability of government agencies to grant required regulatory approvals. For additional discussion, see \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d of this Annual Report under the caption \u201cRegulation.\u201d\n \n\n\nWe are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095   our ability to mitigate the technological, operational, legal and regulatory, and reputational risks related to autonomous technology and artificial intelligence;\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     the increasing costs of compliance with federal, state, and foreign governmental agency mandates (including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act) and defending against inappropriate or unjustified enforcement or other actions by such agencies;\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially in the euro, Chinese yuan, British pound, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, and Mexican peso, which can affect our sales levels and foreign currency sales prices;\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     loss or delay in the collection of accounts receivable;\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u0095     any liability resulting from and the costs of defending against class-action, derivative, and other litigation, such as wage-and-hour, joint employment, securities, vehicle accident, and discrimination and retaliation claims, claims related to our reporting and disclosure of climate change and other ESG topics, and any other legal or governmental proceedings, including the matters discussed in Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements included in \u201cItem 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\n\nWe provide a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services through companies competing collectively, operating collaboratively, and innovating digitally as one FedEx. Our primary operating companies are Federal Express Corporation (\u201cFedEx Express\u201d), the world\u2019s largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (\u201cFedEx Ground\u201d), a leading North American provider of small-package ground delivery services; and FedEx Freight Corporation (\u201cFedEx Freight\u201d), a leading North American provider of less-than-truckload (\u201cLTL\u201d) freight transportation services. These companies represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. (\u201cFedEx Services\u201d), constitute our reportable segments. Our FedEx Services segment provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services, and certain back-office functions that support our operating segments. The operating costs of the FedEx Services segment are allocated to the business units it serves. See \u201cReportable Segments\u201d for further discussion and refer to \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d for a more detailed description of each of our operating companies and information regarding our \u201cone FedEx\u201d consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and other FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation.\n \n\n\nThe key indicators necessary to understand our operating results include:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nthe overall customer demand for our various services based on macroeconomic factors and the global economy; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe volumes of transportation services provided through our networks, primarily measured by our average daily volume and shipment weight and size; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe mix of services purchased by our customers; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe prices we obtain for our services, primarily measured by yield (revenue per package or pound or revenue per shipment or hundredweight for LTL freight shipments); \n\n\n\u2022\nour ability to manage our cost structure (capital expenditures and operating expenses) to match shifting volume levels; and \n\n\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our ability to recover incremental fuel costs through our fuel surcharges. \n\n\nTrends Affecting Our Business\n\n\nThe following trends significantly impact the indicators discussed above, as well as our business and operating results. See the risk factors identified under Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for more information. Additionally, see \u201cResults of Operations and Outlook \u2013 Consolidated Results \u2013 Outlook\u201d and \u201cResults of Operations and Outlook \u2013 Financial Condition \u2013 Liquidity Outlook\u201d below for additional information on efforts we are taking to mitigate adverse trends.\n\n\nMacroeconomic Conditions\n\n\nWhile macroeconomic risks apply to most companies, we are particularly vulnerable. The transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trends in economic activity. Our primary business is to transport goods, so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production of goods and the rate of growth of global trade. Our results in 2023 were adversely impacted by lower global volumes due to weak economic conditions.\n \n\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic and Supply Chain\n\n\nThe coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic had varying impacts on the demand for our services and our business operations and has contributed to global supply chain disruptions. During the first half of 2023, we continued to be affected by COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia, which impacted both manufacturing and supply chains. We have now shifted to operating in a more stable post-COVID-19\n \n\n\n- \n46\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nenvironment with less restrictions, which resulted in consumers returning to near pre-pandemic shopping patterns during 2023. As global supply chains stabilized during 2023, we experienced improvements in the availability of labor and vehicles, trailers, and other package handling equipment.\n\n\nInflation and Interest Rates\n\n\nGlobal inflation is well above historical levels, impacting all areas of our business. Additionally, global interest rates continue to rise in an effort to curb inflation. We are experiencing a decline in demand for our transportation services as inflation and interest rate increases are negatively affecting consumer and business spending. Additionally, we are experiencing higher costs to serve through higher fuel prices, wage rates, purchased transportation costs, and other direct operating expenses such as operational supplies. We expect inflation and high interest rates to continue to negatively affect our results in 2024.\n \n\n\nFuel\n\n\nWe must purchase large quantities of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles, and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly volatile. The timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our ability to recover incremental fuel costs through our fuel surcharges can significantly affect our operating results either positively or negatively in the short-term. Higher fuel prices drove an increase in yields through higher fuel surcharges and an increase in fuel expense during 2023 at all of our transportation segments.\n\n\nGeopolitical Conflicts\n\n\nGiven the nature of our business and our global operations, geopolitical conflicts may adversely affect our business and results of operations. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in February 2022 continues as of the date of this Annual Report. The safety of our team members in Ukraine is our top priority. As we focus on the safety of our team members, we have suspended all services in Ukraine and Belarus. We also temporarily idled our operations in Russia and reduced our presence to the minimum required for purposes of maintaining a legal presence with active transport licenses. As a result, we incurred an immaterial amount of severance and other related expenses in 2023, which is included in business optimization expenses at FedEx Express. While we do not expect this conflict to have a direct material impact on our business or results of operations, the broader consequences are adversely affecting the global economy and fuel prices generally and may also have the effect of heightening other risks disclosed under Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d See \u201cResults of Operations and Outlook \u2013 Consolidated Results \u2013 Business Optimization and Realignment Costs\u201d below for additional information.\n\n\n- \n47\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRESULTS OF O\nPERATIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\n\nMany of our operating expenses are directly affected by revenue and volume levels, and we expect these operating expenses to fluctuate on a year-over-year basis consistent with changes in revenue and volumes. Therefore, the discussion of operating expense captions focuses on the key drivers and trends affecting expenses other than those factors strictly related to changes in revenue and volumes. The line item \u201cOther operating expense\u201d includes costs associated with outside service contracts (such as temporary labor, security, and facility services and cargo handling), insurance, professional fees, operational supplies, and bad debt.\n \n\n\nExcept as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 or ended May 31 of the year referenced, and comparisons are to the corresponding period of the prior year. References to our transportation segments include, collectively, the FedEx Express segment, the FedEx Ground segment, and the FedEx Freight segment.\n \n\n\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n \n\n\nThe following

global interest rates. In response to market conditions, we implemented cost reductions and focused on yield improvement to partially mitigate the effect of volume declines. Cost reductions included reducing flight hours, temporarily parking and retiring aircraft, improving productivity, delaying and reducing certain peak wage programs, consolidating and closing sorts, canceling network capacity projects, and reducing select Sunday operations. The impact of cost actions lagged volume declines, particularly in the first half of 2023 and at FedEx Express, resulting in elevated operating expenses relative to demand. Additionally, our results in the first half of 2023 were negatively impacted by service challenges at FedEx Express.\n\n\nOperating income in 2023 includes $70 million ($54 million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) of asset impairment charges associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines at FedEx Express, and also includes $47 million ($44 million, net of tax, or $0.17 per diluted share) of goodwill and other asset impairment charges associated with the ShopRunner, Inc. (\u201cShopRunner\u201d) acquisition at FedEx Dataworks, Inc. (\u201cFedEx Dataworks\u201d). See the \u201cGoodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges\u201d section of this MD&A for more information.\n\n\nOperating income in 2023 includes $273 million ($209 million, net of tax, or $0.81 per diluted share) of expenses associated with our DRIVE business optimization strategy announced in the first quarter of 2023, and also includes business realignment costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) associated with our workforce reduction plan in Europe announced in 2021. Operating income in 2022 includes $278 million ($214 million, net of tax, or $0.80 per diluted share) of costs under this program. See the \u201cBusiness Optimization and Realignment Costs\u201d section of this MD&A for more information.\n\n\nOperating income includes a $35 million charge ($26 million, net of tax, or $0.10 per diluted share) in 2023 related to a FedEx Ground legal matter and a $210 million charge ($160 million, net of tax, or $0.60 per diluted share) in 2022 related to pre- and post-judgment interest in connection with a separate FedEx Ground legal matter. The amounts are included in \u201cCorporate, other, and eliminations.\u201d\n \n\n\nOperating expenses in 2022 include $132 million ($103 million, net of tax, or $0.39 per diluted share) of TNT Express integration expenses.\n\n\nNet income includes a pre-tax, noncash gain of $650 million in 2023 ($493 million, net of tax, or $1.92 per diluted share) and a loss of $1.6 billion in 2022 ($1.2 billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share) associated with our MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments. See the \u201cRetirement Plans MTM Adjustments\u201d section of this MD&A and Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n \n\n\nNet income in 2023 includes a $46 million ($0.18 per diluted share) tax expense from a revaluation of certain foreign tax assets. In 2022, we recognized a $142 million ($0.53 per diluted share) tax benefit related to revisions of prior-year tax estimates for actual tax return results. See the \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d section of this MD&A and Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n \n\n\nIn December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $5 billion of FedEx common stock. As part of the repurchase program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (\u201cASR\u201d) agreement with a bank in October 2022, which was completed in December 2022, to repurchase an aggregate of $1.5 billion of our common stock. Share repurchases had a benefit of $0.34 per diluted share in 2023. See Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the \u201cFinancial Condition\u2014Liquidity\u201d section of this MD&A for additional information on our stock repurchase program.\n\n\n- \n49\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following graphs for FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight show selected volume trends (in thousands) for the years ended May 31:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1)\nInternational domestic average daily package volume relates to our international intra-country operations.

Revenue at Corporate, other, and eliminations decreased due to lower yields and volumes at FedEx Trade Networks Transport & Brokerage, Inc. FedEx Ground revenue and FedEx Freight revenue each increased 1% in 2023, primarily due to yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges, partially offset by lower volume.\n \n\n\nGoodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and 25 related engines, four Boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft and eight related engines, to align with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter. All of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in revenue service.\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we also recorded a noncash impairment charge of $36 million ($36 million, net of tax, or $0.14 per diluted share) for all of the goodwill attributable to FedEx Dataworks. The key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the ShopRunner business during 2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition. Based on these factors, our outlook for the business changed in the fourth quarter of 2023. We also recorded an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) noncash intangible asset impairment charge related to the ShopRunner acquisition at FedEx Dataworks. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, see the \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d section of this MD&A and Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nBusiness Optimization and Realignment Costs\n\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve the company\u2019s long-term profitability. This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments and lower our overhead and support costs. We plan to consolidate our sortation facilities and equipment, reduce pickup-and-delivery routes, and optimize our enterprise linehaul network by moving beyond discrete collaboration to an end-to-end optimized network through Network 2.0.\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and other FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight will continue to provide LTL freight transportation services as a stand-alone and separate company under Federal Express Corporation. The organizational redesign will be implemented in phases with full implementation expected in June 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability.\n\n\nWe have announced the implementation of Network 2.0 in more than 20 markets, including the phased transition of all FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to FedEx Express beginning in April 2024. Under Network 2.0, FedEx will continue to utilize both employees and contracted service providers.\n\n\nWe incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $273 million ($209 million, net of tax, or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. These costs were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia. These business optimization costs are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. The identification of these costs as business optimization-related expenditures is subject to our disclosure controls and procedures. We expect the pre-tax cost of our business optimization activities to be approximately $500 million in 2024 and approximately $2.0 billion through 2025. The timing and amount of our business optimization expenses may change as we revise and implement our plans.\n\n\nIn 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express. The plan affected approximately 5,000 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions and was completed during 2023. We incurred costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) in 2023 and $278 million ($214 million, net of tax, or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 associated with our business realignment activities. These costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. Payments under this program totaled approximately $118 million in 2023 and approximately $225 million in 2022. The pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities was approximately $430 million through 2023. We expect savings from our business realignment activities to be approximately $275 million on an annualized basis beginning in 2024.\n\n\n- \n52\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOperating Expenses\n \n\n\nThe following table compares operating expenses expressed as dollar amounts (in millions) and as a percent of revenue for the years ended May 31:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPercent\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPercent of Revenue\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2022\n(1)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2022\n(1)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating expenses:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalaries and employee benefits\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n31,019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n32,058\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(3\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n34.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n34.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchased transportation\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n21,790\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n24,118\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(10\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n24.2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n25.8\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRentals and landing fees\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4,738\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4,712\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5.3\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4,176\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3,970\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4.6\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuel\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5,909\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5,115\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n16\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintenance and repairs\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3,357\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3,372\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodwill and other asset impairment charges\n(2)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n117\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNM\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness optimization and realignment costs\n(3)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n309\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n278\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n(4)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13,828\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13,644\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n15.3\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n14.6\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n85,243\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n87,267\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n94.6\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n93.3\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal operating income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,912\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n6,245\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(21\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1)\nIncludes TNT Express integration expenses of $132 million in 2022.\n\n\n(2)\nIncludes goodwill and other asset impairment charges in 2023 associated with the FedEx Express and FedEx Dataworks operating segments.\n\n\n(3)\nIncludes costs associated with our DRIVE program in 2023 and the workforce reduction plan in Europe in 2023 and 2022. \n\n\n(4)\nIncludes a $35 million charge in 2023 related to a FedEx Ground legal matter and a $210 million charge in 2022 related to pre- and post-judgment interest in connection with a separate FedEx Ground legal matter.\n\n\nOperating income declined in 2023 primarily due to lower volumes at each of our transportation segments, partially offset by yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges. Cost reduction efforts such as reducing flight hours, temporarily parking and retiring aircraft, improving productivity, delaying and reducing certain peak wage programs, consolidating and closing sorts, canceling network capacity projects, and reducing select Sunday operations partially mitigated the effects of volume declines on our results.\n \n\n\nGlobal inflation drove higher operating expenses related to salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses in 2023. In addition, higher self-insurance and bad debt accruals contributed to an increase in other operating expense in 2023.\n\n\nWe recognized $70 million of asset impairment charges associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines at FedEx Express. Our 2023 results also include $47 million of goodwill and other asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2023 associated with the ShopRunner acquisition at FedEx Dataworks. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, see the \u201cGoodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d sections of this MD&A and Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nFuel\n \n\n\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our air and ground services, most of which are adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from ten days prior to the week in which it is assessed. Some FedEx Express international fuel surcharges are updated on a monthly basis. We routinely review our fuel surcharges and periodically update the tables used to determine our fuel surcharges at all of our transportation segments.\n \n\n\nWhile fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield. Additional components include the mix of services sold, the base price, and extra service charges we obtain for these services and level of pricing discounts offered.\n \n\n\nFuel expense increased 16% during 2023 due to higher fuel prices, partially offset by a decline in fuel usage. In addition to variability in usage and market prices, the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences our results. For example, our contracts for jet fuel purchases at FedEx Express are tied to various indices, including the U.S. Gulf Coast index. While many of these indices are aligned, each index may fluctuate at a different pace, driving variability in the prices paid for jet fuel. Furthermore, under these contractual arrangements, approximately 70% of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week, with the remainder of our purchases tied primarily to the index price for the preceding month and preceding day, rather than based on daily spot rates. These contractual provisions mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rates on our jet fuel purchases.\n \n\n\n- \n53\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause of the factors described above, our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges, which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short-term. For more information, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\n\n\nOther Income and Expense\n \n\n\nOther retirement plans income (expense) increased primarily due to a noncash MTM gain of $650 million in 2023 compared to a $1.6 billion loss in 2022 (described below). In addition, interest income increased $145 million in 2023 primarily due to an increase in interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in other income of $120 million related to changes in the value of equity investments.\n \n\n\nRetirement Plans MTM Adjustments\n \n\n\nIn 2023, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash MTM gain of $650 million ($493 million, net of tax, or $1.92 per diluted share), related to the year-end actuarial adjustments of pension and postretirement healthcare plans\u2019 assets and liabilities. These actuarial adjustments were due to higher discount rates, partially offset by lower than expected asset returns and demographic experience.\n\n\nIn 2022, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash MTM loss of $1.6 billion ($1.2 billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share), which includes a net loss of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion, net of tax, or $3.76 per diluted share) related to the year-end actuarial adjustments of pension and postretirement healthcare plans\u2019 assets and liabilities. These actuarial adjustments were due to lower than expected asset returns, demographic experience, and an update to the mortality assumption, partially offset by higher discount rates.\n\n\nAdditionally, in 2022, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash MTM net loss of $260 million ($195 million, net of tax, or $0.73 per diluted share) in the second quarter of 2022, of which $224 million was related to the termination of the TNT Express Netherlands Pension Plan. Effective October 1, 2021, the responsibility of all pension assets and liabilities of this plan was transferred to a separate, multi-employer pension plan. The remaining $36 million net loss was related to the U.S. FedEx Freight Pension Plan and consisted of a $75 million MTM loss due to a lower discount rate in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by a $39 million curtailment gain.\n\n\nFor more information, see the \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d section of this MD&A and Note 1 and Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n \n\n\nIncome Taxes\n \n\n\nOur effective tax rate was 25.9% for 2023, compared to 21.9% for 2022. The 2023 tax provision was negatively impacted by an expense of $46 million related to a write-down and valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credit carryforwards due to operational changes which impacted the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax asset. The 2023 tax provision was also negatively impacted by lower earnings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n\nThe 2022 tax provision includes a benefit of $142 million related to revisions of prior year tax estimates for actual tax return results. The 2022 tax provision was also favorably impacted by changes in our corporate legal entity structure.\n \n\n\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various U.S. state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) for the 2016 through 2019 tax years. It is reasonably possible that certain income tax return proceedings will be completed during the next 12 months and could result in a change in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits. However, we believe we have recorded adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, for any adjustments expected to occur.\n \n\n\nDuring 2021, we filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee challenging the validity of a tax regulation related to the one-time transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, which was enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d). Our lawsuit seeks to have the court declare this regulation invalid and order the refund of overpayments of U.S. federal income taxes for 2018 and 2019 attributable to the denial of foreign tax credits under the regulation. We have recorded a cumulative benefit of $223 million through 2023 attributable to our interpretation of the TCJA and the Internal Revenue Code. On March 31, 2023, the District Court ruled that the regulation is invalid and contradicts the plain terms of the tax code. We continue to work towards obtaining a final judgment for the applicable refund amounts due to the regulation being invalid. Once the District Court enters a final judgment, the U.S. government could file an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, we may be required to reverse the benefit previously recorded.\n\n\nFor more information on income taxes, see the \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d section of this MD&A and Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n \n\n\n- \n54\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEquity Investment\n\n\nAs of May 31, 2023, we do not have any equity investments that are material to our financial position or results of operations. For more information on equity investments, see Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nOutlook\n\n\nDuring 2024, we expect macroeconomic conditions to continue to negatively impact customer demand for our services. However, we expect operating income improvement in 2024 as a result of our DRIVE program initiatives focused on aligning our cost base with demand, reducing our permanent cost structure, and increasing the flexibility of our network. We expect international export yield declines and reduced customer demand for our U.S. freight product at FedEx Express to negatively impact revenue and operating income in 2024. In addition, we expect expense headwinds in 2024 related to higher global inflation and variable incentive compensation.\n\n\nSee the \u201cBusiness Optimization and Realignment Costs\u201d section of this MD&A for additional information on our DRIVE program and other cost savings initiatives.\n\n\nOur capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion, a decrease of $0.5 billion from 2023, as we continue to reduce our capital intensity relative to revenue. We expect lower aircraft spend and reduced capacity investment to be partially offset by investments to optimize our networks and modernize our facilities. Our expected capital expenditures for 2024 include our continued investments in the expansion and modernization of the FedEx Express Indianapolis hub and modernization of the FedEx Express Memphis World Hub.\n\n\nWe will continue to evaluate our investments in critical long-term strategic projects to ensure our capital expenditures are expected to generate high returns on investment and are balanced with our outlook for global economic conditions. For additional details on key 2024 capital projects, refer to the \u201cFinancial Condition \u2013 Capital Resources\u201d and \u201cFinancial Condition \u2013 Liquidity Outlook\u201d sections of this MD&A.\n\n\nThe uncertainty of a slowing global economy, global inflation well above historical levels, geopolitical challenges including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the impact these factors will have on the rate of growth of global trade, supply chains, fuel prices, and our business in particular, make any expectations for 2024 inherently less certain. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for more information.\n\n\nSee \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d, \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d, \u201cTrends Affecting Our Business\u201d, and \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d for a discussion of these and other potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance.\n\n\nSeasonality of Business\n \n\n\nOur businesses are cyclical in nature, as seasonal fluctuations affect volumes, revenue, and earnings. Historically, the U.S. express package business experiences an increase in volumes in late November and December. International business, particularly in the Asia-to-U.S. market, peaks in October and November in advance of the U.S. holiday sales season. Our first and third fiscal quarters, because they are summer vacation and post winter-holiday seasons, have historically experienced lower volumes relative to other periods. Normally, the fall is the busiest shipping period for FedEx Ground, while late December, June and July are the slowest periods. For FedEx Freight, the spring and fall are the busiest periods and the latter part of December through February is the slowest period. Shipment levels, operating costs, and earnings for each of our companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather, particularly the impact of severe winter weather in our third fiscal quarter. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for more information.\n\n\nRECENT ACCOUN\nTING GUIDANCE\n \n\n\nSee Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance.\n\n\n- \n55\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nREPORTABLE\n SEGMENTS\n \n\n\nFedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Services, constitute our reportable segments.

The organizational redesign will be implemented in phases with full implementation expected in June 2024. During the implementation process in fiscal 2024, each of our current reportable segments will continue to have discrete financial information that will be regularly reviewed when evaluating performance and making resource allocation decisions, and aligns with our management reporting structure and our internal financial reporting. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, when the consolidation plan has been completed, we expect to begin reporting a resegmented structure that will align with an updated management reporting structure and how management will evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions under one FedEx.\n\n\nFEDEX SERVI\nCES SEGMENT\n\n\nThe FedEx Services segment provides direct and indirect support to our operating segments, and we allocate all of the net operating costs of the FedEx Services segment to reflect the full cost of operating our businesses in the results of those segments. We review and evaluate the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income (inclusive of FedEx Services segment allocations). For the FedEx Services segment, performance is evaluated based on the effect of its total allocated net operating costs on our operating segments.\n \n\n\nOperating expenses for each of our transportation segments include the allocations from the FedEx Services segment to the respective transportation segments. These allocations include charges and credits for administrative services provided between operating companies. The allocations of net operating costs are based on metrics such as relative revenue or estimated services provided. We believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions. Our allocation methodologies are refined periodically, as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses.\n\n\nCOR\nPORATE, OTHER, AND ELIMINATIONS\n\n\nCorporate and other includes corporate headquarters costs for executive officers and certain legal and finance functions, including certain other costs and credits not attributed to our core business, as well as certain costs associated with developing our \u201cinnovate digitally\u201d strategic pillar through our FedEx Dataworks operating segment. FedEx Dataworks is focused on creating solutions to transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members. ShopRunner, Inc. was merged into FedEx Dataworks during 2023.\n\n\nAlso included in Corporate and other is the FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. operating segment, which provides an array of document and business services and retail access to our customers for our package transportation businesses, and the FedEx Logistics, Inc. operating segment, which provides integrated supply chain management solutions, specialty transportation, customs brokerage, and global ocean and air freight forwarding.\n \n\n\nThe results of Corporate, other, and eliminations are not allocated to the other business segments.\n\n\n- \n56\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 2023, the decrease in operating results in Corporate, other, and eliminations was primarily due to lower operating income at FedEx Logistics due to decreased revenue and an increase in bad debt, partially offset by decreased purchased transportation expense. Additionally, operating results in Corporate, other, and eliminations were negatively impacted by higher professional fees and outside service contract spend at FedEx Dataworks. The comparison of operating loss between 2023 and 2022 at Corporate, other, and eliminations is affected by goodwill and other asset impairment charges of $47 million associated with the ShopRunner acquisition at FedEx Dataworks in 2023.\n\n\nCertain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx companies outside their reportable segment in order to optimize our resources. For example, during 2023 FedEx Ground provided delivery support for certain FedEx Express packages as part of our last-mile optimization efforts, and FedEx Freight provided road and intermodal support for both FedEx Ground and FedEx Express. In addition, FedEx Express is working with FedEx Logistics to secure air charters and other cargo space for U.S. customers. Billings for such services are based on negotiated rates, which we believe approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenue of the billing segment. These rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. Such intersegment revenue and expenses are eliminated in our consolidated results and are not separately identified in the following segment information because the amounts are not material.\n\n\n- \n57\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFEDEX EXPRES\nS SEGMENT\n \n\n\nFedEx Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight including priority, deferred, and economy services, which provide delivery on a time-definite or day-definite basis.

to our international intra-country operations.\n\n\nFedEx Express Segment Revenue\n\n\nFedEx Express segment revenue decreased 7% in 2023 primarily due to decreased global volume and unfavorable exchange rates, partially offset by yield improvement.\n\n\nTotal average daily package volume decreased 10% in 2023, and total average daily freight pounds decreased 14% in 2023, due to reduced demand for our services, primarily resulting from macroeconomic conditions. Volume declines were partially offset by yield improvement, including increases in composite package yield of 6% and composite freight yield of 2% in 2023. The 6% increase in composite package yield was primarily due to a U.S. domestic package yield increase of 12%, driven by higher base yields and fuel surcharges. Unfavorable exchange rates negatively impacted all international package and freight product yields in 2023.\n\n\nFedEx Express Segment Operating Income\n \n\n\nFedEx Express segment operating income decreased 64% in 2023 primarily due to global volume declines, partially offset by yield improvement and lower operating expenses. During 2023, we implemented cost reductions to mitigate the impact of volume declines, including reducing flight hours, temporarily parking and retiring aircraft, improving productivity, and consolidating routes and closing sorts. The impact of these reductions, while improving throughout the year, lagged volume declines, and operating expenses remained high relative to demand. Currency exchange rates had a negative effect on revenue and a positive effect on expenses, resulting in a slightly negative effect on operating income in 2023.\n \n\n\n- \n59\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFuel expense increased 16% in 2023 due to a 27% increase in fuel prices, partially offset by a 9% decline in total fuel gallons. Purchased transportation expense decreased 11% in 2023 primarily due to favorable exchange rates and lower utilization, partially offset by higher rates charged by third-party providers. Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 3% in 2023 primarily due to decreased staffing to align with lower volume, favorable currency exchange rates, and lower variable incentive compensation, partially offset by increased wage rates. Rentals and landing fees expense decreased 10% in 2023 primarily due to decreased aircraft leases and favorable currency exchange rates. Other operating expense decreased 2% in 2023 primarily due to favorable currency exchange rates and lower outside service contract expense, partially offset by higher bad debt expense. Maintenance and repairs expense decreased 6% in 2023 primarily due to lower aircraft maintenance resulting from an increase in aircraft temporarily parked.\n\n\nDuring 2023, we recorded asset impairment charges of $70 million associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines. See \u201cGoodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges\u201d above for more information. Additionally, FedEx Express segment results include business realignment costs of $36 million in 2023 associated with our workforce reduction plan in Europe. We recognized $278 million of costs in 2022 under this program. FedEx Express segment results also include business optimization costs of $11 million in 2023, which includes costs associated with idling our business in Russia. See the \u201cBusiness Optimization and Realignment Costs\u201d section of this MD&A for more information.\n \n\n\nFedEx Express segments results include $115 million of TNT Express integration expenses in 2022.\n\n\nFEDEX GROUN\nD SEGMENT\n \n\n\nFedEx Ground service offerings include day-certain delivery to businesses in the U.S. and Canada and to 100% of U.S. residences.

revenue increased 1% in 2023 primarily due to yield improvement, partially offset by lower volumes.\n\n\nFedEx Ground yield increased 10% in 2023 primarily due to higher fuel and other surcharges, and a mix shift towards higher-yielding business-to-consumer products. Total average daily volume decreased 7% in 2023 due to reduced demand for our services, primarily resulting from macroeconomic conditions.\n\n\n- \n60\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Ground Segment Operating Income\n \n\n\nFedEx Ground segment operating income increased 19% in 2023 primarily due to yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges, partially offset by lower volume and higher other operating and rentals expense. The 2023 results benefited from certain cost reductions to mitigate the effect of volume declines, primarily a delay and reduction in peak wage programs, the consolidation and closing of certain sort and linehaul operations, cancellation of network capacity projects, and reduced Sunday delivery coverage.\n \n\n\nPurchased transportation expense decreased 4% in 2023 primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by lower productivity and higher fuel prices. Salaries and employee benefits decreased 5% in 2023 primarily due to decreased staffing to align with lower volume and lower variable incentive compensation, partially offset by higher wage rates. Other operating expense increased 11% in 2023 primarily due to higher self-insurance accruals and higher outside service contracts expense. Rentals and depreciation expense increased 18% and 11%, respectively, in 2023 due to the completion of previously committed multi-year expansion projects.\n\n\nFEDEX FREIGH\nT SEGMENT\n \n\n\nFedEx Freight LTL service offerings include priority services when speed is critical and economy services when time can be traded for savings.

increased 14% in 2023 primarily due to continued focus on revenue quality, including higher fuel surcharges, partially offset by lower weight per shipment. Average daily shipments decreased 11% in 2023 due to reduced demand for our services, primarily resulting from macroeconomic conditions.\n \n\n\n- \n61\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFedEx Freight Segment Operating Income\n \n\n\nFedEx Freight segment operating income increased 16% in 2023 driven by yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges, partially offset by lower volumes. Additionally, FedEx Freight results were positively affected by initiatives to align costs to volumes and a gain on the sale of a facility during the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\nIn 2023, FedEx Freight continued to manage linehaul costs by increasing utilization of company linehaul, resulting in a shift of costs from purchased transportation to salaries and employee benefits expense. Purchased transportation expense decreased 25% in 2023 primarily due to lower volumes and reduced utilization due to the shift to company linehaul. Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 3% in 2023 primarily due to decreased staffing to align with lower volume and lower variable incentive compensation, partially offset by higher wage rates and increased company linehaul utilization. Fuel expense increased 13% in 2023 primarily due to increased fuel prices, partially offset by lower volume.

We held $6.9 billion in cash at May 31, 2023 and have $3.5 billion in available liquidity under our $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (the \u201cFive-Year Credit Agreement) and $1.5 billion three-year credit agreement (the \u201cThree-Year Credit Agreement\u201d and together with the Five-Year Credit Agreement, the \u201cCredit Agreements\u201d), and we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and available financing sources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs, which include operational requirements, expected capital expenditures, voluntary pension contributions, dividend payments, and stock repurchases.\n\n\n- \n64\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs announced on June 20, 2023, we expect to repurchase $2.0 billion of our common stock in 2024. We executed an ASR agreement with a bank in June 2023 to repurchase an aggregate of $500 million of our common stock with a completion date no later than August 2023.\n\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance at May 31, 2023 includes $2.6 billion of cash in foreign jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy. We are able to access the majority of this cash without a material tax cost and do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds impairs our ability to meet our U.S. domestic debt or working capital obligations.\n\n\nOur capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion, a decrease of $0.5 billion from 2023, as we continue to reduce our capital intensity relative to revenue. We expect lower aircraft spend and reduced capacity investment to be partially offset by investments to optimize our networks and modernize our facilities. Included within our expected 2024 capital expenditures are our continued investments in the expansion and modernization of the FedEx Express Indianapolis hub and modernization of the FedEx Express Memphis World Hub, which are expected to total $1.5 billion each over the life of each project. Our expected capital expenditures for 2024 also include $1.5 billion for delivery of aircraft and related equipment and progress payments toward future aircraft deliveries at FedEx Express.\n \n\n\nWe have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures, which consist of debt obligations, lease obligations, and obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. Refer to Note 6, Note 7, and Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information. In addition, we have certain tax positions that are further discussed in Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We do not have any guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.\n \n\n\nWe have several aircraft modernization programs under way that are supported by the purchase of Boeing 777 Freighter and Boeing 767-300 Freighter aircraft. These aircraft are significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized, and these expenditures are necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to replace older aircraft. Our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft-related expenditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements.\n \n\n\nWe have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) that allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock and allows pass-through trusts formed by FedEx Express to sell, in one or more future offerings, pass-through certificates.\n\n\nThe Five-Year Credit Agreement expires in March 2026 and includes a $250 million letter of credit sublimit. The Three-Year Credit Agreement expires in March 2025. The Credit Agreements are available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs. See Note 6 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the terms and significant covenants of the Credit Agreements.\n \n\n\nWe made a voluntary contribution of $200 million to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans (\u201cU.S. Pension Plans\u201d) in June 2023 and anticipate making $600 million of additional voluntary contributions during the remainder of 2024. There are currently no required minimum contributions to our U.S. Pension Plans based on current funded status and credit balance due to cumulative excess voluntary pension contributions, which exceeds $3.0 billion. The credit balance is subtracted from plan assets to determine the minimum funding requirements. Therefore, we could eliminate all required contributions to our principal U.S. Pension Plans for several years if we were to choose to waive part of that credit balance in any given year. Our U.S. Pension Plans have ample funds to meet expected benefit payments.\n \n\n\nOn April 5, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.26 per share of common stock. The dividend was paid on July 3, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 12, 2023. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis. There are no material restrictions on our ability to declare dividends, nor are there any material restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances.\n\n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s has assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of BBB, a Certificates rating of AA-, a commercial paper rating of A-2, and a ratings outlook of \u201cstable.\u201d Moody\u2019s Investors Service has assigned us an unsecured debt credit rating of Baa2, a Certificates rating of Aa3, a commercial paper rating of P-2, and a ratings outlook of \u201cstable.\u201d If our credit ratings drop, our interest expense may increase. If our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels, we may have difficulty utilizing the commercial paper market. If our senior unsecured debt credit ratings drop below investment grade, our access to financing may become limited.\n \n\n\n- \n65\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNT\nING ESTIMATES\n \n\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a complex, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and new or better information.\n \n\n\nThe estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our results of operations and financial condition. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm.\n \n\n\nRETIREME\nNT PLANS\n\n\nThe rules for pension accounting are complex and can produce volatility in our earnings, financial condition, and liquidity. Our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured using actuarial techniques that reflect management\u2019s assumptions for expected returns on assets (\u201cEROA\u201d), discount rate, and demographic experience such as salary increases, expected retirement, mortality, employee turnover, and future increases in healthcare costs. Differences between these assumptions and actual experience are recognized in our earnings through MTM accounting.

Our income taxes are a function of our income, tax planning opportunities available to us, statutory tax rates, and the income tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by us and the respective governmental taxing authorities. As a result, significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. Also, our effective tax rate is significantly affected by the earnings generated in each jurisdiction, so unexpected fluctuations in the geographic mix of earnings could significantly impact our tax rate. Our intercompany transactions are based on globally accepted transfer pricing principles, which align profits with the business operations and functions of the various legal entities in our international business.\n \n\n\nWe evaluate our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. These evaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax laws or their interpretations, audit activity, and changes in our business. In addition, management considers the advice of third parties in making conclusions regarding tax consequences.\n \n\n\nTax contingencies arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rules throughout the many jurisdictions in which we operate. Despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management\u2019s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on the technical merits. The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement.\n \n\n\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates to make this determination, and as a result there is a risk that these estimates will have to be revised as new information is received. To the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. We believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets that are not subject to valuation allowances. We record the taxes for global intangible low-taxed income as a period cost.\n\n\nOur income tax positions are based on currently enacted tax laws. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.\n \n\n\nFor more information, see the \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d section of this MD&A and Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n \n\n\nSELF-INSURAN\nCE ACCRUALS\n \n\n\nOur self-insurance reserves are established for estimates of ultimate loss on all incurred claims, including incurred-but-not-reported claims. Components of our self-insurance reserves included in this critical accounting estimate are workers\u2019 compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. These reserves are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. These estimates include judgment about severity of claims, frequency and volume of claims, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs. The use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known, which may be several years.\n\n\nWe believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in  accident frequency and severity, healthcare costs, insurance retention levels, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities and affect our results of operations. Self-insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet for the period ended May 31 are as follows (in millions):\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort-Term\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,730\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,646\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-Term\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3,339\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,889\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Total\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n5,069\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,535\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- \n67\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA five-percent reduction or improvement in the assumed claim severity used to estimate our self-insurance accruals would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $250 million in our reserves and expenses as of and for the year ended May 31, 2023. For more information, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.\n\n\nLONG-LIVED\n ASSETS\n \n\n\nUSEFUL LIVES AND SALVAGE VALUES\n. Our business is capital intensive, with approximately 60% of our owned assets invested in our transportation and information system infrastructures.\n \n\n\nThe depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 30 years), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset. These evaluations consider usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors that affect the useful life of an asset. This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment.\n \n\n\nFor our aircraft, we consider actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and future volume projections in estimating the useful lives and expected salvage values. We typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of our aircraft in cargo configuration, which results in little to no value at the end of their useful life. These estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. Changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods and could have a material impact on our results of operations (as described below). Historically, gains and losses on disposals of operating equipment have not been material. However, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to changes in business levels, technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory changes, and other factors beyond our control.\n \n\n\nIMPAIRMENT.\n As of May 31, 2023, the FedEx Express global air network included a fleet of 700 aircraft (including 293 supplemental aircraft) that provide delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through a wide range of U.S. and international shipping services. While certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic areas (U.S. versus international), we operate an integrated global network, and utilize our aircraft and other modes of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitments to our customers. Because of the integrated nature of our global network, our aircraft are interchangeable across routes and geographies, giving us flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic conditions and maintain and modify aircraft as needed.\n \n\n\nBecause of the lengthy lead times for aircraft manufacture and modifications, we must anticipate volume levels and plan our fleet requirements years in advance, and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. Furthermore, the timing and availability of certain used aircraft types (particularly those with better fuel efficiency) may create limited opportunities to acquire these aircraft at favorable prices in advance of our capacity needs. These activities create risks that asset capacity may exceed demand. At May 31, 2023, we had three purchased aircraft that were not yet placed into service.\n \n\n\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by that asset group are less than the carrying amounts of the asset group and may not be recoverable. If the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value. We operate integrated transportation networks, and accordingly, cash flows for most of our operating assets are assessed at a network level, not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment. Further, decisions about capital investments are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset. We make decisions to remove certain long-lived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs or lower operating costs of newer aircraft types, and those decisions may result in an impairment charge. Assets held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values less costs to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criteria are met. The fair value determinations for such aircraft may require management estimates, as there may not be active markets for some of these aircraft. Such estimates are subject to revision from period to period.\n \n\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and 25 related engines, four Boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft and eight related engines, to align with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter. All of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in revenue service.\n\n\nIn addition, in the fourth quarter of 2023, FedEx Express made the decision to accelerate the retirement of 46 MD-11F aircraft and related engines to aid in our fleet modernization, improve our global network, and better align air network capacity of FedEx Express to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a result of this decision, we expect a net increase of approximately $12 million in depreciation expense in 2024 with the expense impact in 2025 being immaterial.\n \n\n\n- \n68\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the normal management of our aircraft fleet, we routinely idle aircraft and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and adjustments of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand levels. Temporarily idled assets are classified as available-for-use, and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these assets. These temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment and remaining life on a quarterly basis. The criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently removed from service (and, as a result, is potentially impaired) include, but are not limited to, our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels, including capacity needs during our peak shipping seasons; the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations; and changes to planned service expansion activities. At May 31, 2023, we had 11 aircraft temporarily idled. These aircraft have been idled for an average of five months and are expected to return to revenue service in order to meet expected demand.\n \n\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we reviewed long-lived assets at FedEx Dataworks for impairment. Based on our reviews, we recognized an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) asset impairment charge related to an intangible asset from the ShopRunner acquisition. For more information, see Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nLEASES\n. We utilize operating leases to finance certain of our aircraft, facilities, and equipment. Such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor. In accordance with the new lease accounting standard adopted in 2020, we had $18 billion in operating lease liabilities and $17 billion in related right-of-use assets on the balance sheet as of May 31, 2023. The weighted-average remaining lease term of all operating leases outstanding at May 31, 2023 was 9.5 years.\n \n\n\nOur leases generally contain options to extend or terminate the lease. We reevaluate our leases on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options, and how they align with our operating strategy. Therefore, substantially all the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the options to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized in the right-to-use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets.\n \n\n\nThe lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which we would borrow, on a collateralized basis, over the term of a lease in the applicable currency environment. The interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where we are the lessee.\n\n\nThe determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a finance lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life. In addition, our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build-to-suit lease arrangements and making judgments about whether various forms of lessee involvement during the construction period allow the lessee to control the underlying leased asset during the construction period. We believe we have well-defined and controlled processes for making these evaluations, including obtaining third-party appraisals for material transactions to assist us in making these evaluations.\n \n\n\nGOODWILL\n. We had $6.4 billion of recorded goodwill at May 31, 2023 and $6.5 billion of recorded goodwill at May 31, 2022 from our business acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the expected benefits from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business.\n \n\n\nGoodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimates to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. An entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. We performed both qualitative and quantitative assessments of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022. This included comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies (principally the income or market approach classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy) incorporating market participant considerations and management\u2019s assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, and expected capital expenditures. Estimates used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test. Changes in forecasted operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates.\n \n\n\nAs part of our qualitative assessment, we consider changes in the macroeconomic environment such as the general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and other developments in equity and credit markets.\n \n\n\n- \n69\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe market approach uses observable market data of comparable public companies to estimate fair value utilizing financial metrics such as operating value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We apply judgment to select appropriate comparison companies based on the business operations, growth, size, and risk profile relative to our reporting units. Changes to our selection of comparable companies may result in changes to the estimates of fair value of our reporting units.\n\n\nIn connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded an impairment charge of $36 million ($36 million, net of tax, or $0.14 per diluted share) for all of the goodwill attributable to our FedEx Dataworks reporting unit. The key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the ShopRunner business during 2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition. Based on these factors, our outlook for the business changed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\nOur other reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight. We evaluated these reporting units during the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of the end of 2023 and 2022; therefore, we do not believe that any of these reporting units were impaired as of the balance sheet dates.\n\n\nLEGAL AND OTHER\n \nCONTINGE\nNCIES\n \n\n\nWe are subject to various loss contingencies in connection with our operations. Contingent liabilities are difficult to measure, as their measurement is subject to multiple factors that are not easily predicted or projected. Further, additional complexity in measuring these liabilities arises due to the various jurisdictions in which these matters occur, which makes our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain. Moreover, different accounting rules must be employed to account for these items based on the nature of the contingency. Accordingly, significant management judgment is required to assess these matters and to make determinations about the measurement of a liability, if any. Certain pending loss contingencies are described in Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, of individual matters or groups of related matters not specifically described in Note 18 is not expected to be material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The following describes our methods and associated processes for evaluating these matters.\n \n\n\nBecause of the complex environment in which we operate, we are subject to numerous legal proceedings and claims, including those relating to general commercial matters, governmental enforcement actions, employment-related claims, vehicle accidents, and FedEx Ground\u2019s service providers. Accounting guidance for contingencies requires an accrual of estimated loss from a contingency, such as a non-income tax or other legal proceeding or claim, when it is probable (i.e., the future event or events are likely to occur) that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. This guidance also requires disclosure of a loss contingency matter when, in management\u2019s judgment, a material loss is reasonably possible or probable.\n \n\n\nDuring the preparation of our financial statements, we evaluate our contingencies to determine whether it is probable, reasonably possible, or remote that a liability has been incurred. A loss is recognized for all contingencies deemed probable and estimable, regardless of amount. For unresolved contingencies with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible, we evaluate whether a potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.\n\n\nOur evaluation of these matters is the result of a comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of a loss or disclosure of these contingencies is made in a timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel, as well as external counsel where applicable. The process includes regular communications during each quarter and scheduled meetings shortly before the completion of our financial statements to evaluate any new legal proceedings and the status of existing matters.\n\n\nIn determining whether a loss should be accrued or a loss contingency disclosed, we evaluate, among other factors:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nthe current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit or proceeding (e.g., the lengthy and complex nature of class-action matters); \n\n\n\u2022\nthe procedural status of each matter; \n\n\n\u2022\nany opportunities to dispose of a lawsuit on its merits before trial (i.e., motion to dismiss or for summary judgment); \n\n\n\u2022\nthe amount of time remaining before a trial date; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe status of discovery; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe status of settlement, arbitration, or mediation proceedings; and \n\n\n\u2022\nour judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial. \n\n\n- \n70\n -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn reaching our conclusions with respect to accrual of a loss or loss contingency disclosure, we take a holistic view of each matter based on these factors and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements. Uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factors may impact our decisions related to accrual or disclosure of a loss contingency, including a conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or a meaningful range of possible loss. We update our disclosures to reflect our most current understanding of the contingencies at the time we issue our financial statements. However, events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss.\n \n\n\nDespite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingencies, we believe that our processes are robust and thorough and provide a consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingencies for proper accounting recognition and disclosure.\n \n\n",
    "item7a": ">ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI\nVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n \n\n\nINTEREST RATES. \nWhile we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates, we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on our long-term debt. As disclosed in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had outstanding fixed-rate long-term debt (exclusive of finance leases) with an estimated fair value of $17.5 billion at May 31, 2023 and outstanding fixed-rate long-term debt (exclusive of finance leases) with an estimated fair value of $18.8 billion at May 31, 2022. Market risk for long-term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately $743 million as of May 31, 2023 and approximately $518 million as of May 31, 2022. The underlying fair values of our long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities.\n \n\n\nWe have interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations. Changes in interest rates impact our liabilities associated with these retirement plans, as well as the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized. Declines in the value of plan assets could diminish the funded status of our pension plans and potentially increase our requirement to make contributions to the plans. Substantial investment losses on plan assets would also increase net pension expense. See the \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates \u2014 Retirement Plans\u201d section of \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report for more information.\n\n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY.\n While we are a global provider of transportation, e-commerce, and business services, the majority of our transactions during the periods presented in this Annual Report are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the euro, Chinese yuan, British pound, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, and Mexican peso. Historically, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is more significant with respect to our revenue than our expenses, as a significant portion of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, such as aircraft and fuel expenses. Foreign currency fluctuations had a slightly negative impact on operating income in 2023 and a slightly positive impact on operating income in 2022. However, favorable foreign currency fluctuations also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained or the demand for our services, which is not quantifiable. At May 31, 2023, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in expected operating income of approximately $236 million for 2024. This theoretical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar, which is not consistent with our actual experience in foreign currency transactions. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors\u2019 services become more or less attractive. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.\n \n\n\nWe maintain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuations related to probable future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than the currency of the transacting entity which impacts our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. These derivatives are not designated as hedges and are accounted for at fair value with any profit or loss recorded in income, which was immaterial for 2023 and 2022.\n \n\n\nCOMMODITY.\n While we have market risk for changes in the price of jet and vehicle fuel, this risk is largely mitigated by our indexed fuel surcharges. For additional discussion of our indexed fuel surcharges, see the \u201cResults of Operations and Outlook \u2014 Consolidated Results \u2014 Fuel\u201d section of \u201cItem 7.
