We expect to continue to grow our sales headcount to expand our reach in all key growth sectors.\nOur sales organization is supported by sales engineers with responsibility for pre-sales technical support, solutions engineering for our end-customers, and technical training for our channel partners.\nChannel Program.\n \nOur NextWave Channel Partner program is focused on building in-depth relationships with solutions-oriented distributors and resellers that have strong security expertise. The program rewards these partners based on a number of attainment goals, as well as provides them access to marketing funds, technical and sales training, and support. To promote optimal productivity, we operate a formal accreditation program for our channel partners\u2019 sales and technical professionals. As of July\u00a031, 2023, we had more than 7,100 channel partners.\nGlobal Customer Success.\n Our Global Customer Success (\u201cGCS\u201d) organization is responsible for delivering professional, educational, and support services directly to our channel partners and end-customers. We leverage the capabilities of our channel partners and train them in the delivery of professional, educational, and support services to enable these services to be locally delivered. We believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products, and we have hired support engineers with proven experience to provide those services.\n- 10 \n-\nTable of Contents\nMarketing.\n Our marketing is focused on building our brand reputation and the market awareness of our portfolio and driving pipeline and end-customer demand. Our marketing team consists primarily of product marketing, brand, demand generation, field marketing, digital marketing, communications, analyst relations, and marketing analytics functions. Marketing activities include pipeline development through demand generation, social media and advertising programs, managing the corporate website and partner portal, trade shows and conferences, analyst relationships, customer advocacy, and customer awareness. Every year we organize multiple signature events, such as our end-customer conference \u201cIgnite\u201d and focused conferences such as \u201cCortex Symphony\u201d and \u201cSASE Converge.\u201d We also publish threat intelligence research, such as the Unit\u00a042 Cloud Threat Report and the Unit\u00a042 Network Threat Trends Research Report, which are based on data from our global threat intelligence team, Unit\u00a042. These activities and tools benefit both our direct and indirect channels and are available at no cost to our channel partners.\nBacklog.\n \nOrders for subscription and support offerings for multiple years are generally billed upfront upon fulfillment and are included in deferred revenue. Contract amounts that are not recorded in deferred revenue or revenue are considered backlog. We expect backlog related to subscription and support offerings will change from period to period for various reasons, including the timing and duration of customer orders and varying billing cycles of those orders. Products are billed upon hardware shipment or delivery of software license. The majority of our product revenue comes from orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter. However, insufficient supply and inventory may delay our hardware product shipments. As such, we do not believe that our product backlog at any particular time is necessarily indicative of our future operating results.\nSeasonality.\n \nOur business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns. We have begun to see seasonal patterns in our business, which we expect to become more pronounced as we continue to grow, with our strongest sequential revenue growth generally occurring in our fiscal second and fourth quarters.\nMANUFACTURING\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to various manufacturing partners, which include our electronics manufacturing services provider (\u201cEMS provider\u201d) and original design manufacturers. This approach allows us to reduce our costs as it reduces our manufacturing overhead and inventory and also allows us to adjust more quickly to changing end-customer demand. Our EMS provider is Flextronics International,\u00a0Ltd. (\u201cFlex\u201d), who assembles our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions.\nThe component parts within our products are either sourced by our manufacturing partners or by us from various component suppliers. Our manufacturing and supply contracts, generally, do not guarantee a certain level of supply or fixed pricing, which increases our exposure to supply shortages or price increases.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nWe believe our ongoing success depends on our employees. Development and investment in our people is central to who we are, and will continue to be so. With a global workforce of 13,948 as of July\u00a031, 2023, our People Strategy is a critical element of our overall company strategy. Our People Strategy is a comprehensive approach to source, hire, onboard, develop, engage, and reward employees. Our approach is grounded on core tenants: respect each employee as an individual, demonstrate fairness and equity in all we do, facilitate flexibility, personalization, and choice whenever possible, and nurture a culture where employees are supported in doing the best work of their careers. Our values of disruption, execution, collaboration, inclusion, and integrity were co-created with employees and serve as the foundation of our culture.\nSource & Hire.\n \nSourcing diverse talent who possess the skills and capabilities to execute and add value to our culture form the cornerstone of our comprehensive approach to talent acquisition\u2014a philosophy we call \u201cThe Way We Hire.\u201d We utilize an array of methods to identify subject matter experts in their respective fields, emphasizing sourcing channels that connect us with underrepresented talents.\nIn an effort to foster career growth within Palo Alto Networks, we prioritize internal mobility. This allows current employees to progress either through a traditional career path or by exploring roles across various business functions, often culminating in promotions. We encourage existing employees to refer qualified individuals for our open positions, thus leveraging the collective networks of our team to attract a diverse range of expertise and perspectives.\nWe have made strides to understand job requirements and implement structured interviewing practices to identify candidates of the highest quality. By conducting thorough job analyses and creating success profiles, we have developed a deeper understanding of what is required for success in critical roles. We equip our hiring managers with essential training to identify and mitigate potential unconscious biases. Our interviewing process emphasizes values and competencies that we believe enhance our culture. This commitment extends to conducting interviews with diverse panelists and providing a balanced evaluation and quality interview experience for a diverse slate of candidates. We remain steadfast in our commitment to fairness, bias reduction, and equal opportunities for all potential hires.\n- 11 \n-\nTable of Contents\nA key to our hiring process is the Global Hiring Committees, introduced in fiscal 2023. These committees play a significant role in elevating our hiring standards by promoting shared understanding, reducing biases, enhancing objectivity, and ensuring the recruitment of diverse talent. The Committees foster effective collaboration using a common language and consensus-driven decision-making.\nOnboard & Develop.\n \nWe believe that each member of our workforce is unique, and that their integration into Palo Alto Networks and their career journey involve unique needs, interests, and goals. That is why our development programs are grounded on individualization, flexibility, and choice. From onboarding to ongoing development, our FLEXLearn philosophy offers multiple paths to assess, develop, and grow.\nOur onboarding experience starts with \u201cpre-boarding.\u201d Before an employee\u2019s start date, they are provided access to foundational tools to help them prepare to join Palo Alto Networks. We view pre-boarding as fundamental to introducing new employees to our culture, building trust, and facilitating rapid productivity. Welcome Day is a combination of in-person, virtual learning platforms and communication channels that provide new employees with inspirational, often personalized, onboarding experiences that carry on through the first year of employment. We have specialized learning tracks for interns and new graduates that have been recognized as best in class externally to support early-in-career individuals in acclimating to our culture as they progress on their career journey. As part of our merger and acquisition strategy, we have also established a robust integration program with the goal to enable individuals joining our teams to feel part of our culture at speed.\nFollowing onboarding, there are a variety of ways that employees can assess their interests and skills, build a development plan specific to those insights, and continue to grow. Our development initiatives are delivered to employees through a comprehensive platform, FLEXLearn. The platform contains curated content and programs, such as assessment instruments, thousands of courses, workshops, and mentoring and coaching services. Leaders and executives also have access to specialized learning tracks that help them strategize, mobilize, and deliver maximum personal and team performance. Employees have full agency to direct their growth at their pace and choosing. Development information about core business elements, working in a distributed hybrid environment, as well as required company-wide compliance training, such as Code of Conduct, privacy and security, anti-discrimination, anti-harassment, and anti-bribery training, is also deployed through the FLEXLearn platform for all employees. In addition, FLEXLearn provides employees with events and activities that motivate and spark critical thinking, on topics ranging from inclusion to well-being and collaboration. On average, employees had completed 33\u00a0hours of development through the FLEXLearn platform during fiscal 2023.\nEngage & Reward.\n \nWe aim to foster engagement through a multifaceted approach to collect, understand, and act on employee feedback. Our comprehensive communication and listening strategy utilizes in-person and technology-enabled channels. We share and collect information through corporate and functional \u201cAll Hands\u201d meetings, including several meetings specifically focused on employee-centered topics in an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d format. Digital Displays across our sites, our intranet platform, monthly and weekly email communications, and an active Slack platform provide a regular flow of information to and between employees and leadership. In addition to these channels that reach large audiences, we conduct regular executive listening sessions, including small group convenings with our CEO and other C-suite leaders, and ad-hoc pulse surveys to better understand employee engagement, sentiment, well-being, and the ability to transition to a hybrid work model.\nEmployee sentiment is also collected from external sources, such as web platforms that crowdsource feedback. Employees provide commentary to platforms such as Glassdoor, Comparably, and others and insights from those platforms are used to measure engagement. In addition, based on employee participation in an anonymous survey, the Best Practice Institute has certified Palo Alto Networks as a \u201cmost loved workplace\u201d (2021, 2022, and 2023). Palo Alto Networks has been recognized by Glassdoor, Comparably, Human Rights Campaign, Disability Index, and others as an employer of choice. Our CEO has also earned a 92% employee approval rating on Glassdoor, a top percentile score.\nIn addition to a comprehensive compensation and diverse benefits program, we believe in an always-on feedback and rewards philosophy. From recurring 1:1\u00a0sessions, quarterly performance feedback, semi-annual performance reviews to use of our Cheers for Peers peer recognition program, employees get continuous input about the value they bring to the organization.\nThese engagement and recognition strategies have informed our holistic People Strategy, including our Inclusion and Diversity (\u201cI&D\u201d) initiatives and Internal Mobility program. Based on the outcomes from external sources, insights from internal sources, our modest attrition rate (compared to market trends), and strong participation in our Internal Mobility program, we believe employees at Palo Alto Networks feel engaged and rewarded.\nInclusion & Diversity.\n We are intentional about including diverse points of view, perspectives, experiences, backgrounds, and ideas in our decision-making processes. We deeply believe that true diversity exists when we have representation of all ethnicities, genders, orientations and identities, and cultures in our workforce. Our corporate I&D programs focus on five principles\u2014our workforce should feel psychologically safe, they should understand, listen, and support one another, and they should elevate others. These principles are the foundation of our approach to I&D, which we call P.U.L.S.E.\n- 12 \n-\nTable of Contents\nWe have eleven employee network groups (\u201cENG\u201ds) that play a vital role in building understanding and awareness. Over 29% of our global workforce was involved in at least one ENG as of July\u00a031, 2023. ENGs are also allocated funding to make charitable grants to organizations advancing their causes. We involve our ENGs in listening sessions with executive teams and we work in partnership to develop our annual I&D plans because we believe involvement is\u00a0critical.\nOur I&D philosophy is fully embedded in our talent acquisition, learning and development, performance elevation, and rewards and recognition programs. The diversity of our board of directors, with women representing 40% of our board as of July\u00a031, 2023, is an example of our commitment to inclusion and diversity.\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE\nWe recognize our duty to address environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices. From our science-based approach to emissions reductions and our social impact programs to our Supplier Responsibility initiatives and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we value the opportunity to have meaningful outcomes that reinforce our intention to respect our planet, uplift our communities, and advance our industry.\nEnvironmental.\n We recognize climate change is a global crisis and are committed to doing our part to reduce environmental impacts. We remain committed to our goals of utilizing 100% renewable energy by 2030, reducing our greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions and working across our value chain, and with coalitions, to address climate change. We made progress towards our goals in fiscal 2023 through several milestones. We engaged with a local utility provider to power our Santa Clara, California headquarters with 100% renewable energy effective January\u00a01, 2023. Our near-term scope 1, 2, and 3\u00a0emissions reduction goals, aligned to a warming scenario of 1.5\u00b0\u00a0Celsius, were verified by the Science Based Targets initiative. We were recognized by Carbon Disclosure Project (\u201cCDP\u201d) as an \u201cA-List\u201d company and a \u201cSupplier Engagement Leader.\u201d We remain committed to being transparent about our progress over time through annual reporting.\nSocial.\n In addition to our People Strategy described in the section titled \u201cHuman Capital\u201d above, we prioritized the health and safety of our global workforce. Through the deployment of our Global Supplier Code of Conduct, we continued to reach across our supply chain to communicate our expectations regarding labor standards, business practices, and workplace health and safety conditions. During fiscal 2023, we maintained our affiliate membership in the Responsible Business Alliance and maintained our commitment to Supplier Diversity. We value our role as a good corporate citizen and in fiscal 2023 continued to execute our social impact programs. We made charitable grants to support organizations providing services in our core funding areas of education, including academic scholarships, diversity, and basic needs. We expanded our work to provide cybersecurity curriculum to schools, universities, and nonprofit organizations to help individuals of all ages protect their digital way of life and to prepare diverse adults for careers in cybersecurity. Employees continued to participate in our giving, matching, and volunteer programs to make impacts in their local communities.\nGovernance. \nIntegrity is one of our core values. Our corporate behavior and leadership practices model ethical decision-making. All employees are informed about our governance expectations through our Codes of Conduct, compliance training programs, and ongoing communications. Our board of directors is governed by Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are amended from time to time to incorporate best practices in corporate governance. Reinforcing the importance of our ESG performance, the charter of the ESG and Nominating Committee of the board of directors includes the primary oversight of ESG.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nOur website is located at www.paloaltonetworks.com, and our investor relations website is located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com.

    "item1a": ">Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks or others not specified below materialize, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, the impacts of any worsening of the economic environment may exacerbate the risks described below, any of which could have a material impact on us. \nRisk Factor Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment.\n\u2022\nOur business and operations have experienced growth in recent periods, and if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results could be adversely\u00a0affected.\n\u2022\nOur revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance, and we may not be able to maintain profitability, which could cause our business, financial condition, and operating results to suffer.\n\u2022\nOur operating results may vary significantly from period to period, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations, and such results may not be indicative of future performance.\n\u2022\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to sell new and additional product, subscription, and support offerings to our end-customers, especially to large enterprise customers, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.\n\u2022\nWe rely on revenue from subscription and support offerings, and because we recognize revenue from subscription and support over the term of the relevant service period, downturns or upturns in sales or renewals of these subscription and support offerings are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.\n\u2022\nThe sales prices of our products, subscriptions, and support offerings may decrease, which may reduce our revenue and gross profits and adversely impact our financial results.\n\u2022\nWe rely on our channel partners to sell substantially all of our products, including subscriptions and support, and if these channel partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products and subscriptions will be limited and our operating results will be harmed.\n\u2022\nWe are exposed to the credit and liquidity risk of our customers, and to credit exposure in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.\n\u2022\nA portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.\n\u2022\nWe face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\n\u2022\nWe may acquire other businesses, which could subject us to adverse claims or liabilities, require significant management attention, disrupt our business, adversely affect our operating results, may not result in the expected benefits of such acquisitions, and may dilute stockholder value.\n\u2022\nIf we do not accurately predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological and market developments and successfully manage product and subscription introductions and transitions to meet changing end-customer needs in the enterprise security industry, our competitive position and prospects will be harmed.\n\u2022\nIssues in the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) may result in reputational harm and legal liability and could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\u2022\nA network or data security incident may allow unauthorized access to our network or data, harm our reputation, create additional liability, and adversely impact our financial results.\n\u2022\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our products, subscriptions, or support offerings, the failure of our products or subscriptions to block a virus or prevent a security breach or incident, misuse of our products, or risks of product liability claims could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operating results.\n\u2022\nOur ability to sell our products and subscriptions is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and those of our channel partners, and the failure to offer high-quality technical support services could have a material adverse effect on our end-customers\u2019 satisfaction with our products and subscriptions, our sales, and our operating\u00a0results.\n\u2022\nClaims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business.\n- 14 \n-\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nOur proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce or protect, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products or subscriptions without compensating us.\n\u2022\nOur use of open source software in our products and subscriptions could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subscriptions and subject us to possible litigation.\n\u2022\nWe license technology from third parties, and our inability to maintain those licenses could harm our business.\n\u2022\nBecause we depend on manufacturing partners to build and ship our hardware products, we are susceptible to manufacturing and logistics delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time, if at all, or on a cost-effective basis, which may result in the loss of sales and end-customers.\n\u2022\nManaging the supply of our hardware products and product components is complex. Insufficient supply and inventory would result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory would harm our gross\u00a0margins.\n\u2022\nBecause some of the key components in our hardware products come from limited sources of supply, we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes, which, in certain cases, have disrupted or delayed our scheduled product deliveries to our end-customers, increased our costs and may result in the loss of sales and end-customers.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to attract, retain, and motivate our key technical, sales, and management personnel, our business could suffer.\n\u2022\nWe generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to distributors, resellers, and end-customers outside of the United States, and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations.\n\u2022\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022\nWe face risks associated with having operations and employees located in Israel.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\n\u2022\nOur actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could have a material adverse effect on our\u00a0business.\n\u2022\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\n\u2022\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nWe are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or our internal control may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\n\u2022\nOur reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters and/or our reporting of such matters.\n\u2022\nFailure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business.\n\u2022\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our Notes, repurchase our Notes upon a fundamental change, or repay our Notes in cash at their maturity, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of our Notes.\n\u2022\nWe may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions that would diminish our ability to make payments on our Notes when due.\n\u2022\nThe market price of our common stock historically has been volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock could decline.\n\u2022\nThe convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of our common stock.\n\u2022\nThe issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans, the conversion of our Notes or exercise of the related Warrants, or otherwise will dilute stock held by all other stockholders.\n\u2022\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance shareholder value, and share repurchases could affect the price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\n\u2022\nOur charter documents and Delaware law, as well as certain provisions contained in the indentures governing our Notes, could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment, which could also reduce the market price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, health risks, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems, such as terrorism.\n\u2022\nOur failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products and subscriptions could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.\n- 15 \n-\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Global Economic and Geopolitical Conditions\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment.\nWe operate globally, and as a result, our business and revenues are impacted by global economic and geopolitical conditions. The instability in the global credit markets, inflation, changes in public policies such as domestic and international regulations, taxes, any increases in interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, or international trade agreements, international trade disputes, geopolitical turmoil, and other disruptions to global and regional economies and markets continue to add uncertainty to global economic conditions. Military actions or armed conflict, including Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and any related political or economic responses and counter-responses, and uncertainty about, or changes in, government and trade relationships, policies, and treaties could also lead to worsening economic and market conditions and geopolitical environment. In response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the United States, along with the European Union, has imposed restrictive sanctions on Russia, Russian entities, and Russian citizens (\u201cSanctions on Russia\u201d). We are subject to these governmental sanctions and export controls, which may subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. Any continued or further uncertainty, weakness or deterioration in economic and market conditions or the geopolitical environment could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including reductions in sales of our products and subscriptions, longer sales cycles, reductions in subscription or contract duration and value, slower adoption of new technologies, alterations in the spending patterns or priorities of current and prospective customers (including delaying purchasing decisions), increased costs for the chips and components to manufacture our products, and increased price competition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR GROWTH\nOur business and operations have experienced growth in recent periods, and if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results could be adversely\u00a0affected.\nWe have experienced growth and increased demand for our products and subscriptions over the last few years. As a result, our employee headcount has increased, and we expect it to continue to grow over the next year. For example, from the end of fiscal 2022 to the end of fiscal 2023, our headcount increased from 12,561 to 13,948\u00a0employees. In addition, as we have grown, the number of end-customers has also increased, and we have managed more complex deployments of our products and subscriptions with larger end-customers. The growth and expansion of our business and product, subscription, and support offerings places a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement, scale, or manage improvements to our systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner, which could result in material disruptions of our operations and business. In addition, our existing systems, processes, and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud. We may also experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls, or in connection with third-party software licensed to help us with such improvements. Any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization. Failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, disrupt our existing end-customer relationships, reduce demand for or limit us to smaller deployments of our products, or materially harm our business performance and operating results. \nOur revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance, and we may not be able to maintain profitability, which could cause our business, financial condition, and operating results to suffer.\nWe have experienced revenue growth rates of 25.3% and 29.3% in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Our revenue for any quarterly or annual period should not be relied upon as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth for any future period. If we are unable to maintain consistent or increasing revenue or revenue growth, the market price of our common stock could be volatile, and it may be difficult for us to maintain profitability or maintain or increase cash flow on a consistent basis. \n- 16 \n-\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, we have incurred losses in fiscal years prior to fiscal 2023 and, as a result, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.2\u00a0billion as of July\u00a031, 2023. We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to grow our business. Our growth efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues sufficiently, or at all, to offset increasing expenses. Revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons, including slowing demand for our products or subscriptions, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of, or a demand shift in, our overall market, or a failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. We have also entered into a substantial amount of capital commitments for operating lease obligations and other purchase commitments. Any failure to increase our revenue as we grow our business could prevent us from maintaining profitability or maintaining or increasing cash flow on a consistent basis, or satisfying our capital commitments. If we are unable to navigate these challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition, and operating results may suffer.\nOur operating results may vary significantly from period to period, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations, and such results may not be indicative of future performance.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past, and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future, as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including those factors described in this Risk Factor section. For example, we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter. If expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason, including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize (particularly for large enterprise end-customers with lengthy sales cycles), our logistics partners\u2019 inability to ship products prior to fiscal quarter-end to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of a fiscal quarter, our failure to manage inventory to meet demand, any failure of our systems related to order review and processing, or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements (including new compliance requirements imposed by new or renegotiated trade agreements), our revenue could fall below our expectations and the estimates of analysts for that quarter. Due to these fluctuations, comparing our revenue, margins, or other operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. \nThis variability and unpredictability could also result in our failure to meet our revenue, margin, or other operating result expectations contained in any forward-looking statements (including financial or business expectations we have provided) or those of securities analysts or investors for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these, or any other, reasons, the market price of our common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue.\nWe believe there are significant seasonal factors that may cause our second and fourth fiscal quarters to record greater revenue sequentially than our first and third fiscal quarters. We believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nend-customers with a December 31 fiscal year-end choosing to spend remaining unused portions of their discretionary budgets before their fiscal year-end, which potentially results in a positive impact on our revenue in our second fiscal quarter;\n\u2022\nour sales compensation plans, which are typically structured around annual quotas and commission rate accelerators, which potentially results in a positive impact on our revenue in our fourth fiscal quarter; and\n\u2022\nthe timing of end-customer budget planning at the beginning of the calendar year, which can result in a delay in spending at the beginning of the calendar year, potentially resulting in a negative impact on our revenue in our third fiscal quarter.\nAs we continue to grow, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced, and our business, operating results, and financial position may be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY\nIf we are unable to sell new and additional product, subscription, and support offerings to our end-customers, especially to large enterprise customers, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the deployment of our portfolio with existing end-customers, especially large enterprise customers, and create demand for our new offerings, The rate at which our end-customers purchase additional products, subscriptions, and support depends on a number of factors, including the perceived need for additional security products, including subscription and support offerings, as well as general economic conditions. If our efforts to sell additional products and subscriptions to our end-customers are not successful, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected or\u00a0decline.\n- 17 \n-\nTable of Contents\nSales to large enterprise end-customers, which is part of our growth strategy, involve risks that may not be present, or that are present to a lesser extent, with sales to smaller entities, such as (a) longer sales cycles and the associated risk that substantial time and resources may be spent on a potential end-customer that elects not to purchase our products, subscriptions, and support, and (b) increased purchasing power and leverage held by large end-customers in negotiating contractual arrangements. Deployments for large enterprise end-customers are also more complex, require greater product functionality, scalability, and a broader range of services, and are more time-consuming. All of\u00a0these factors add further risk to business conducted with these end-customers. Failure to realize sales from large enterprise end-customers could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial\u00a0condition.\nWe rely on revenue from subscription and support offerings, and because we recognize revenue from subscription and support over the term of the relevant service period, downturns or upturns in sales or renewals of these subscription and support offerings are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.\nSubscription and support revenue accounts for a significant portion of our revenue, comprising 77.1% of total revenue in fiscal 2023, 75.2% of total revenue in fiscal 2022, and 73.7% of total revenue in fiscal 2021. Sales and renewals of subscription and support contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including end-customers\u2019 level of satisfaction with our products and subscriptions, the frequency and severity of subscription outages, our product uptime or latency, the prices of our products and subscriptions, and reductions in our end-customers\u2019 spending levels. Existing end-customers have no contractual obligation to, and may not, renew their subscription and support contracts after the completion of their initial contract period. Additionally, our end-customers may renew their subscription and support agreements for shorter contract lengths or on other terms that are less economically beneficial to us. If our sales of new or renewal subscription and support contracts decline, our total revenue and revenue growth rate may decline, and our business will suffer. In addition, because we recognize subscription and support revenue over the term of the relevant service period, which is typically one to five years, a decline in subscription or support contracts in any one fiscal quarter will not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue in that fiscal quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters.\nThe sales prices of our products, subscriptions, and support offerings may decrease, which may reduce our revenue and gross profits and adversely impact our financial results.\nThe sales prices for our products, subscriptions, and support offerings may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, a change in our mix of products, subscriptions, and support offerings, anticipation of the introduction of new products, subscriptions, or support offerings, or promotional programs or pricing pressures. Furthermore, we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products could decrease over product life cycles. Declining sales prices could adversely affect our revenue, gross profits, and profitability.\nWe rely on our channel partners to sell substantially all of our products, including subscriptions and support, and if these channel partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products and subscriptions will be limited and our operating results will be harmed.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is generated by sales through our channel partners, including distributors and resellers. For fiscal 2023, three distributors individually represented 10% or more of our total revenue and in the aggregate represented 49.7% of our total revenue. As of July\u00a031, 2023, two distributors individually represented 10% or more of our gross accounts receivable and in the aggregate represented 37.6% of our gross accounts receivable.\nWe provide our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our products, including subscriptions and support offerings, but there can be no assurance that these steps will be utilized or effective. In addition, our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing, selling, and supporting our products and subscriptions. We may not be able to incentivize these channel partners to sell our products and subscriptions to end-customers and, in particular, to large enterprises. These channel partners may also have incentives to promote our competitors\u2019 products and may devote more resources to the marketing, sales, and support of competitive products. Our agreements with our channel partners may generally be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice prior to each annual renewal date. We cannot be certain that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement channel partners. In addition, any new channel partner requires extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity. Our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability, and reputational harm if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or subscriptions to end-customers or violate laws or our corporate policies. If we fail to effectively manage our sales channels or channel partners, our ability to sell our products and subscriptions and operating results will be harmed.\n- 18 \n-\nTable of Contents\nWe are exposed to the credit and liquidity risk of our customers, and to credit exposure in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.\nMost of our sales are made on an open credit basis. Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and deferred payments due to, among other things, macro-economic conditions. To respond to this demand, our customer financing activities have increased and will likely continue to increase in the future. Increases in deferred payments result in payments being made over time, negatively impacting our short-term cash flows, and subject us to risk of non-payment by our customers, including as a result of insolvency. We monitor customer payment capability in granting such financing arrangements, seek to limit the amounts to what we believe customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts to mitigate credit risks of these customers. However, there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks. To the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers\u2019 ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur exposure to the credit risks relating to the financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty. If we are unable to adequately control these risks, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, in the past, we have experienced non-material losses due to bankruptcies among customers. If these losses increase due to global economic conditions, they could harm our business and financial condition.\nA portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.\nSales to government entities are subject to a number of risks. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. The substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners. Government certification requirements for products and subscriptions like ours may change, thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification. If our products and subscriptions are late in achieving or fail to achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, or our competitors achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, we may be disqualified from selling our products, subscriptions, and support offerings to such governmental entity, or be at a competitive disadvantage, which would harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Government demand and payment for our products, subscriptions, and support offerings may be impacted by government shutdowns, public sector budgetary cycles, contracting requirements, and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products, subscriptions, and support offerings. Government entities may have statutory, contractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results. Governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors\u2019 administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products, subscriptions, and support offerings, a reduction of revenue, or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, which could adversely impact our operating results in a material way. Additionally, the U.S. government may require certain of the products that it purchases to be manufactured in the United States and other relatively high-cost manufacturing locations, and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet such requirements, affecting our ability to sell these products, subscriptions, and support offerings to the U.S. government.\nWe face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\nThe industry for enterprise security products is intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants. Our main competitors fall into four categories:\n\u2022\nlarge companies that incorporate security features in their products, such as Cisco, Microsoft, or those that have acquired, or may acquire, security vendors and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market;\n\u2022\nindependent security vendors, such as Check Point, Fortinet, Crowdstrike, and Zscaler, that offer a mix of security products;\n\u2022\nstartups and point-product vendors that offer independent or emerging solutions across various areas of security; and\n\u2022\npublic cloud vendors and startups that offer solutions for cloud security (private, public, and hybrid cloud).\n- 19 \n-\nTable of Contents\nMany of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, and other resources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and a larger base of customers than we do. They may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of products and services than we can, and they may offer lower pricing than we do. Further, they may have greater resources for research and development of new technologies, the provision of customer support, and the pursuit of acquisitions. They may also have larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios, and broader and more diverse product and service offerings, which allow them to leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products and subscriptions, including incorporating cybersecurity features into their existing products or services and product bundling, selling at zero or negative margins, and offering concessions or a closed technology offering. Some competitors may have broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and end-customers. Other competitors specialize in providing protection from a single type of security threat, which may allow them to deliver these specialized security products to the market more quickly than we can.\nWe also face competition from companies that have entrenched legacy offerings at end-user customers. End-user customers have also often invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking and security products. As a result, these organizations may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than add or switch to a new supplier such as us. In addition, as our customers refresh the security products bought in prior years, they may seek to consolidate vendors, which may result in current customers choosing to purchase products from our competitors. Due to budget constraints or economic downturns, organizations may add solutions to their existing network security infrastructure rather than replacing it with our products and subscriptions.\nConditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnering or acquisitions by our competitors, or continuing market consolidation. Our competitors and potential competitors may be able to develop new or disruptive technologies, products, or services, and leverage new business models that are equal or superior to ours, achieve greater market acceptance of their products and services, disrupt our markets, and increase sales by utilizing different distribution channels than we do. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including AI and machine learning, continue to increase our competition. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant, and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner. Some of our competitors have made or could make acquisitions of businesses that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive solutions than they had previously offered and adapt more quickly to new technologies and end-customer needs. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources. \nThese competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins, and loss of market share. If we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take aggressive pricing or other actions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe may acquire other businesses, which could subject us to adverse claims or liabilities, require significant management attention, disrupt our business, adversely affect our operating results, may not result in the expected benefits of such acquisitions, and may dilute stockholder value.\nAs part of our business strategy, we acquire and make investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates is difficult, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, we may be subject to claims or liabilities assumed from an acquired company, product, or technology; acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end-customers, investors, and securities analysts; and we may incur costs and expenses necessary to address an acquired company\u2019s failure to comply with laws and governmental rules and regulations. Additionally, we may be subject to litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our business faces. \nIf we are unsuccessful at integrating past or future acquisitions in a timely manner, or the technologies and operations associated with such acquisitions, into our company, our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, which may disrupt our ongoing business and divert management\u2019s attention, and we may not be able to manage the integration process successfully or in a timely manner. We may have difficulty retaining key personnel of the acquired business. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, realize anticipated synergies from the acquisition, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction and integration of such acquisition, including accounting charges and any potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets recognized in connection with such acquisitions. In addition, any acquisitions may be viewed negatively by our customers, financial markets, or investors and may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and business strategy.\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity or equity-linked securities to pay for any future acquisitions, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, the sale of equity or issuance of equity-linked debt to finance any future acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n- 20 \n-\nTable of Contents\nIf we do not accurately predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological and market developments and successfully manage product and subscription introductions and transitions to meet changing end-customer needs in the enterprise security industry, our competitive position and prospects will be harmed.\nThe enterprise security industry has grown quickly and continues to evolve rapidly. Moreover, many of our end-customers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans, which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex enterprise networks, incorporating a variety of hardware, software applications, operating systems, and networking protocols. If we fail to effectively anticipate, identify, and respond to rapidly evolving technological and market developments in a timely manner, our business will be harmed. \nIn order to anticipate and respond effectively to rapid technological changes and market developments, as well as evolving security threats, we must invest effectively in research and development to increase the reliability, availability, and scalability of our existing products and subscriptions and introduce new products and subscriptions. Our investments in research and development, including investments in AI, may not result in design or performance improvements, marketable products, subscriptions, or features, or may not achieve the cost savings or additional revenue that we expect. In addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, require significant investment and raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we must continually change our products and expand our business strategy in response to changes in network infrastructure requirements, including the expanding use of cloud computing. For example, organizations are moving portions of their data to be managed by third parties, primarily infrastructure, platform, and application service providers, and may rely on such providers\u2019 internal security measures. While we have historically been successful in developing, acquiring, and marketing new products and product enhancements that respond to technological change and evolving industry standards, we may not be able to continue to do so, and there can be no assurance that our new or future offerings will be successful or will achieve widespread market acceptance. If we fail to accurately predict and address end-customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends in the enterprise security industry, including in the areas of AI, mobility, virtualization, cloud computing, and software-defined networks, our business could be harmed. \nThe technology in our portfolio is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, while minimizing the impact on network performance. Additionally, some of our new features and related enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures that involve complex, expensive, and time-consuming research and development processes. The development of our portfolio is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain as there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new features. If we experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products, features, and subscriptions, and fail to meet customer expectations for such availability, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed. \nThe success of new features depends on several factors, including appropriate new product definition, differentiation of new products, subscriptions, and features from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products, services, and features. Moreover, successful new product introduction and transition depends on a number of factors, including our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies, especially in the early stages of introduction. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify opportunities for new products and subscriptions, develop and bring new products and subscriptions to market in a timely manner, achieve market acceptance of our products and subscriptions, or that products, subscriptions, and technologies developed by others will not render our products, subscriptions, and technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nIssues in the development and deployment of AI may result in reputational harm and legal liability and could adversely affect our results of operations. \nWe have incorporated, and are continuing to develop and deploy, AI into many of our products and solutions, including services that support our products and solutions. AI presents challenges and risks that could affect our products and solutions, and therefore our business. For example, AI algorithms may have flaws, and datasets used to train models may be insufficient or contain biased information. These potential issues could subject us to regulatory risk, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the EU and regulations being considered in other jurisdictions, and brand or reputational harm.\nThe rapid evolution of AI, including potential government regulation of AI, requires us to invest significant resources to develop, test, and maintain AI in our products and services in a manner that meets evolving requirements and expectations. The rules and regulations adopted by policymakers over time may require us to make changes to our business practices. Developing, testing, and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost profile of our offerings due to the nature of the computing costs involved in such systems.\n- 21 \n-\nTable of Contents\nThe intellectual property ownership and license rights surrounding AI technologies, as well as data protection laws related to the use and development of AI, are currently not fully addressed by courts or regulators. The use or adoption of AI technologies in our products may result in exposure to claims by third parties of copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation, which may require us to pay compensation or license fees to third parties. The evolving legal, regulatory, and compliance framework for AI technologies may also impact our ability to protect our own data and intellectual property against infringing use.\nA network or data security incident may allow unauthorized access to our network or data, harm our reputation, create additional liability, and adversely impact our financial results.\nIncreasingly, companies are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis. In addition to traditional computer \u201chackers,\u201d malicious code (such as viruses and worms), phishing attempts, employee theft or misuse, and denial of service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors engage in intrusions and attacks (including advanced persistent threat intrusions and supply chain attacks), and add to the risks to our internal networks, cloud-deployed enterprise and customer-facing environments and the information they store and process. Incidences of cyberattacks and other cybersecurity breaches and incidents have increased and are likely to continue to increase. We and our third-party service providers face security threats and attacks from a variety of sources. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches of our internal networks, systems, and websites, our data, corporate systems, and security measures, as well as those of our third-party service providers, are still vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, or other types of attacks from outside parties, or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance, or some combination of these. We cannot guarantee that the measures we have taken to protect our networks, systems, and websites will provide adequate security. Furthermore, as a well-known provider of security solutions, we may be a more attractive target for such attacks. The conflict in Ukraine and associated activities in Ukraine and Russia may increase the risk of cyberattacks on various types of infrastructure and operations, and the United States government has warned companies to be prepared for a significant increase in Russian cyberattacks in response to the Sanctions on Russia. \nA security breach or incident, or an attack against our service availability suffered by us, or our third-party service providers, could impact our networks or networks secured by our products and subscriptions, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, the information stored or otherwise processed on our networks, or those of our third-party service providers, could be accessed, publicly disclosed, altered, lost, stolen, rendered unavailable, or otherwise used or processed without authorization, which could subject us to liability and cause us financial harm. Any actual or perceived breach of security in our systems or networks, or any other actual or perceived data security incident we or our third-party service providers suffer, could result in significant damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of channel partners, end-customers, and sales, loss of competitive advantages over our competitors, increased costs to remedy any problems and otherwise respond to any incident, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, demands, costly litigation, and other liability. In addition, we may incur significant costs and operational consequences of investigating, remediating, eliminating, and putting in place additional tools, devices, and other measures designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches and other security incidents, as well as the costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from any security incidents. Any of these negative outcomes could adversely impact the market perception of our products and subscriptions and end-customer and investor confidence in our company and could seriously harm our business or operating results. \nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our products, subscriptions, or support offerings, the failure of our products or subscriptions to block a virus or prevent a security breach or incident, misuse of our products, or risks of product liability claims could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operating results.\nBecause our products and subscriptions are complex, they have contained and may contain design or manufacturing defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our end-customers. For example, from time to time, certain of our end-customers have reported defects in our products related to performance, scalability, and compatibility. Additionally, defects may cause our products or subscriptions to be vulnerable to security attacks, cause them to fail to help secure networks, or temporarily interrupt end-customers\u2019 networking traffic. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and provide a solution in time to protect our end-customers\u2019 networks. In addition, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there could be a significant increase in Russian cyberattacks against our customers, resulting in an increased risk of a security breach of our end-customers\u2019 systems. Furthermore, defects or errors in our subscription updates or our products could result in a failure to effectively update end-customers\u2019 hardware and cloud-based products. Our data centers and networks may experience technical failures and downtime or may fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing installed end-customer base, any of which could temporarily or permanently expose our end-customers\u2019 networks, leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats. Moreover, our products must interoperate with our end-customers\u2019 existing infrastructure, which often have varied specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards, deploy products from multiple vendors, and contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems. \n- 22 \n-\nTable of Contents\nThe occurrence of any such problem in our products and subscriptions, whether real or perceived, could result in:\n\u2022\nexpenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work-around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities;\n\u2022\nloss of existing or potential end-customers or channel partners;\n\u2022\ndelayed or lost revenue;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to attain market acceptance;\n\u2022\nan increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or an increased cost of servicing warranty claims, either of which would adversely affect our gross margins; and\n\u2022\nlitigation, regulatory inquiries, investigations, or other proceedings, each of which may be costly and harm our\u00a0reputation.\nFurther, our products and subscriptions may be misused by end-customers or third parties that obtain access to our products and subscriptions. For example, our products and subscriptions could be used to censor private access to certain information on the Internet. Such use of our products and subscriptions for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation.\nThe limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal, state, or local laws or ordinances, or unfavorable judicial decisions in the United States or other countries. The sale and support of our products and subscriptions also entails the risk of product liability claims. Although we may be indemnified by our third-party manufacturers for product liability claims arising out of manufacturing defects, because we control the design of our products and subscriptions, we may not be indemnified for product liability claims arising out of design defects. While we maintain insurance coverage for certain types of losses, our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us, if at all. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management\u2019s time and other resources, and harm our reputation.\nIn addition, our classifications of application type, virus, spyware, vulnerability exploits, data, or URL categories may falsely detect, report, and act on applications, content, or threats that do not actually exist. This risk is heightened by the inclusion of a \u201cheuristics\u201d feature in our products and subscriptions, which attempts to identify applications and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies which indicate that a particular item may be a threat. These false positives may impair the perceived reliability of our products and subscriptions and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products and subscriptions and could result in damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of channel partners, end-customers and sales, increased costs to remedy any problem, and costly litigation.\nOur ability to sell our products and subscriptions is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and those of our channel partners, and the failure to offer high-quality technical support services could have a material adverse effect on our end-customers\u2019 satisfaction with our products and subscriptions, our sales, and our operating\u00a0results.\nAfter our products and subscriptions are deployed within our end-customers\u2019 networks, our end-customers depend on our technical support services, as well as the support of our channel partners, to resolve any issues relating to our products. Many larger enterprise, service provider, and government entity end-customers have more complex networks and require higher levels of support than smaller end-customers. If our channel partners do not effectively provide support to the satisfaction of our end-customers, we may be required to provide direct support to such end-customers, which would require us to hire additional personnel and to invest in additional resources. If we are not able to hire such resources fast enough to keep up with unexpected demand, support to our end-customers will be negatively impacted, and our end-customers\u2019 satisfaction with our products and subscriptions will be adversely affected. Additionally, to the extent that we may need to rely on our sales engineers to provide post-sales support while we are ramping up our support resources, our sales productivity will be negatively impacted, which would harm our revenues. Accordingly, our failure, or our channel partners\u2019 failure, to provide and maintain high-quality support services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TECHNOLOGY LICENSING\nClaims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business.\nCompanies in the enterprise security industry own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, non-practicing entities also frequently bring claims of infringement of intellectual property rights. Third parties are asserting, have asserted, and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. \n- 23 \n-\nTable of Contents\nThird parties may also assert such claims against our end-customers or channel partners, whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against claims that our products and subscriptions infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited, that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product. Furthermore, we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology, products, subscriptions, and services. As we expand our footprint, both in our platforms, products, subscriptions, and services and geographically, more overlaps occur and we may face more infringement claims both in the United States and abroad. \nWhile we have been increasing the size of our patent portfolio, our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have. In addition, litigation has involved and will likely continue to involve patent-holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. In addition, we have not registered our trademarks in all of our geographic markets and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our ability to enforce and defend our trademark rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distract our management from our business, and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. A successful claimant could secure a judgment, or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages, royalties, or other fees. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce or protect, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products or subscriptions without compensating us.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We have filed various applications for certain aspects of our intellectual property. Valid patents may not issue from our pending applications, and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products and subscriptions. We cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection, which could prevent our patent applications from issuing as patents or invalidate our patents following issuance. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us. Additional uncertainty may result from changes to patent-related laws and court rulings in the United States and other jurisdictions. As a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce any issued patents.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or subscriptions or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors, and end-customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot be certain that we have entered into such agreements with all parties who may have or have had access to our confidential information or that the agreements we have entered into will not be breached. We cannot guarantee that any of the measures we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology. Because we may be an attractive target for computer hackers, we may have a greater risk of unauthorized access to, and misappropriation of, our proprietary information. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States. From time to time, we may need to take legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us or result in a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights (including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights), we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense, time, and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n- 24 \n-\nTable of Contents\nOur use of open source software in our products and subscriptions could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subscriptions and subject us to possible litigation.\nOur products and subscriptions contain software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under \u201copen source\u201d licenses. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available applicable source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similar products or subscriptions with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products and subscriptions to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and subscriptions. From time to time, there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and subscriptions, asserting that open source software infringes the claimants\u2019 intellectual property rights. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software. If we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products and subscriptions on terms that are not economically feasible, to reengineer our products and subscriptions, to discontinue the sale of our products and subscriptions if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or assurance of title or controls on origin of the software. In addition, many of the risks associated with usage of open source software, such as the lack of warranties or assurances of title, cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source software, but we cannot be sure that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products and subscriptions will be effective. \nWe license technology from third parties, and our inability to maintain those licenses could harm our business.\nWe incorporate technology that we license from third parties, including software, into our products and subscriptions. We cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our products and subscriptions. In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. Some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated for convenience by them. We may also be subject to additional fees or be required to obtain new licenses if any of our licensors allege that we have not properly paid for such licenses or that we have improperly used the technologies under such licenses, and such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to continue to license any of this technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our licensors or against us, or claims against us by our licensors, or if we are unable to continue our license agreements or enter into new licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop and sell products and subscriptions containing such technology would be severely limited and our business could be harmed. Additionally, if we are unable to license necessary technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology, which we may be unable to do in a commercially feasible manner or at all, and we may be required to use alternative technology of lower quality or performance standards. This would limit and delay our ability to offer new or competitive products and subscriptions and increase our costs of production. As a result, our margins, market share, and operating results could be significantly harmed.\nRISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONS\nBecause we depend on manufacturing partners to build and ship our hardware products, we are susceptible to manufacturing and logistics delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time, if at all, or on a cost-effective basis, which may result in the loss of sales and end-customers.\nWe depend on manufacturing partners, primarily our EMS provider, Flex, to manufacture our hardware product lines. Our reliance on these manufacturing partners reduces our control over the manufacturing process and exposes us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, product supply, timing, and transportation risk. Our hardware products are manufactured by our manufacturing partners at facilities located primarily in the United States. Some of the components in our products are sourced either through Flex or directly by us from component suppliers outside the United States. The portion of our hardware products that are sourced outside the United States may subject us to geopolitical risks, additional logistical risks or risks associated with complying with local rules and regulations in foreign countries. \n- 25 \n-\nTable of Contents\nSignificant changes to existing international trade agreements could lead to sourcing or logistics disruption resulting from import delays or the imposition of increased tariffs on our sourcing partners. For example, the United States and Chinese governments have each enacted, and discussed additional, import tariffs. Some components that we import for final manufacturing in the United States have been impacted by these tariffs. As a result, our costs have increased and we have raised, and may be required to further raise, prices on our hardware products, all of which could severely impair our ability to fulfill orders. \nOur manufacturing partners typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders. We do not have long-term contracts with these manufacturers that guarantee capacity, the continuation of particular pricing terms, or the extension of credit limits. Accordingly, they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we pay for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice. Our contract with Flex permits them to terminate the agreement for their convenience, subject to prior notice requirements. If we are required to change manufacturing partners, our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end-customers could be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end-customers, delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins. Any production interruptions for any reason, such as a natural disaster, epidemic or pandemic, capacity shortages, or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would negatively affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nManaging the supply of our hardware products and product components is complex. Insufficient supply and inventory would result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory would harm our gross\u00a0margins.\nOur manufacturing partners procure components and build our hardware products based on our forecasts, and we generally do not hold inventory for a prolonged period of time. These forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and analyses from our sales and product management organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply, from time to time we may issue forecasts for components and products that are non-cancelable and non-returnable.\nOur inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to forecast accurately and effectively manage supply of our hardware products and product components. If we ultimately determine that we have excess supply, we may have to reduce our prices and write-down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins. If our actual component usage and product demand are lower than the forecast we provide to our manufacturing partners, we accrue for losses on manufacturing commitments in excess of forecasted demand. Alternatively, insufficient supply levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed hardware product revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential end-customers turn to competitors\u2019 products that are readily available. If we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nBecause some of the key components in our hardware products come from limited sources of supply, we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes, which, in certain cases, have disrupted or delayed our scheduled product deliveries to our end-customers, increased our costs and may result in the loss of sales and end-customers.\nOur hardware products rely on key components, including integrated circuit components, which our manufacturing partners purchase on our behalf from a limited number of component suppliers, including sole source providers. The manufacturing operations of some of our component suppliers are geographically concentrated in Asia and elsewhere, which makes our supply chain vulnerable to regional disruptions, such as natural disasters, fire, political instability, civil unrest, power outages, or health risks. In addition, we continue to experience supply chain disruption and have incurred increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures. We are also monitoring the tensions between China and Taiwan, and between the U.S. and China, which could have an adverse impact on our business or results of operations in future\u00a0periods.\nFurther, we do not have volume purchase contracts with any of our component suppliers, and they could cease selling to us at any time. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components in a timely manner for any reason, sales of our hardware products could be delayed or halted, or we could be forced to expedite shipment of such components or our hardware products at dramatically increased costs. Our component suppliers also change their selling prices frequently in response to market trends, including industry-wide increases in demand. Because we do not have, for the most part, volume purchase contracts with our component suppliers, we are susceptible to price fluctuations related to raw materials and components and may not be able to adjust our prices accordingly. Additionally, poor quality in any of the sole-sourced components in our products could result in lost sales or sales\u00a0opportunities.\nIf we are unable to obtain a sufficient volume of the necessary components for our hardware products on commercially reasonable terms or the quality of the components do not meet our requirements, we could also be forced to redesign our products and qualify new components from alternate component suppliers. The resulting stoppage or delay in selling our hardware products and the expense of redesigning our hardware products would result in lost sales opportunities and damage to customer relationships, which would adversely affect our business and operating results.\n- 26 \n-\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to attract, retain, and motivate our key technical, sales, and management personnel, our business could suffer.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate the members of our management team and other key employees. For example, we are substantially dependent on the continued service of our engineering personnel because of the complexity of our offerings. Competition for highly skilled personnel, particularly in engineering, including in the areas of AI and machine learning, is often intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we have a substantial presence and need for such personnel. In addition, the industry in which we operate generally experiences high employee attrition. Our future performance depends on the continuing services and contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. If we are unable to hire, integrate, train, or retain the qualified and highly skilled personnel required to fulfill our current or future needs, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.\nFurther, we believe that a critical contributor to our success and our ability to retain highly skilled personnel has been our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, inclusion, teamwork, passion for end-customers, focus on execution, and the facilitation of critical knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing. As we grow and change, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our corporate culture. While we are taking steps to develop a more inclusive and diverse workforce, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so. Any failure to preserve our culture as we grow could limit our ability to innovate and could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, continue to perform at current levels or execute on our business strategy.\nWe generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to distributors, resellers, and end-customers outside of the United States, and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations.\nOur ability to grow our business and our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide. Many of our customers, resellers, partners, suppliers, and manufacturers operate around the world. Operating in a global marketplace, we are subject to risks associated with having an international reach and compliance and regulatory requirements. We may experience difficulties in attracting, managing, and retaining an international staff, and we may not be able to recruit and maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally. Business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the United States and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms related to payment, warranties, or performance obligations in end-customer contracts. \nAdditionally, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\npolitical, economic, and social uncertainty around the world, health risks such as epidemics and pandemics like COVID-19, macroeconomic challenges in Europe, terrorist activities, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, tensions between China and Taiwan, and continued hostilities in the Middle East;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in, or the application of, foreign and domestic laws and regulations (including intellectual property rights protections), regulatory practices, trade restrictions, and foreign legal requirements, including those applicable to the importation, certification, and localization of our products, tariffs, and tax laws and treaties, including regulatory and trade policy changes adopted by the current administration, such as the Sanctions on Russia, or foreign countries in response to regulatory changes adopted by the current administration; and\n\u2022\nnon-compliance with U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, U.S. or foreign sanctions regimes and export or import control laws, and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices.\nThese and other factors could harm our future international revenues and, consequently, materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. The expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources. Our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk; however, in the event of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business, the cost of our products to our end-customers outside of the United States would increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In addition, increased international sales in the future, including through our channel partners and other partnerships, may result in foreign currency denominated sales, increasing our foreign currency risk. \n- 27 \n-\nTable of Contents\nOur operating expenses incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies are generally increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. We have entered into forward contracts in an effort to reduce our foreign currency exchange exposure related to our foreign currency denominated expenditures. As of July\u00a031, 2023, the total notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was $\n957.5\n\u00a0million. For more information on our hedging transactions, refer to Note\u00a06. Derivative Instruments in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The effectiveness of our existing hedging transactions and the availability and effectiveness of any hedging transactions we may decide to enter into in the future may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe face risks associated with having operations and employees located in Israel.\nAs a result of various of our acquisitions, including Cider, Cyber Secdo Ltd. (\u201cSecdo\u201d), PureSec Ltd. (\u201cPureSec\u201d), and Twistlock Ltd. (\u201cTwistlock\u201d), we have offices and employees located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic, and military conditions in Israel directly affect our operations, including the recent political unrest in Israel. The future of peace efforts between Israel and its Arab neighbors remains uncertain. The effects of hostilities and violence on the Israeli economy and our operations in Israel are unclear, and we cannot predict the effect on us of further increases in these hostilities or future armed conflict, political instability, or violence in the region. Current or future tensions and conflicts in the Middle East could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIn addition, many of our employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israeli military and are subject to being called for active duty under emergency circumstances. We cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us in the future, particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in the political situation occurs. If many of our employees in Israel are called for active duty for a significant period of time, our operations and our business could be disrupted and may not be able to function at full capacity. Any disruption in our operations in Israel could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nBecause we incorporate encryption technology into our products, certain of our products are subject to U.S. export controls and may be exported outside the United States only with the required export license or through an export license exception. If we were to fail to comply with U.S. export licensing requirements, U.S. customs regulations, U.S. economic sanctions, or other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines, incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, and persons. Even though we take precautions to ensure that our channel partners comply with all relevant regulations, any failure by our channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations, and penalties.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our end-customers\u2019 ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets, prevent our end-customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent or delay the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions, such as the Sanctions on Russia, or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential end-customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export to or sell our products in international markets would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n- 28 \n-\nTable of Contents\nRISKS RELATED TO PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION\nOur actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could have a material adverse effect on our\u00a0business.\nA wide variety of laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data in jurisdictions where we and our customers operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly. These laws and regulations are also subject to frequent and unexpected changes, new or additional laws or regulations may be adopted, and rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations may be issued. For example, we are subject to the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cE.U. GDPR\u201d) and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (\u2018U.K. GDPR,\u201d and collectively the \u201cGDPR\u201d), both of which impose stringent data protection requirements, provide for costly penalties for noncompliance (up to the greater of (a) \u20ac20\u00a0million under the \u201cE.U. GDPR\u201d or \u00a317.5 million under the \u201cU.K. GDPR,\u201d and (b) 4% of annual worldwide turnover), and confer the right upon data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations.\nThe GDPR requires, among other things, that personal data be transferred outside of the E.U. (or, in the case of the U.K. GDPR, the U.K.) to the United States and other jurisdictions only where adequate safeguards are implemented or a derogation applies. In practice, we rely on standard contractual clauses approved under the GDPR to carry out such transfers and to receive personal data subject to the GDPR (directly or indirectly) in the United States. In the future, we may self-certify to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (\u201cEU-U.S. DPF\u201d), which has been approved for transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to the United States and requires public disclosures of adherence to data protection principles and the submission of jurisdiction to European regulatory authorities. Following the \u201cSchrems\u00a0II\u201d decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union, transfers of personal data to recipients in third countries are also subject to additional assessments and safeguards beyond the implementation of approved transfer mechanisms. The decision imposed a requirement for companies to carry out an assessment of the laws and practices governing access to personal data in the third country to ensure an essentially equivalent level of data protection to that afforded in the E.U. \nAmong other effects, we may experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens, reduced demand for our offerings from current or prospective customers in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), Switzerland, and the U.K. (collectively, \u201cEurope\u201d) to use our products, on account of the risks identified in the Schrems II decision, and we may find it necessary or desirable to make further changes to our processing of personal data of European residents. The regulatory environment applicable to the handling of European residents\u2019 personal data, and our actions taken in response, may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs, including in the event we self-certify to the EU-U.S. DPF. Moreover, much like with Schrems II, we anticipate future legal challenges to the approved data transfer mechanisms between Europe and the United States, including a challenge to the EU-U.S. DPF. Such legal challenges could result in additional legal and regulatory risk, compliance costs, and in our business, operating results, and financial condition being harmed. Additionally, we and our customers may face risk of enforcement actions by data protection authorities in Europe relating to personal data transfers to us and by us from Europe. Any such enforcement actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and distract management and technical personnel. These potential liabilities and enforcement actions could also have an overall negative affect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, the \u201cCCPA\u201d). The CCPA requires, among other things, covered companies to provide enhanced disclosures to California consumers and to afford such consumers certain rights regarding their personal data, including the right to opt out of data sales for targeted advertising, and creates a private right of action to individuals affected by a data breach, if the breach was caused by a lack of reasonable security. The effects of the CCPA have been significant, requiring us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses for compliance. Moreover, additional state privacy laws have been passed and will require potentially substantial efforts to obtain compliance. These include laws enacted in at least ten states, which all go into effect by January 1, 2026. \nWe may also from time to time be subject to obligations relating to personal data by contract, or face assertions that we are subject to self-regulatory obligations or industry standards. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are more regularly bringing enforcement actions in connection with federal and state consumer protection laws for false or deceptive acts or practices in relation to the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of personal data. Internationally, data localization laws may mandate that personal data collected in a foreign country be processed and stored within that country. New legislation affecting the scope of personal data and personal information where we or our customers and partners have operations, especially relating to classification of Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) addresses, machine identification, AI, location data, and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing or uses of data, and may require significant expenditures and efforts in order to comply. Notably, public perception of potential privacy, data protection, or information security concerns\u2014whether or not valid\u2014may harm our reputation and inhibit adoption of our products and subscriptions by current and future end-customers. Each of these laws and regulations, and any changes to these laws and regulations, or new laws and regulations, could impose significant limitations, or require changes to our business model or practices or growth strategy, which may increase our compliance expenses and make our business more costly or less efficient to conduct.\n- 29 \n-\nTable of Contents\nTax, Accounting, Compliance, and Regulatory Risks\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop, value, and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and various other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions may aggressively interpret their laws, regulations, and policies, including in an effort to raise additional tax revenue. The tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed or acquired technology or determining the proper charges for intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Some tax authorities of jurisdictions other than the United States may seek to assert extraterritorial taxing rights on our transactions or operations. It is possible that domestic or international tax authorities may subject us to tax examinations, or audits, and such tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such an examination, review or audit could result in additional tax liabilities and penalties and otherwise have a negative effect on our financial position and operating results. Further, the determination of our worldwide provision for or benefit from income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded on our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nIn addition, our future income tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in, or interpretations of, tax laws, regulations, policies, or decisions in the United States or in the other jurisdictions in which we operate. \nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported on our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. For more information, refer to the section entitled \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In general, if our estimates, judgments, or assumptions relating to our critical accounting policies change or if actual circumstances differ from our estimates, judgments, or assumptions, our operating results may be adversely affected and could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nWe are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or our internal control may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal controls are effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If, in the future, our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, or independent registered public accounting firm determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404, we could be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies, stockholder lawsuits, or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs, pay fines, settlements, or judgments, causing investor perceptions to be adversely affected and potentially resulting in a decline in the market price of our stock.\nOur reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.\nThere is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors, and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters, both in the United States and internationally. We communicate certain ESG-related initiatives, goals, and/or commitments regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments, and other matters in our annual ESG Report, on our website, in our filings with the SEC, and elsewhere. These initiatives, goals, or commitments could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. We could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments. In addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives, goals, or commitments, or for any revisions to them. To the extent that our required and voluntary disclosures about ESG matters increase, we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of such disclosures. Our actual or perceived failure to achieve our ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments could negatively impact our reputation, result in ESG-focused investors not purchasing and holding our stock, or otherwise materially harm our business.\n- 30 \n-\nTable of Contents\nFailure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, privacy, data security, and data-protection laws, anti-bribery laws (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act), import/export controls, federal securities laws, and tax laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may also impact our innovation and business drivers in developing new and emerging technologies (e.g., AI and machine learning). In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation resulting from any alleged noncompliance, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions, litigation, and sanctions could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Notes and Common Stock\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our Notes, repurchase our Notes upon a fundamental change, or repay our Notes in cash at their maturity, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of our Notes.\nIn June 2020, we issued our 2025 Notes (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d). We will need to make cash payments (a)\u00a0if holders of our 2025 Notes require us to repurchase all, or a portion of, their 2025 Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (e.g., a change of control of Palo Alto Networks,\u00a0Inc.) before the maturity date, (b)\u00a0upon conversion of our 2025 Notes, or (c)\u00a0to repay our 2025 Notes in cash at their maturity unless earlier converted or repurchased. Effective August 1, 2023 through October 31, 2023, all of the 2025 Notes are convertible. If all of the note holders decided to convert their 2025 Notes, we would be obligated to pay the $2.0 billion principal amount of the 2025 Notes in cash. Under the terms of the 2025 Notes, we also have the option to settle the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes in cash or shares of our common stock. If our cash provided by operating activities, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments, and existing sources of financing, are inadequate to satisfy these obligations, we will need to obtain third-party financing, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, to meet these payment obligations.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of our 2025 Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority, or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase our 2025 Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture governing such 2025 Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of such 2025 Notes as required by the applicable indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the applicable indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase our 2025 Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of our 2025 Notes.\nWe may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions that would diminish our ability to make payments on our Notes when due.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our Notes when due. \nThe market price of our common stock historically has been volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock could decline.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our business, operating results, or financial condition. These fluctuations could cause a loss of all or part of an investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products, subscriptions or technologies, commercial relationships, strategic partnerships, acquisitions, or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nnews announcements that affect investor perception of our industry, including reports related to the discovery of significant cyberattacks;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general and of companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n- 31 \n-\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our operating results or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nwhether our operating results meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in the expectations of securities analysts or investors, whether as a result of our forward-looking statements, our failure to meet such expectations or otherwise;\n\u2022\ninaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business and industry published by securities analysts or reduced coverage of our company by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both;\n\u2022\nactions instituted by activist shareholders or others; \n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries, or both;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nsales or repurchases of large blocks of our common stock or substantial future sales by our directors, executive officers, employees, and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel; or\n\u2022\ngeopolitical or economic uncertainty around the world.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the sale of our 2025 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the \u201c2025 Note Hedges\u201d) with certain counterparties. In connection with each such sale of the 2025 Notes, we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants (the \u201c2025 Warrants\u201d) for the purchase of our common stock. In addition, we also entered into warrant transactions in connection with our 2023 Notes (together with the 2025 Warrants, the \u201cWarrants\u201d). The Note Hedges for our 2025 Notes are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of our 2025 Notes. The Warrants could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the Warrants unless, subject to certain conditions, we elect to cash settle such Warrants.\nThe applicable counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the outstanding 2025 Notes (and are likely to do so during any applicable observation period related to a conversion of our 2025 Notes). This activity could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or our 2025 Notes, which could affect a note holder\u2019s ability to convert its 2025 Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of our 2025 Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that the note holder will receive upon conversion of our 2025 Notes.\nWe do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of our 2025 Notes or our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties or their respective affiliates will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.\nThe issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans, the conversion of our Notes or exercise of the related Warrants, or otherwise will dilute stock held by all other stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1.0\u00a0billion shares of common stock and up to 100.0\u00a0million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our stock incentive plans, the conversion of our Notes, the settlement of our Warrants related to each such series of the Notes, or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\n- 32 \n-\nTable of Contents\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance shareholder value, and share repurchases could affect the price of our common stock.\nAs of July\u00a031, 2023, we had $\n750.0\n\u00a0million available under our share repurchase program which will expire on December\u00a031, 2023. Such share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued by the Company at any time without prior notice. Although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program, we are not obligated to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares under the program. The share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock, increase volatility, and diminish our cash reserves. In addition, the program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the price of our common stock. \nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. As a result,\u00a0stockholders may only receive a return on their investments in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law, as well as certain provisions contained in the indentures governing our Notes, could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment, which could also reduce the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nestablish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class\u00a0I, Class\u00a0II, and Class\u00a0III, with three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nprovide our board of directors with the exclusive right to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director;\n\u2022\nprohibit our stockholders from taking action by written consent;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our president, our secretary, or a majority vote of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66\u00a02/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to amend our bylaws by majority vote; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures with which our stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for our stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time. Additionally, certain provisions contained in the indenture governing our Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. The application of Section\u00a0203 or certain provisions contained in the indenture governing our Notes also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us. Any of these provisions could, under certain circumstances, depress the market price of our common stock. \n- 33 \n-\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, health risks, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems, such as terrorism.\nBoth our corporate headquarters and the location where our products are manufactured are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. In addition, other natural disasters, such as fire or floods, a significant power outage, telecommunications failure, terrorism, an armed conflict, cyberattacks, epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19, or other geo-political unrest could affect our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, channel partners, end-customers, or the economy as a whole, and such disruption could impact our shipments and sales. These risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. To the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, the loss of customers, or the delay in the manufacture, deployment, or shipment of our products, our business, financial condition, and operating results would be adversely affected.\nOur failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products and subscriptions could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features to enhance our portfolio, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we engage in future debt financings, the holders of such additional debt would have priority over the holders of our common stock. Current and future indebtedness may also contain terms that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, we may be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders and would require us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be adversely affected.\n- 34 \n-\nTable of Contents",

Our cybersecurity platforms and services help secure enterprise users, networks, clouds, and endpoints by delivering comprehensive cybersecurity backed by industry-leading artificial intelligence and automation. We are a leading provider of zero trust solutions, starting with next-generation zero trust network access to secure today\u2019s remote hybrid workforces and extending to securing all users, applications, and infrastructure with zero trust principles. Our security solutions are designed to reduce customers\u2019 total cost of ownership by improving operational efficiency and eliminating the need for siloed point products. Our company focuses on delivering value in four fundamental areas:\nNetwork Security:\n\u2022\nOur network security platform, designed to deliver complete zero trust solutions to our customers, includes our hardware and software ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewalls, as well as a cloud-delivered Secure Access Service Edge (\u201cSASE\u201d). Prisma\n\u00ae\n Access, our Security Services Edge (\u201cSSE\u201d) solution, when combined with Prisma SD-WAN, provides a comprehensive single-vendor SASE offering that is used to secure remote workforces and enable the cloud-delivered branch. We have been recognized as a leader in network firewalls, SSE, and SD-WAN. Our network security platform also includes our cloud-delivered security services, such as Advanced Threat Prevention, Advanced WildFire\n\u00ae\n, Advanced URL Filtering, DNS Security, IoT/OT Security, GlobalProtect\n\u00ae\n, Enterprise Data Loss Prevention (\u201cEnterprise DLP\u201d), Artificial Intelligence for Operations (\u201cAIOps\u201d), SaaS Security API, and SaaS Security Inline. Through these add-on security services, our customers are able to secure their content, applications, users, and devices across their entire organization. Panorama\n\u00ae\n, our network security management solution, can centrally manage our network security platform irrespective of form factor, location, or scale.\nCloud Security:\n\u2022\nWe enable cloud-native security through our Prisma Cloud platform. As a comprehensive Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (\u201cCNAPP\u201d), Prisma Cloud secures multi- and hybrid-cloud environments for applications, data, and the entire cloud native technology stack across the full development lifecycle; from code to runtime. For inline\u00a0network security on multi- and hybrid-cloud environments, we also offer our VM-Series and CN-Series Firewall\u00a0offerings.\n- 38 \n-\nTable of Contents\nSecurity Operations:\n\u2022\nWe deliver the next generation of security automation, security analytics, endpoint security, and attack surface management solutions through our Cortex portfolio. These include Cortex XSIAM, our AI security automation platform, Cortex XDR\n\u00ae\n for the prevention, detection, and response to complex cybersecurity attacks on the endpoint, Cortex XSOAR\n\u00ae\n for security orchestration, automation, and response (\u201cSOAR\u201d), and Cortex Xpanse\nTM\n for attack surface management (\u201cASM\u201d). These products are delivered as SaaS or software subscriptions.\nThreat Intelligence and Security Consulting (Unit 42):\n\u2022\nUnit 42 brings together world-renowned threat researchers with an elite team of incident responders and security consultants to create an intelligence-driven, response-ready organization to help customers proactively manage cyber risk. Our consultants serve as trusted advisors to our customers by assessing and testing their security controls against the right threats, transforming their security strategy with a threat-informed approach, and responding to security incidents on behalf of our clients.\nFor fiscal 2023 and 2022, total revenue was $6.9 billion and $5.5\u00a0billion, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 25.3%. Our growth reflects the increased adoption of our portfolio, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support. We believe our portfolio will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues and new revenues as we continue to grow our end-customer base. As of July\u00a031, 2023, we had end-customers in over 180\u00a0countries. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries, including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications, and include almost all of the Fortune\u00a0100 companies and a majority of the Global\u00a02000 companies. We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We primarily use a two-tiered, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products, subscriptions, and support to our distributors, which, in turn, sell to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers. \nOur product revenue grew to $1.6 billion or 22.9% of total revenue for fiscal 2023, representing year-over-year growth of 15.8%. Product revenue is derived from sales of our appliances, primarily our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama, SD-WAN, and the VM-Series. Our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall incorporates our PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire network security product line. Our appliances and software licenses include a broad set of built-in networking and security features and functionalities. Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from our PA-410, which is designed for small organizations and remote or branch offices, to our top-of-the-line PA-7080, which is designed for large-scale data centers and service provider use. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in our physical appliances is also available in our VM-Series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments, and in our CN-Series container firewalls, which secure container environments and traffic.\nOur subscription and support revenue grew to $5.3 billion or 77.1% of total revenue for fiscal 2023, representing year-over-year growth of 28.4%. Our subscriptions provide our end-customers with near real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, modern malware prevention, data loss prevention, and cloud access security broker capabilities across the network, endpoints, and the cloud. When end-customers purchase our physical, virtual, or container firewall appliances, or certain cloud offerings, they typically purchase support in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs. In addition to the subscriptions purchased with these appliances, end-customers may also purchase other subscriptions on a per-user, per-endpoint, or capacity-based basis. We also offer professional services, including incident response, risk management, and digital forensic\u00a0services.\nWe continue to invest in innovation as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our portfolio, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products are essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. During fiscal 2023, we introduced several new offerings, including: Cortex XSIAM\u00a01.0, major updates to Prisma Cloud (including three new security modules), Prisma Access\u00a04.0, PAN-OS\u00a011.0, Cloud NGFW for AWS, and Cloud NGFW for Azure. Additionally, we acquired productive investments that fit well within our long-term strategy. For example, in December 2022, we acquired Cider, which we expect will support our Prisma Cloud\u2019s platform approach to securing the entire application security lifecycle from code to cloud.\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our portfolio and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. For additional information regarding the challenges and risks we face, see the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in Part\u00a0I, Item\u00a01A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n- 39 \n-\nTable of Contents\nImpact of Macroeconomic Developments and Other Factors on Our Business\nOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions and their impact on customer behavior. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, higher interest rates, slower growth, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and other conditions, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance. \nWe continue to experience supply chain disruption and incur increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures. We are monitoring the tensions between China and Taiwan, and between the U.S. and China, which could have an adverse impact on our business or results of operations in future periods.\nKey Financial Metrics \nWe monitor the key financial metrics set forth in the tables below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss\u00a0revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating income (loss) and margin below under \u201cResults of\u00a0Operations.\u201d\nJuly 31,\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nTotal deferred revenue\n$\n9,296.4\u00a0\n$\n6,994.0\u00a0\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments\n$\n5,437.9\u00a0\n$\n4,686.4\u00a0\nYear Ended July 31,\n2023\n2022\n2021\n(dollars in millions)\nTotal revenue\n$\n6,892.7\u00a0\n$\n5,501.5\u00a0\n$\n4,256.1\u00a0\nTotal revenue year-over-year percentage increase\n25.3\u00a0\n%\n29.3\u00a0\n%\n24.9\u00a0\n%\nGross margin\n72.3\u00a0\n%\n68.8\u00a0\n%\n70.0\u00a0\n%\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n387.3\u00a0\n$\n(188.8)\n$\n(304.1)\nOperating margin\n5.6\u00a0\n%\n(3.4)\n%\n(7.1)\n%\nBillings\n$\n9,194.4\u00a0\n$\n7,471.5\u00a0\n$\n5,452.2\u00a0\nBillings year-over-year percentage increase\n23.1\u00a0\n%\n37.0\u00a0\n%\n26.7\u00a0\n%\nCash flow provided by operating activities\n$\n2,777.5\u00a0\n$\n1,984.7\u00a0\n$\n1,503.0\u00a0\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)\n$\n2,631.2\u00a0\n$\n1,791.9\u00a0\n$\n1,387.0\u00a0\n\u2022\nDeferred Revenue.\n Our deferred revenue primarily consists of amounts that have been invoiced but have not been recognized as revenue as of the period end. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods.\n\u2022\nBillings.\n We define billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. We consider billings to be a key metric used by management to manage our business. We believe billings provides investors with an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business because it includes subscription and support revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual service period, and product revenue, which is recognized at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license, provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly if we continue to experience increased sales of subscriptions and strong renewal rates for subscription and support offerings, and as we monitor our near-term cash flows. While we believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. We calculate billings in the following manner:\n- 40 \n-\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended July 31,\n2023\n2022\n2021\n(in millions)\nBillings:\nTotal revenue\n$\n6,892.7\u00a0\n$\n5,501.5\u00a0\n$\n4,256.1\u00a0\nAdd: change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred\u00a0revenue\n2,301.7\u00a0\n1,970.0\u00a0\n1,196.1\u00a0\nBillings\n$\n9,194.4\u00a0\n$\n7,471.5\u00a0\n$\n5,452.2\u00a0\n\u2022\nCash Flow Provided by Operating Activities.\n We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for subscription and support offerings. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as share-based compensation costs, depreciation and amortization, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.\n\u2022\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP).\n We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the corresponding promised products and subscriptions and support to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products and subscriptions and support. We expect our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors. \nPRODUCT REVENUE\nProduct revenue is derived from sales of our appliances, primarily our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama, SD-WAN, and the VM-Series. Our appliances and software licenses include a broad set of built-in networking and security features and functionalities. We recognize product revenue at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license.\nYear Ended July 31,\nYear Ended July 31,\n\u00a0\n2023\n2022\nChange\n2022\n2021\nChange\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\n\u00a0\n(dollars in millions)\nProduct\n$\n1,578.4\u00a0\n$\n1,363.1\u00a0\n$\n215.3\u00a0\n15.8\u00a0\n%\n$\n1,363.1\u00a0\n$\n1,120.3\u00a0\n$\n242.8\u00a0\n21.7\u00a0\n%\nProduct revenue increased for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 driven by increased demand for our new generation of hardware products, increased software revenue primarily due to a new go-to-market strategy for certain Network Security offerings and an increased demand for our VM-Series virtual firewalls, partially offset by decreased revenue from our prior generation of hardware products. \nSUBSCRIPTION AND SUPPORT REVENUE\nSubscription and support revenue is derived primarily from sales of our subscription and support offerings. Our subscription and support contracts are typically one to five years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support over time as the services are performed. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our subscription and support revenue to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing subscription and support contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base.\nYear Ended July 31,\nYear Ended July 31,\n\u00a0\n2023\n2022\nChange\n2022\n2021\nChange\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\n\u00a0\n(dollars in millions)\nSubscription\n$\n3,335.4\u00a0\n$\n2,539.0\u00a0\n$\n796.4\u00a0\n31.4\u00a0\n%\n$\n2,539.0\u00a0\n$\n1,898.8\u00a0\n$\n640.2\u00a0\n33.7\u00a0\n%\nSupport\n1,978.9\u00a0\n1,599.4\u00a0\n379.5\u00a0\n23.7\u00a0\n%\n1,599.4\u00a0\n1,237.0\u00a0\n362.4\u00a0\n29.3\u00a0\n%\nTotal subscription and\u00a0support\n$\n5,314.3\u00a0\n$\n4,138.4\u00a0\n$\n1,175.9\u00a0\n28.4\u00a0\n%\n$\n4,138.4\u00a0\n$\n3,135.8\u00a0\n$\n1,002.6\u00a0\n32.0\u00a0\n%\nSubscription and support revenue increased for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to increased demand for our subscription and support offerings from our end-customers.

Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, travel and entertainment, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. Our operating expenses also include shared costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount to each department.

Due to\u00a0recent profitability, a reversal of our valuation allowance in certain jurisdictions in the foreseeable future is reasonably\u00a0possible.\n\u00a0\nYear Ended July 31,\nYear Ended July 31,\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2023\n2022\nChange\n2022\n2021\nChange\n\u00a0\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\n\u00a0\n(dollars in millions)\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n126.6\u00a0\n$\n59.8\u00a0\n$\n66.8\u00a0\n111.7\u00a0\n%\n$\n59.8\u00a0\n$\n33.9\u00a0\n$\n25.9\u00a0\n76.4\u00a0\n%\nEffective tax rate\n22.4\u00a0\n%\n(28.9)\n%\n(28.9)\n%\n(7.3)\n%\nOur provision for income taxes for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to U.S. federal and state income taxes, withholding taxes, and foreign income taxes. Our effective tax rate varied for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to our profitability in fiscal 2023 and an increase in U.S. taxes driven by capitalization of research and development expenditures with no offsetting deferred benefit due to our valuation allowance. This increase was offset by releases of uncertain tax positions during fiscal 2023 resulting from tax settlements. Refer to Note 15.

As of July\u00a031, 2023, we had no unremitted earnings when evaluating our outside basis difference relating to our U.S. investment in foreign subsidiaries. However, there could be local withholding taxes due to various foreign countries if certain lower tier earnings are distributed. Withholding taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these lower tier earnings are not expected to be material.\n- 47 \n-\nTable of Contents\nDEBT\nIn July 2018, we issued the 2023 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.7\u00a0billion. The 2023 Notes were converted prior to or settled on the maturity date of July 1, 2023. During fiscal 2023, we repaid in cash $1.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes and issued 11.4\u00a0million shares of common stock to the holders for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes converted, which were fully offset by shares we received from our exercise of the associated note hedges. In June 2020, we issued the 2025 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion. The 2025 Notes mature on June\u00a01, 2025; however, under certain circumstances, holders may surrender their 2025 Notes for conversion prior to the applicable maturity date. Upon conversion of the 2025 Notes, we will pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be converted, and, at our election, will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes being converted. The sale price condition for the 2025 Notes was met during the fiscal quarter ended July\u00a031, 2023, and as a result, holders may convert their 2025 Notes during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2023. If all of the holders convert their 2025 Notes during this period, we would be obligated to settle the $2.0 billion principal amount of the 2025 Notes in cash. We believe that our cash provided by operating activities, our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, and existing sources of and access to financing will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs should the holders choose to convert their 2025 Notes during the fiscal quarter ending October\u00a031, 2023 or hold the 2025 Notes until maturity on June 1, 2025. As of July\u00a031, 2023, substantially all of our 2025 Notes remained outstanding. Refer to Note\u00a010. Debt in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Notes.\nIn April 2023, we entered into a new credit agreement (the \u201c2023 Credit Agreement\u201d) that provides for a $400.0\u00a0million unsecured revolving credit facility (the \u201c2023 Credit Facility\u201d), with an option to increase the amount of the 2023 Credit Facility by up to an additional $350.0\u00a0million, subject to certain conditions. The interest rates and commitment fees are also subject to upward and downward adjustments based on our progress towards the achievement of certain sustainability goals related to greenhouse gas emissions. As of July\u00a031, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding, and we were in compliance with all covenants under the 2023 Credit Agreement. Refer to Note\u00a010. Debt in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Credit Agreement. \nCAPITAL RETURN\nIn February 2019, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program. In December 2020, August 2021, and August 2022, our board of directors authorized additional $700.0\u00a0million, $676.1\u00a0million, and $915.0\u00a0million increases to this share repurchase program, respectively, bringing the total authorization under this share repurchase program to $3.3\u00a0billion. Repurchases will be funded from available working capital and may be made at management\u2019s discretion from time to time. The expiration date of this repurchase authorization was extended to December\u00a031, 2023, and our repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of July\u00a031, 2023, $750.0\u00a0million remained available for future share repurchases under this repurchase program. Refer to Note\u00a013. Stockholders\u2019 Equity in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on these repurchase programs. \nLEASES AND OTHER MATERIAL CASH REQUIREMENTS\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating leases primarily for our facilities with original lease periods expiring through the year ending July\u00a031, 2033, with the most significant leases relating to our corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California. As of July\u00a031, 2023, we have total operating lease obligations of $339.4\u00a0million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.\nAs of July\u00a031, 2023, our commitments to purchase products, components, cloud and other services totaled $1.8\u00a0billion. Refer to Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on these commitments.\nCASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended July\u00a031, 2023, 2022, and 2021:\nYear Ended July 31,\n2023\n2022\n2021\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,777.5\u00a0\n$\n1,984.7\u00a0\n$\n1,503.0\u00a0\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(2,033.8)\n(933.4)\n(1,480.6)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(1,726.3)\n(806.6)\n(1,104.0)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n(982.6)\n$\n244.7\u00a0\n$\n(1,081.6)\n- 48 \n-\nTable of Contents\nCash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties detailed in Part\u00a0I, Item\u00a01A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Form\u00a010-K. We believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12\u00a0months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and subscription and support offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity,\u00a0the investments in our infrastructure to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, the repayment obligations associated with our Notes, the continuing market acceptance of our products and subscription and support offerings and macroeconomic events. In addition, from time to time, we may incur additional tax liability in connection with certain corporate structuring decisions.\nWe may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOPERATING ACTIVITIES\nOur operating activities have consisted of net income (losses) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Our largest source of cash provided by our operations is receipts from our billings.\nCash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2023 was $2.8 billion, an increase of $792.8\u00a0million compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to growth of our business as reflected by increases in collections during fiscal 2023, partially offset by higher cash expenditure to support our business growth.\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES\nOur investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and business acquisitions. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.\nCash used in investing activities during fiscal 2023 was $2.0\u00a0billion, an increase of $1.1\u00a0billion compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in purchases of investments and an increase in net cash payments for business acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments during fiscal\u00a02023.\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES \nOur financing activities have consisted of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, and payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards. \nCash used in financing activities during fiscal 2023 was $1.7\u00a0billion, an increase of $919.7\u00a0million compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to repayments of our 2023 Notes upon maturity, partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2023.\nCritical Accounting Estimates \nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\u00a0assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\u00a0various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and\u00a0assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future consolidated financial statements will be\u00a0affected. \nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies described in Note\u00a01. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the critical accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\n- 49 \n-\nTable of Contents\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe majority of our contracts with our customers include various combinations of our products and subscriptions and support. Our appliances and software licenses have significant standalone functionalities and capabilities. Accordingly, these appliances and software licenses are distinct from our subscriptions and support services as the customer can benefit from the product without these services and such services are separately identifiable within the contract. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. The amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for delivering on the contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.\nWe establish standalone selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (channel partner or end-customer), the geographies in which our offerings were sold (domestic or international), and offering type (products, subscriptions, or support). As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated standalone selling prices, and as a result the timing and classification of our revenue could be affected.\nINCOME TAXES\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for all future benefits including, but not limited to, net operating losses, research and development credit carryforwards, and basis differences relating to our global intangible low-taxed income. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nWe recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nMANUFACTURING PARTNER AND SUPPLIER LIABILITIES\nWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our EMS provider, which procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts of future demand are based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. We accrue costs for manufacturing purchase commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our manufacturing partners and component suppliers. Actual component usage and product demand may be materially different from our forecast and could be caused by factors outside of our control, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Through July\u00a031, 2023, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure.\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES\nWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible, then we disclose the possible loss or range of the possible loss or state that such an estimate cannot be made. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted, or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.\n- 50 \n-\nTable of Contents\nFrom time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses. Refer to the \u201cLitigation\u201d subheading in Note\u00a012. Commitments and Contingencies in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our litigation.",
    "item7a": ">Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenditures are incurred outside of the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at July\u00a031, 2023 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. As of July\u00a031, 2023, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our consolidated financial statements. We enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 24 months or less, which we designate as cash flow hedges, to manage the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency denominated operating expenditures. The effectiveness of our existing hedging transactions and the availability and effectiveness of any hedging transactions we may decide to enter into in the future may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Refer to Note\u00a06. Derivative Instruments in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nAs our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, a weakening U.S. dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion and a strengthening U.S. dollar can increase the real cost of our products and services to our end-customers outside of the United States, leading to delays in the purchase of our products and services. For additional information, see the risk factor entitled \n\u201cWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.\u201d\n in Part\u00a01, Item\u00a01A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity, and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. Most of the securities we invest in are subject to interest rate risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain a diversified portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and investments, consisting only of investment-grade securities. To assess the interest rate risk, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio. Based on investment positions as of July\u00a031, 2023, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $55.5 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity. Conversely, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would lead to a $55.5 million increase in the fair market value of the portfolio.\nIn June 2020, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d). We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. As these instruments have a fixed annual interest rate, we have no financial and economic exposure associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate debt instruments fluctuates when interest rates change, and additionally, in the case of the 2025 Notes, when the market price of our common stock fluctuates.\n- 51 \n-\nTable of Contents",
