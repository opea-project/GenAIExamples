Our sales efforts are organized around the evolving needs of our current and targeted customers, and our marketing initiatives reflect this focus. NetApp uses a multichannel distribution strategy. We sell our products, solutions and services to end-user business customers and service providers through a direct sales force and an ecosystem of partners, including the leading cloud providers. Our marketing is focused on building our brand reputation, creating market awareness, communicating customer advantages and generating demand for our sales force and channel partners.\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur diversified customer base spans industry segments and vertical markets such as energy, financial services, government, technology, internet, life sciences, healthcare services, manufacturing, media, entertainment, animation, video postproduction and telecommunications. NetApp focuses primarily on the enterprise storage and data management, cloud storage and cloud operations markets. We design our products to meet the evolving requirements of a hybrid, multicloud world, driven by digital transformation and cloud initiatives.\n\n\nOur partnerships with the industry\u2019s leading cloud, infrastructure, consulting, application, and reseller partners are created with one goal in mind: the success of our customers. Global enterprises, local businesses, and government installations look to NetApp and our ecosystem of partners to help maximize the business value of their IT and cloud investments.\n\n\nWe work with a wide range of partners for our customers, including technology partners, value-added resellers, system integrators, OEMs, service providers and distributors. During fiscal 2023, sales through our indirect channels represented 78% of our net revenues. Our global partner ecosystem is critical to NetApp\u2019s growth and success. We are continually strengthening existing partnerships and investing in new ones to ensure we are meeting the evolving needs of our customers.\n\n\nAs of April 28, 2023, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 5,700 managers, sales representatives and technical support personnel. We have offices in approximately 25 countries. Sales to customers Arrow Electronics, Inc. and Tech Data Corporation accounted for 24% and 21% of our net revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2023. Information about sales to and accounts receivables from our major customers, segment disclosures, foreign operations and net sales attributable to our geographic regions is included in Note 15 \u2013 Segment, Geographic, and Significant Customer Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\nSeasonality\n\n\nWe have historically experienced a sequential decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year, as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth quarter, and because sales to European customers are typically weaker during the summer months. We derive a substantial amount of our revenue in any given quarter from customer orders booked in the same quarter. Customer orders and revenues typically follow intra-quarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter. If recurring services and cloud revenue continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues, historical seasonal patterns may become less pronounced.\n\n\nBacklog\n\n\nWe manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers\u2019 demand. Orders are generally placed by customers on an as-needed basis. A substantial portion of our products is sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancelable prior to shipment without penalty. In certain circumstances, purchase orders are subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements. Our business is characterized by seasonal and intra-quarter variability in demand, as well as short lead times and product delivery schedules. Accordingly, backlog at any given time may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue.\n\n\nManufacturing and Supply Chain\n\n\nWe have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in Fremont, California; San Jose, California; San Antonio, Texas; Guadalajara, Mexico; Schiphol Airport, The Netherlands; Tiszaujvaros, Hungary; Wuxi, China; Taoyuan City, Taiwan; and Singapore. These operations include materials procurement, commodity management, component engineering, test engineering, manufacturing engineering, product assembly, product assurance, quality control, final test, and global logistics. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials, as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems. We strive to have multiple suppliers qualified to provide critical components where possible and have our products manufactured in a number of locations to mitigate our supply chain risk. Our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers, maximizing the exchange of critical information and facilitating the implementation of joint quality programs. We use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies and final system configuration. This manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures while creating flexibility for rapid expansion.\n\n\nWe are certified to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 certification standards. We have been Tier 2 certified under the U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s (CBP) Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) program since January 2015.\n\n\nResearch and Development\n\n\nOur research and development team delivers innovation to help customers create an evolved cloud experience. Our R&D structure allows us to align and accelerate the execution of our strategies and roadmaps across product groups. We leverage our talent and shared IP for cloud- and hybrid-cloud solutions to remain agile to changing market conditions. Our R&D priorities are to help\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ncustomers break down silos to simplify management, create consistency, and deliver observability across on premises and multiple cloud environments. We design our products and services from the ground up with cloud connectivity in mind, including tiering, disaster recovery, replication, bursting, and migration.\n\n\nWe conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world. Total research and development expenses were $956 million in fiscal 2023, and $881 million in each of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. These costs consist primarily of personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product development activities. Although we develop many of our products internally, we also acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate. We believe that technical leadership is essential to our success, and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development.\n\n\nCompetition\n\n\nWe operate in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware, software, and related services offerings. Cloud, digital transformation, and artificial intelligence initiatives are driving changes in customer and solution requirements.\n\n\nWe compete with many companies in the markets we serve. Our hybrid cloud solutions primarily compete with legacy IT and storage vendors. Some offer a broad spectrum of products, solutions and services and others offer a more limited set of storage- and data-management products, solutions or services. Additionally, public cloud providers offer customers storage as an operating expense which competes with more traditional storage offerings that customers acquire through capital expenditures. We both partner with and compete against cloud providers with our public cloud software and services. We rarely see legacy vendors competing in the cloud.\n\n\nWe compete with many companies in the cloud operations marketplace, including new companies (startups) and larger software companies who target developers, operations engineering (DevOps) and financial engineering (FinOps). Some companies have single point solutions that compete with one of our services and others are building platforms. Additionally public cloud providers offer similar services on their own cloud.\n\n\nWe face ongoing product and price competition in all areas of our business, including from both branded- and generic-product competitors.\n \n\n\nOur current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including some of our partners. It is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and further increase competitive pressures.\n\n\nWe consider our software innovation, cloud integration, and technology partnerships key to our competitive differentiation. We believe our competitive advantage also includes the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and partners worldwide. We strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product, service, and support offerings, which enables us to provide our customers a full range of expertise before, during and after their purchases.\n\n\nProprietary Rights\n\n\nWe generally rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and contract laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology, products and services. While our intellectual property rights are important to our success, we believe that our business is not materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark, copyright, license or other individual intellectual property right. We have been granted, or own by assignment\n,\n well over two thousand U.S. patents, hundreds of pending U.S. patent applications, and many corresponding patents and patent applications in other countries. From time to time, we may make certain intellectual property available under an open source license. Our primary trademarks are NetApp and the NetApp design logo, which are registered trademarks in the U.S. and in many other countries.  In addition, we have trademarks and trademark registrations in the U.S. and other countries covering our various product or service names.\n\n\nWe generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, resellers, distributors, customers, and suppliers. In addition, through various licensing arrangements, we receive certain rights to the intellectual property of others. We expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure additional licensing arrangements in the future, as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions, to support continued development and sales of our products and services. Some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees. The amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors, including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments; offsetting considerations, if any; and the degree of use of the licensed technology.\n\n\nThe industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding intellectual property rights, and we may be exposed to various risks related to such claims or legal\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nproceedings. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n\nEnvironmental Disclosure\n\n\nWe are committed to the success of our customers and partners, to delivering value to our stockholders, and to positively affecting the communities where our employees work and live. We firmly believe that we can accomplish these objectives concurrently with our commitment to sound environmental management. We are committed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; efficient use of natural resources; and minimizing, relative to the growth of the Company, the environmental impacts from our operations, products, and services, as well as complying with laws and regulations related to these areas.\n \n\n\nWe voluntarily measure, monitor, and publicly report our scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 (partial) greenhouse gas emissions and water impacts to CDP, a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions and water impacts to customers and institutional investors. We continuously seek to optimize the energy efficiency of our buildings, labs, and data centers; and we have increased our use of renewable energy, especially at our facilities in Bangalore, India and Wichita, Kansas, both of which are powered almost exclusively by renewable energy.\n\n\nAt both the global and regional/state levels, various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate or report on the effects of climate change. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. However, it is often difficult to anticipate future regulations pertaining to environmental matters and to estimate their impacts on our operations. Based on current information, we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs. We are not currently subject to a cap-and-trade system or any other mitigation measures that could be material to our operations, nor are we aware of any such measures that will impact us in the near future. Additionally, we have implemented disaster recovery and business resiliency measures to mitigate the physical risks our facilities, business, and supply chain might face as a consequence of severe weather/climate-related phenomena such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, and other such natural occurrences.\n\n\nWe are subject to international, federal, state, and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment. Various international, federal, state, and local provisions regulate the use and discharge of certain hazardous materials used in the manufacture of our products. Failure to comply with environmental regulations in the future could cause us to incur substantial costs, subject us to business interruptions or cause customers to cease purchasing from us. We strive to comply with all applicable environmental laws. All of our products meet the applicable requirements of the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH); Energy Related Products (ErP); Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS); and China RoHS directives. We have a product take-back program and an e-waste scheme to comply with the EU directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations in India.\n\n\nWe have maintained an environmental management system since December 2004 that provides the framework for setting, monitoring, and continuously improving our environmental goals and objectives. As part of ISO 14001 requirements, we set local environmental performance goals, such as reducing energy use per square foot and minimizing waste generated on site, that are aligned with our overall corporate strategy. We also conduct periodic reviews and are subject to third-party audits of our operations, and we monitor environmental legislation and requirements to help make sure we are taking necessary measures to remain in compliance with applicable laws, not only in our operations but also for our products.\n\n\nHuman Capital\n\n\nWe take pride in, and believe our success depends on, attracting and retaining leading talent in the industry based on a culture-fit approach. From our inception, NetApp has worked to build a model company and has embraced a culture of openness and trust. Our employees are supported and encouraged to be innovative, and we communicate openly and transparently so that employees can focus on critical and impactful work that ties directly to our business strategy. We continue to invest in our global workforce to support diversity and inclusion and to support our employees\u2019 well-being and development.\n \n\n\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging\n\n\nWe believe diversity, inclusion and belonging leads to more innovation, better access to talent and improved business outcomes. Our strategies are intended to increase the demographic and cognitive diversity of our employee population, promote a culture of inclusion and to leverage such diversity to achieve business results. For more information about our commitment to diversity, inclusion and belonging, go to the \u201cDiversity Inclusion and Belonging\u201d section of our website.\n\n\nBenefits, Wellbeing and Engagement\n\n\nOur healthcare options offer competitive, comprehensive coverage for our employees and their families, including:\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nNational medical plans,\n\n\n\u2022\nRegional medical plans,\n\n\n\u2022\nExpert advice from world-renowned doctors through our medical second opinion program,\n\n\n\u2022\nNational dental plans,\n\n\n\u2022\nNational vision plans with two levels of coverage to choose from and a\n\n\n\u2022\nRobust wellness program.\n\n\nInsurance and income protection\n. We provide life, accidental death and dismemberment and disability insurance programs. For additional peace of mind, we also offer supplemental insurance for our employees and their dependents.\n\n\nFinancial and savings programs.\n We offer flexible spending accounts, an employee stock purchase plan and a competitive 401(k) retirement plan with a company match. Our 401(k) plan gives employees more options to maximize retirement savings with pre-tax, Roth and after-tax contributions. We help our employees prepare for retirement by capitalizing on their total compensation and helping them save.\n\n\nFlexible Work.\n We offer a flexible work program (Thrive Everywhere) that allows employees, in consultation with their managers and teams, flexibility around where, when and how work is performed to deliver business outcomes, understanding that certain roles may be tied to specific locations or require an in-office presence due to business needs and job responsibilities, while others may be primarily virtual.\n\n\nEmployee Wellbeing.\n We provide a wide range of wellbeing programs and tools to ensure employees and their families have the resources they need when they need them. We offer emotional wellbeing resources and programs such as back-up child and elder care, student debt repayment, educational assistance, and legal services for employees and their dependents. NetApp also offers a variety of time-off programs to help support our employees who need time-off. Employees also have access to discounts and fitness centers.\n\n\nEngagement. \nOur Thrive Everywhere program is designed to help employees grow, develop and succeed at NetApp by encouraging an open and interactive culture, where individual needs are recognized and met, and Company goals are supported. For employees, growth goals are tied to corporate objectives and key results to ensure that employees are progressing and are supported by management teams.  Managers are encouraged to set aside time each quarter to conduct a two-way conversation with each team member to offer feedback, guidance and support on goals, priorities and career development. The Company also conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like cross-functional collaboration, manager performance and inclusivity and create action plans to address concerns and amplify opportunities.\n \n\n\nGiving Back. \nThe NetApp Serves Program supports how our employees want to make a difference in the world. In 2022, more than 3,160 NetApp employees donated over 42,600 hours to serve their communities and make an impact around the world. The NetApp Serves Program encourages employees to volunteer through individual, team or company efforts.\n\n\nBoard Oversight of Human Capital Management\n\n\nOur Board of Directors plays an active role in overseeing the Company's human capital management strategy and programs. Our Talent and Compensation Committee provides oversight of our talent strategy and key programs related to corporate culture, workforce diversity and inclusion, talent acquisition, engagement, development and retention.\n \n\n\nEmployees\n\n\nAs of April 28, 2023, we had approximately 12,000 employees worldwide. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider relations with our employees to be good.\n \n\n\nPlease visit our website for more detailed information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives.

The following discussion reflects our current judgment regarding the most significant risks we face. These risks can and will change in the future.\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\n\nOur business may be harmed by technological trends in our market or if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry, technological and market changes.\n\n\nThe growth in our industry and the markets in which we compete is driven by the increase in demand for storage and data management solutions by consumers, enterprises and governments around the world, and the purchases of storage and data management solutions to address this demand. The rise in cloud usage and commensurate spending is driving customers to search for cloud operations solutions to lower costs and speed development. Despite these growth drivers, our markets could be adversely impacted by customers delaying purchases in the face of technology transitions, increasing adoption of substitute products and/or services, increased storage efficiency, and/or changing economic and business environments. For example, in fiscal 2023, we observed a slowdown in demand as a result of continuing global economic uncertainty. Additionally, customer requirements are evolving in the nascent cloud operations market, which could also adversely impact our opportunity. While customers are navigating through their information technology (IT) transformations, which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments, they are also looking for simpler solutions, and changing how they consume IT. This evolution is diverting spending towards transformational projects and architectures like flash, hybrid cloud, cloud storage, IT as a service, converged infrastructure, and software defined storage.\n \n\n\nOur business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry, technological or market changes or if our evolved cloud strategy is not accepted in the marketplace. As a result of these and other factors discussed in this report, our revenue may decline on a year-over-year basis, as it did in fiscal 2017 and 2020. The future impact of these trends on both short- and long-term growth patterns is uncertain. If the general historical rate of industry growth declines, if the growth rates of the specific markets in which we compete decline, and/or if the consumption model of storage changes and our new and existing products, services and solutions do not receive customer acceptance, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could suffer.\n \n\n\nIf we are unable to develop, introduce and gain market acceptance for new products and services while managing the transition from older ones, or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality and support for our new products and services, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed.\n\n\nOur future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and services. Due to the complexity of storage software, cloud operations software, subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products and services, such products and services are subject to significant technical and quality control risks.\n\n\nIf we are unable, for technological, customer reluctance or other reasons, to develop, introduce and gain market acceptance for new products and services, as and when required by the market and our customers, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n\nNew or additional product and feature introductions, including new software and cloud offerings, such as Astra by NetApp, cloud operations services including Spot by NetApp, Instaclustr and Cloud Insights, and new hardware and all-flash storage products, including AFF A900 and AFF C-series, subject us to additional financial and operational risks, including our ability to forecast customer preferences and/or demand, our ability to successfully manage the transition from older products and solutions, our ability to forecast and manage the impact of customers\u2019 demand for new products, services and solutions or the products being replaced, and our ability to manage production capacity to meet the demand for new products and services. In addition, as existing customers transition from older products and solutions to new software and cloud offerings, the transition could take longer than expected, or the customer could decide to delay the transition, either of which could result in non-renewal of the new offerings or affect our ability to manage and forecast customer churn and expansion rates for new software and cloud offerings, as we saw in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. As new or enhanced products and services are introduced, we must avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and related components and ensure that new products and services can be delivered to meet customers\u2019 demands. Further risks inherent in the introduction of new products, services and solutions include the uncertainty of price-performance relative to products of competitors, competitors\u2019 responses to the introductions, delays in sales caused by the desire of customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time and our partners\u2019 investment in selling our new products and solutions. If these risks are not managed effectively, we could experience material risks to our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs we enter new or emerging markets, we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition. We may not be able to provide products, services and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities.\n\n\nOur sales and distribution structure makes forecasting revenues difficult and, if disrupted, could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nOur business and sales models make revenues difficult to forecast. We sell to a variety of customers directly and through various channels, with a corresponding variety of sales cycles. The majority of our sales are made and/or fulfilled indirectly through channel partners, including value-added resellers, systems integrators, distributors, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and strategic business partners, which include public cloud providers. This structure significantly complicates our ability to forecast future revenue, especially within any particular fiscal quarter or year. Moreover, our relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic business partners are critical to our success. The loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area or the failure of our channel or strategic partners, including public cloud providers, to promote our products could harm our operating results. Qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically requires a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met. If we fail to maintain our relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic partners, including public cloud providers, if their financial condition, business or customer relationships were to weaken, if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements, or if we were to cease to do business with them for these or other reasons, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed.\n\n\nIncreasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nOur markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by fragmentation and rapidly changing technology. We compete with many companies in the markets we serve, including established public companies, newer public companies with a strong flash focus, and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for application data management for Kubernetes and cloud operations. Some offer a broad spectrum of IT products and services (full-stack vendors) and others offer a more limited set of products or services. Technology trends, such as hosted or public cloud storage, SaaS and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements. Cloud service provider competitors provide customers storage for their data centers on demand, without requiring a capital expenditure, which meets rapidly evolving business needs and has changed the competitive landscape. We also now compete in the emerging cloud operations market, where growth is being driven by increased customer cloud usage and commensurate spend, but customer requirements are still evolving. There is no clear leader in this market.\n \n\n\nCompetitors may develop new technologies, products or services in advance of us or establish new business models, more flexible contracting models or new technologies disruptive to us. By extending our flash, cloud storage, converged infrastructure and cloud operations offerings, we are competing in new segments with both traditional competitors and new competitors, particularly smaller emerging storage and cloud operations vendors. The longer-term potential and competitiveness of these emerging vendors remains to be determined. In cloud and converged infrastructure, we also compete with large well-established competitors.\n\n\nIt is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share or buying power. An increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as full-stack vendors for customers and achieve increased economies of scale in the supply chain. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including some of our partners or suppliers. For additional information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled \u201cCompetition\u201d contained in Part I, Item 1 \u2013 Business of this Form 10-K.\n\n\nGlobal economic and geopolitical conditions restrict our visibility and may harm our industry, business, and operating results, including our revenue growth and profitability, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nWe operate globally and as a result, our business, revenues and profitability are impacted by global economic and market conditions, including, among others, inflation, slower growth or recession, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, higher interest rates, tax rates, economic uncertainty, political instability, warfare, changes in laws, reduced consumer confidence and spending, and economic and trade barriers. Such factors may limit our ability to forecast future demand for our products and services, contribute to increased periodic volatility in the computer, storage and networking industries at large, as well as the IT market, impact availability of supplies and could constrain future access to capital for our suppliers, customers and partners. The impacts of these circumstances are global and pervasive, and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution of these matters remain highly uncertain. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including those identified above, could materially adversely impact the demand for our products and our operating results amid customer concerns over slowing demand for their products, reduced asset values, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses, local and state governments, and sovereign nations. For example, in fiscal 2023, global economic uncertainty had, and could continue to have, a material adverse impact on the demand for our products. Additionally, constraints in our supply chain in\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nfiscal 2023, including higher component and freight costs, resulted, and may continue to result, in increased costs of revenue and delays in fulfillment of certain customer orders. Consequently, these concerns have challenged our business and we expect them to continue to challenge our business for the foreseeable future. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\n\n\nTransition to consumption-based business models may adversely affect our revenues and profitability in other areas of our business and as a result may harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nWe offer customers a full range of consumption models, including the deployment of our software through our subscription and cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS), and utility pricing and managed services offerings for our hardware and software systems. These business models continue to evolve, and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our consumption-based offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our on-premise hardware and software offerings and could have a dampening impact on overall demand for our on-premise hardware and software product and service offerings, which could reduce our revenues and profitability, at least in the near term. If we do not successfully execute our consumption model strategy or anticipate the needs of our customers, our revenues and profitability could decline.\n\n\nAs customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases, we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional hardware and software license arrangements (for which revenue is generally recognized in full at the time of delivery), relative to our consumption model offerings (for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement). We incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructure and marketing of our consumption model offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings.\n\n\nDue to the global nature of our business, risks inherent in our international operations could materially harm our business.\n\n\nA significant portion of our operations are located, and a significant portion of our revenues are derived, outside of the U.S. In addition, most of our products are manufactured outside of the U.S., and we have research and development, sales and service centers overseas. Accordingly, our business and future operating results could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our international operations including, among other things, local political or economic conditions, trade protection and export and import requirements, tariffs, local labor conditions, transportation costs, government spending patterns, acts of terrorism, international conflicts and natural disasters in areas with limited infrastructure and adverse public health developments. In particular, ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China could impact our business and operating results. For products we manufacture in Mexico, tensions between the U.S. and Mexico related to trade and border security issues could delay our shipments to customers, or impact pricing or our business and operating results. As a result of Russia\u2019s actions in the Ukraine, numerous countries and organizations have imposed sanctions and export controls, while businesses, including the Company, have limited or suspended Russian operations. Russia has likewise imposed currency restrictions and regulations and may further take retaliatory trade or other actions, including the nationalization of foreign businesses. These actions could impact our supply chain, pricing, business and operating results and expose us to cyberattacks. In addition, due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products, including antitrust and anti-competition laws, and regulations related to data privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. We are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy, misappropriation, or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than U.S. laws. Such factors could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nWe face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. We utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies may not be successful, and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows. In addition, our foreign currency exposure on assets, liabilities and cash flows that we do not hedge could have a material impact on our financial results in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to foreign currencies.\n\n\nMoreover, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is a common business practice to engage in activities that are prohibited by NetApp's internal policies and procedures, or U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. There can be no assurance that all our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will comply with these policies, procedures, laws and/or regulations. Any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nOur acquisitions may not achieve expected benefits, and may increase our liabilities, disrupt our existing business and harm our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n   As part of our strategy, we seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products and services, expand the breadth of our markets, or enhance our technical capabilities. For example, we acquired eight privately held companies from fiscal 2020 through the end of fiscal 2023. The benefits we have received, and expect to receive, from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence, negotiate the terms of the acquisition and integrate the acquired business into our systems, procedures and organizational structure. Any inaccuracy in our acquisition assumptions or any failure to uncover or mitigate liabilities or risks associated with the acquisition, such as differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data privacy protection controls or contractual limitations of liability, and any failure to make the acquisition on favorable terms, integrate the acquired business or assets as and when expected, or retain key employees of the acquired company may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits of the acquisition to us, increase our costs, disrupt our operations, result in additional liabilities, investigations and litigation, and may also harm our strategy, our business and our operating results. The failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets.\n\n\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed.\n\n\nOur continued success depends, in part, on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and to advance our corporate strategy and preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture. Because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products and features, we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers, including in emerging areas of technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. In addition, to increase revenues, we will be required to increase the productivity of our sales force and support infrastructure to achieve adequate customer coverage. Competition for qualified employees, particularly in the technology industry, is intense. We have periodically reduced our workforce, including reductions of approximately 6% and 8% announced in fiscal 2021 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, respectively, and these actions may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees. Our inability to hire and retain qualified management and skilled personnel, particularly engineers, salespeople and key executive management, could disrupt our development efforts, sales results, business relationships and/or our ability to execute our business plan and strategy on a timely basis and could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nMany of our employees participate in our flexible work program (Thrive Everywhere), and work remotely on a full- or part-time basis. While Thrive Everywhere has been generally well received by employees, it may also create other challenges that impact our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including, but not limited to, some employees may prefer an in person work environment, decreased collaboration and communication among employees,  and reduced ability to maintain our corporate culture and workforce morale. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks and challenges associated with remote work, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.\n \n\n\nEquity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs as they support attraction and engagement of key talent and align employee interests with shareholders. A competitive broad-based equity compensation program is essential to compete for talent in both the hardware and software industries, in which competitors for talent provide a more significant portion of compensation via equity. If we reduce, modify or eliminate our equity programs or fail to grant equity competitively, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees.\n \n\n\nIn addition, because of the structure of our sales, cash and equity incentive compensation plans, we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times. For example, the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of periodic bonuses or the vesting of equity awards.\n\n\nWe often incur expenses before we receive related benefits, and expenses may be difficult to reduce quickly if demand declines.\n\n\nWe base our expense levels in part on future revenue expectations and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed. It is difficult to reduce our fixed costs quickly, and if revenue levels are below our expectations, operating results could be adversely impacted. During periods of uneven growth or decline, we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits, which could also harm our operating results. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in engineering, sales, service and support, marketing and other functions to support and grow our business. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits, such as revenue growth, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect, which could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nInitiatives intended to make our cost structure, business processes and systems more efficient may not achieve the expected benefits and could inadvertently have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nWe continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient, including by moving our business activities from higher-cost to lower-cost locations, outsourcing certain business processes and functions, and implementing changes to our business information systems. These efforts may involve a significant investment of financial and human resources and significant\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nchanges to our current operating processes. For example, in fiscal 2024, we are implementing certain business information systems. We may encounter difficulties in implementing new business information systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems and software. Such difficulties may lead to significant expenses or losses due to unexpected additional costs required to implement or maintain systems, disruption in business operations, loss of sales or profits, or disruption to our ability to timely and accurately process and report key aspects of our financial statements and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n\nIn addition, as we move operations into lower-cost jurisdictions and outsource certain business processes, we become subject to new regulatory regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations and, as a consequence, become more dependent upon the systems and business processes of third-parties. If we are unable to move our operations, outsource business processes or implement new business information systems in a manner that complies with local law and maintains adequate standards, controls and procedures, the quality of our products and services may suffer and we may be subject to increased litigation risk, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, we may not achieve the expected benefits of these and other transformational initiatives, which could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nWe are exposed to credit risks, our investment portfolio may experience fluctuations in market value or returns, and our cash and cash equivalents could be adversely affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and cash equivalents fail.\n \n\n\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of our investments and the returns thereon may fluctuate substantially. Unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, rising interest rates, or other circumstances could result in an economic slowdown and possibly cause a global recession. An economic slowdown or increased regional or global economic uncertainty may lead to failures of counterparties, including financial institutions, governments and insurers, which could result in a material decline in the value of our investment portfolio and substantially reduce our investment returns. We regularly maintain cash balances at large third-party financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limit of $250,000 and similar regulatory insurance limits outside the United States. If a depository institution where we maintain deposits fails or is subject to adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets, we may not be able to recover all of our deposits, which could adversely impact our operating liquidity and financial performance. Similarly, if our customers or partners experience liquidity issues as a result of financial institution defaults or non-performance where they hold cash assets, their ability to pay us may become impaired and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including the collection of accounts receivable and cash flows.\n\n\nOur goals and disclosures related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance.\n \n\n\nWe have established and publicly announced ESG goals, including our commitment to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and increasing our representation of women in our global workforce and underrepresented minorities in our US workforce. These statements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our failure to accomplish or accurately track and report on these goals on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our reputation, financial performance and growth, and expose us to increased scrutiny from our stakeholders, the investment community as well as enforcement authorities.\n\n\nOur ability to achieve any ESG objective is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control, including the changing regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures, our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent in our labor markets, the locations and usage of our products and the implications on their greenhouse gas emissions and the success of our organic growth and acquisitions.\n\n\nStandards for tracking and reporting ESG matters continue to evolve. Our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards, may change from time to time or differ from those of others. This may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period or between the Company and other companies in the same industry. In addition, our processes and controls may not always comply with evolving standards for identifying, measuring and reporting ESG metrics, including ESG-related disclosures that may be required of public companies by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future.\n\n\nIf our ESG practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner, acquiror or supplier could be negatively impacted. Further, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards on a timely basis, or at all, could have similar negative impacts or expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Customers and Sales\n\n\nA portion of our revenues is generated by large, recurring purchases from various customers, resellers and distributors. A loss, cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has negatively affected our revenues in the past, and could negatively affect our revenues in the future.\n\n\nA significant portion of our net revenues is generated through sales to a limited number of customers and distributors. We generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers, resellers and distributors for extended periods of time, and thus there is no guarantee we will continue to receive large, recurring orders from these customers, resellers or distributors. For example, our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases, and our customers, resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact the solvency of our customers, resellers and distributors or the ability of such customers, resellers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products. If any of our key customers, resellers or distributors changes its pricing practices, reduces the size or frequency of its orders for our products, or stops purchasing our products altogether, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.\n\n\nIf we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners, our revenues may be harmed.\n\n\nOur growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major third-party software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also co-market our products with them. A number of our strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments in which we do not directly participate. In particular, strategic partnerships with public cloud providers and other cloud service vendors are critical to the success of our cloud-based business. However, there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners, and these relationships may not be exclusive, may not generate significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice. For instance, some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors, which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners. Moreover, some of our partners, particularly large, more diversified technology companies, including major cloud providers, are also competitors, thereby complicating our relationships. If we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships, if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us, we could experience lower than expected revenues, suffer delays in product development, or experience other harm to our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nOur success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business in response to changing market conditions and market demand for our products, and such actions may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nOur ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning, forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions.\n\n\nWe recently reorganized our sales resources, which included changes and additions to our sales leadership team, to gain operational efficiencies and improve the alignment of our resources with customer and market opportunities. We expect to continue developing our sales organization and go-to-market model towards these goals throughout fiscal 2024. The reorganization of our sales resources, and ongoing evolution of our go-to-market model, could result in short or long-term disruption of our sales cycles, may not produce the efficiencies and benefits desired, and could harm our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n \n\n\nWe have and may in the future undertake initiatives that could include reorganizing our workforce, restructuring, disposing of, and/or otherwise discontinuing certain products, facility reductions or a combination of these actions. Rapid changes in the size, alignment or organization of our workforce, including our business unit structure, structure of our sales team, and sales account coverage, could adversely affect our ability to develop, sell and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives. Any decision to take these actions may result in charges to earnings associated with, among other things, inventory or other fixed, intangible or goodwill asset reductions (including, without limitation, impairment charges), workforce and facility reductions and penalties and claims from third-party resellers or users of discontinued products. Charges associated with these activities could harm our operating results. In addition to the costs associated with these activities, we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the underlying restructuring activities.\n\n\nReduced U.S. government demand could materially harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we could be harmed by claims that we have or a channel partner has failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the U.S. government.\n\n\nThe U.S. government is an important customer for us. However, government demand is uncertain, as it is subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints. Events such as the U.S. federal government shutdown from December 2018 to January 2019\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nand continued uncertainty regarding the U.S. budget and debt levels have increased demand uncertainty for our products. In addition, like other customers, the U.S. government may evaluate competing products and delay purchasing in the face of the technology transitions taking place in the storage industry. If the U.S. government or an individual agency or multiple agencies within the U.S. government continue to reduce or shift their IT spending patterns, our operating results, including revenues may be harmed.\n\n\nSelling our products to the U.S. government, whether directly or through channel partners, also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations, fines, and other penalties, which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. As an example, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the General Services Administration (GSA) have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with IT vendors, including us and several of our competitors and channel partners, under the False Claims Act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of GSA contracts for sales to the federal government. Although the DOJ and GSA currently have no claims pending against us, we could face claims in the future. Violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements, including with respect to cybersecurity or affirmative action program requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n \n\n\nIn response to increasing cybersecurity threats, the U.S. government has subjected IT vendors, including us, to certain additional requirements. As an example, the Executive Order on Improving the Nation\u2019s Cybersecurity (EO 14028), released in May 2021, outlines the U.S. government\u2019s plan to address software supply chain security for \u201ccritical software\u201d and other software. NetApp\u2019s products are categorized as critical software, requiring us to achieve compliance with the Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) under NIST special publication 800-218. The current deadline for compliance is subject to the U.S. government\u2019s finalization of their common attestation form, and any products that cannot attest to compliance with the SSDF may result in delays or inability to execute contracts with customers, particularly with government entities.\n\n\nIf we do not achieve forecasted sales orders in any quarter, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed.\n\n\nWe derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter. Orders typically follow intra-quarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter. If we do not achieve the level, timing and mix of orders consistent with our quarterly targets and historical patterns, or if we experience cancellations of significant orders, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed.\n\n\nOur gross margins may vary.\n\n\nOur gross margins reflect a variety of factors, including competitive pricing, component and product design, and the volume and relative mix of revenues from product, software support, hardware support and other services offerings. Increased component costs, increased pricing and discounting pressures, the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product prices, or changes in the mix of revenue or decreased volume from product, software support, hardware support and other services offerings could harm our revenues, gross margins or earnings. Our gross margins are also impacted by the cost of any materials that are of poor quality and our sales and distribution activities, including, without limitation, pricing actions, rebates, sales initiatives and discount levels, and the timing of service contract renewals.\n\n\nThe costs of third-party components comprise a significant portion of our product costs. While we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs, we may have difficulty managing these costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase. Any such limitation could result in an increase in our product costs. An increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could harm our gross margins and earnings.\n\n\nWe are exposed to the credit and non-payment risk of our customers, resellers and distributors, especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets, which could result in material losses.\n\n\nMost of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days. We may experience increased losses as potentially more customers are unable to pay all or a portion of their obligations to us, particularly in the current macroeconomic environment when access to sources of liquidity may be limited. Beyond our open credit arrangements, some of our customers have entered into recourse and non-recourse financing leasing arrangements using third-party leasing companies. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default. During periods of economic uncertainty, our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases. In addition, our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions.\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Products and Services\n\n\nAny disruption to our supply chain could materially harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not manufacture certain components used in our products. We rely on third parties to manufacture critical components, as well as for associated logistics. Our lack of direct responsibility for, and control over, these elements of our business, as well as the diverse international geographic locations of our manufacturing partners and suppliers, creates significant risks for us, including, among other things:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nLimited number of suppliers for certain components; \n\n\n\u2022\nNo guarantees of supply and limited ability to control the quality, quantity and cost of our products or of their components; \n\n\n\u2022\nThe potential for binding price or purchase commitments with our suppliers at higher than market rates; \n\n\n\u2022\nLimited ability to adjust production volumes in response to our customers\u2019 demand fluctuations; \n\n\n\u2022\nLabor and political unrest at facilities we do not operate or own; \n\n\n\u2022\nGeopolitical disputes disrupting our supply chain; \n\n\n\u2022\nImpacts on our supply chain from adverse public health developments, including outbreaks of contagious diseases such as COVID-19; \n\n\n\u2022\nBusiness, legal compliance, litigation and financial concerns affecting our suppliers or their ability to manufacture and ship components in the quantities, quality and manner we require; and \n\n\n\u2022\nDisruptions due to floods, earthquakes, storms and other natural disasters, especially those caused by climate change, and particularly in countries with limited infrastructure and disaster recovery resources.\n\n\nSuch risks have subjected us, and could in the future subject us, to supply constraints, price increases and minimum purchase requirements and our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed. For example, the global shortage of critical product components in fiscal 2023 caused us to experience increased prices and extended lead times for certain critical components, such as semiconductors. Such shortages could reduce our flexibility to react to product mix changes and disrupt our production schedule. The risks associated with our outsourced manufacturing model are particularly acute when we transition products to new facilities or manufacturers, introduce and increase volumes of new products or qualify new contract manufacturers or suppliers, at which times our ability to manage the relationships among us, our manufacturing partners and our component suppliers, becomes critical. New manufacturers, products, components or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers. Any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality, quantity or delivery requirements in a cost-effective manner will harm our business, including customer relationships and as a result could harm our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components.\n\n\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components utilized in the assembly of our products, including certain single source suppliers, which has subjected us, and could in the future subject us, to price rigidity, periodic supply constraints, and the inability to produce our products with the quality and in the quantities demanded. Consolidation among suppliers, particularly within the semiconductor and storage media industries, has contributed to price volatility and supply constraints. When industry supply is constrained, or the supply chain is disrupted, as it was during the COVID-19 pandemic, our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors, all of which rely on many of the same suppliers as we do. Accordingly, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows may be harmed.\n\n\nIf a material cybersecurity or other security breach impacts our services or occurs on our systems, within our supply chain, or on our end-user customer systems, or if stored data is improperly accessed, customers may reduce or cease using our solutions, our reputation may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities.\n \n\n\nWe store and transmit, and sell products and services that store and transmit, personal, sensitive and proprietary data related to our products, our employees, customers, clients and partners (including third-party vendors such as data centers and providers of SaaS, cloud computing, and internet infrastructure and bandwidth), and their respective customers, including intellectual property, books of record and personal information. It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure, products and services remain secure and are perceived by customers, clients and partners to be secure. There are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, human error and technological vulnerabilities. Material cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches could result in (1) unauthorized access to, or loss or unauthorized use, alteration, or disclosure of, such information; (2) litigation, indemnity obligations, government investigations and proceedings, and other possible liabilities; (3) negative publicity; and (4) disruptions to our internal and external operations. Any of these could damage our reputation\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nand public perception of the security and reliability of our products, as well as harm our business and cause us to incur significant liabilities. In addition, a material cybersecurity incident or loss of personal information, or other material security breach could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs and lost revenues.\n\n\nOur clients and customers use our platforms for the transmission and storage of sensitive data. We do not generally review the information or content that our clients and their customers upload and store, and we have no direct control over the substance of the information or content stored within our platforms. If our employees, or our clients, partners or their respective customers use our platforms for the transmission or storage of personal or other sensitive information, or our supply chain cybersecurity is compromised and our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, stolen or fraudulently obtained log-in credentials or otherwise, our reputation could be damaged, our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liabilities.\n\n\nSecurity industry experts and US Government officials continue to emphasize risks to our industry. Cyber attacks and security breaches continue to increase, and of particular concern are supply-chain attacks against software development. We anticipate that cyberattacks will continue to increase in the future. We cannot give assurance that we will always be successful in preventing or repelling unauthorized access to our systems. We also may face delays in our ability to identify or otherwise respond to any cybersecurity incident or any other breach. Additionally, we use third-party service providers to provide some services to us that involve the storage or transmission of data, such as SaaS, cloud computing, and internet infrastructure and bandwidth, and they face various cybersecurity threats and also may suffer cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches.\n \n\n\nMany jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting laws requiring companies to notify regulators or individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding security incidents often lead to widespread negative publicity. Moreover, the risk of reputational harm may be magnified and/or distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet, including through news articles, blogs, social media, and other online communication forums and services. Any security incident, loss of data, or other security breach, whether actual or perceived, or whether impacting us or our third-party service providers, could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to elect not to renew their support contracts or their SaaS subscriptions, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\n\nThere can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. Our existing general liability insurance coverage, cybersecurity insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nIf a data center or other third-party who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data, such disruption could be attributed to the quality of our products, thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business.\n\n\nOur clients, including data centers, SaaS, cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers, rely on our products for their data storage needs. Our clients may authorize third-party technology providers to access their data on our systems. Because we do not control the transmissions between our clients, their customers, and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Errors or wrongdoing by clients, their customers, or third-party technology providers resulting in actual or perceived security breaches may result in such actual or perceived breaches being attributed to us.\n\n\nA failure or inability to meet our clients\u2019 expectations with respect to security and confidentiality through a disruption in the services provided by these third-party vendors, or the loss or alteration of data stored by such vendors, could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by, or perceived by our customers to have been caused by, defects in our products. Moreover, the risk of reputational harm may be magnified and/or distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet, including through news articles, blogs, social media, and other online communication forums and services. This may affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business.\n\n\n Failure to comply with new and existing laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security could cause harm to our reputation, result in liability and adversely impact our business.\n\n\n \nOur business is subject to increasing regulation by various federal, state and international governmental agencies responsible for enacting and enforcing laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security. For example, since the\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\neffective date of the EU\u2019s General Data Privacy Regulation in 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union has issued rulings that have impacted how multinational companies must implement that law and the European Commission (EC) has published new regulatory requirements relating to cross-border data transfers applicable to multinational companies like NetApp. NetApp relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of European Economic Area (EEA) individuals to other countries, including Binding Corporate Rules and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). In June 2021, the EC imposed new SCC requirements which impose certain contract and operational requirements on NetApp and its contracting parties, including requirements related to government access transparency, enhanced data subject rights, and broader third-party assessments to ensure safeguards necessary to protect personal data transferred from NetApp or its partners to countries outside the EEA, requiring NetApp to revise customer and vendor agreements. In addition to the EU\u2019s General Data Privacy Regulation, other global governments have adopted new privacy and data protection laws.  In particular, the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the EU has resulted in a parallel comprehensive privacy law known as the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation, which is similarly supplemented by other domestic data protection laws, such as the United Kingdom Data Protection Act 2018.\n\n\n The rapidly evolving regulatory framework in this area is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.  In addition, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations could impact our business operations and those of our partners, vendors and customers. Customers, privacy advocates and industry groups also may propose new and different self-regulatory standards or standards of care that may legally or contractually apply to us, and these standards may be subject to change. These factors create uncertainty and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards, or changes to such laws, regulations, or standards, or to their interpretation or enforcement, may have on our business or the businesses of our partners, vendors and customers. In addition, changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations could impact our business operations and those of our partners, vendors and customers.\n\n\n Because the interpretation and application of many laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, along with industry standards, are uncertain, it is possible that relevant laws, regulations, or standards may be interpreted and applied in manners that are, or are alleged to be, inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our products. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us or our business partners to comply with federal, state or international laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, commitments relating to privacy, data protection, and information security contained in our contracts, self-regulatory standards that apply to us or that third parties assert are applicable to us, or our policies or notices we post or make available could subject us to claims, investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions and other proceedings, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal liability, penalties or injunctions.\n \n\n\nAdditionally, as a technology provider, our customers expect that we can demonstrate compliance with laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, and our inability or perceived inability to do so may adversely impact sales of our products and services, particularly to customers in highly-regulated industries. We have invested company resources in complying with new laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, and we may be required to make additional, significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenue and our business overall. As a result of any inability to comply with such laws and regulations, our reputation and brand may be harmed, we could incur significant costs, and financial and operating results could be materially adversely affected, and we could be required to modify or change our products or our business practices, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Our business could be subject to stricter obligations, greater fines and private causes of action, including class actions, under the enactment of new laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, including but not limited to, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which provides for penalties of up to 20 million Euros or four percent of our annual global revenues, UK General Data Protection Regulation, which provides for penalties up to 15 million Pounds or four percent of our annual global revenue, the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act, and other U.S. state-based regulation.\n\n\nIf our products or services are defective, or are perceived to be defective as a result of improper use or maintenance, our operating results, including gross margins, and customer relationships may be harmed.\n\n\nOur products and services are complex. We have experienced in the past, and expect to experience in the future, quality issues impacting certain products, and in the future, we could experience reliability issues with services we provide. Such quality and reliability issues may be due to, for example, our own designs or processes, the designs or processes of our suppliers, and/or flaws in third-party software used in our products. These types of risks are most acute when we are introducing new products. Quality or reliability issues have and could again in the future cause customers to experience outages or disruptions in service, data loss or data corruption. If we fail to remedy a product defect or flaw, we may experience a failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, loss of revenue, inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and higher ongoing warranty and service costs, and these occurrences could have a material impact on our gross margins, business and operating results. In addition, we exercise little control over how our customers use or maintain our products and services, and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products and services, which could lead to a perception of a quality or reliability issue. Customers may experience losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects or flaws in our products and services, which could subject us to claims for damages, including consequential damages.\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChanges in regulations relating to our products or their components, or the manufacture, sourcing, distribution or use thereof, may harm our business, operating results financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nThe laws and regulations governing the manufacturing, sourcing, distribution and use of our products have become more complex and stringent over time. For example, in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions, the use and discharge of hazardous materials and the use of certain minerals originating from identified conflict zones, many governments, including the U.S., the United Kingdom and Australia, have adopted regulations concerning the risk of human trafficking in supply chains which govern how workers are recruited and managed. We incur costs to comply with the requirements of such laws. Further, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell or the actions of our suppliers with respect to workers. As the laws and regulations governing our products continue to expand and change, our costs are likely to rise, and the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could subject us to business interruptions, litigation risks and reputational harm.\n\n\nSome of our products are subject to U.S. export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold, distributed, or delivered, and any violation of these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nDue to the global nature of our business, we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The U.S., through the BIS and OFAC, places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons, including most recently to Russia, Belarus and portions of Ukraine. These regulations have caused the Company to stop selling or servicing our products temporarily in restricted areas, such as Russia, Belarus and portions of Ukraine. The BIS and OFAC have also placed restrictions on dealing with certain \"blocked\u201d entities, such as Russia\u2019s federal security service (FSB), including the Company\u2019s filing of notifications to the FSB for exporting certain products to Russia. Violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties, which may include significant monetary fines, criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees, a denial of export privileges, and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government. Our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties, including potentially our channel partners, despite our precautions.\n\n\nIf we were ever found to have violated U.S. export control laws, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Even if we were not found to have violated such laws, the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm. Such collateral consequences could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nOur success depends significantly upon developing, maintaining and protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees, resellers, strategic partners and customers, to protect our proprietary rights. We currently have multiple U.S. and international patent applications pending and multiple U.S. and international patents issued. The pending applications may not be approved, and our existing and future patents may be challenged. If such challenges are brought, the patents may be invalidated. We may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable, and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties. Further, the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business. In addition, a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology. Any such litigation may be time-consuming and costly. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the U.S. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products, or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours. In addition, while we train employees in confidentiality practices and include terms in our employee and consultant agreements to protect our intellectual property, there is persistent risk that some individuals will improperly take our intellectual property after terminating their employment or other engagements with us, which could lead to intellectual property leakage to competitors and a loss of our competitive advantages.\n\n\nWe may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others.\n\n\nWe compete in markets in which intellectual property infringement claims arise in the normal course of business. Third parties have, from time to time, asserted intellectual property-related claims against us, including claims for alleged patent infringement brought by non-practicing entities. Such claims may be made against our products and services, our customers\u2019 use of our products\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nand services, or a combination of our products and third-party products. We also may be subject to claims and indemnification obligations from customers and resellers with respect to third-party intellectual property rights pursuant to our agreements with them. If we refuse to indemnify or defend such claims, even in situations in which the third-party\u2019s allegations are meritless, then customers and resellers may refuse to do business with us.\n \n\n\nPatent litigation is particularly common in our industry. We have been, and continue to be, in active patent litigations with non-practicing entities. While we vigorously defend our ability to compete in the marketplace, there is no guarantee that, in patent or other types of intellectual property litigation, we will prevail at trial or be able to settle at a reasonable cost.  If a judge or jury were to find that our products infringe, we could be required to pay significant monetary damages and be subject to an injunction that could cause product shipment delays, require us to redesign our products, affect our ability to supply or service our customers, and/or require us to enter into compulsory royalty or licensing agreements.\n \n\n\nWe expect that companies in the enterprise storage and data management, cloud storage and cloud operations markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any such claims, and any such infringement claims discussed above, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause suspension of product shipments or product shipment delays, require us to redesign our products, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n \n\n\nWe rely on software from third parties, and a failure to properly manage our use of third-party software could result in increased costs or loss of revenue.\n \n\n\nMany of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties. Such third-party software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and software licensed under public open source licenses. We have internal processes to manage our use of such third-party software. However, if we fail to adequately manage our use of third-party software, then we may be subject to copyright infringement or other third-party claims. If we are non-compliant with a license for commercial software, then we may be required to pay penalties or undergo costly audits pursuant to the license agreement. In the case of open-source software licensed under certain \u201ccopyleft\u201d licenses, the license itself may require, or a court-imposed remedy for non-compliant use of the open source software may require, that proprietary portions of our own software be publicly disclosed or licensed. This could result in a loss of intellectual property rights, increased costs, damage to our reputation and/or a loss of revenue.\n\n\nIn addition, many of our products use open-source software. Such open-source software generally does not provide any warranty or contractual protection, and may be susceptible to attack from bad actors. Further, open-source software may contain vulnerabilities, which may or may not be known at the time of our inclusion of the software in a product. If a vulnerability in such software is successfully exploited, we could be subject to damages including remediation costs, reputational damage and lost revenues.\n \n\n\nOur failure to adjust to emerging standards may harm our business.\n\n\nEmerging standards may adversely affect the UNIX\n\u00ae\n, Windows\n\u00ae\n and World Wide Web server markets upon which we depend. For example, we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services, healthcare, pharmaceutical and government market segments, industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access, reliability and permanence in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate. If our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard, customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products, and we may not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted.\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Securities\n\n\nOur stock price is subject to volatility.\n\n\nOur stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors' or analysts' valuation measures for our stock, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt, changes in our credit ratings, our ability to pay dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned and market trends unrelated to our performance.\n \n\n\nOur ability to pay quarterly dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned will be subject to, among other things, our financial condition and operating results, available cash and cash flows in the U.S., capital requirements, and other factors. Future dividends are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors, and our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. However, if we fail to meet any investor expectations related to dividends and/or stock repurchases, the market price of our stock could decline significantly, and could have a material adverse impact on investor\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nconfidence. Additionally, price volatility of our stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock\u2019s market price at a given point in time.\n\n\nFurthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations or business can cause changes in our stock price. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products or services, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us, and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes may adversely affect our stock price.\n\n\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially, which could harm our common stock price.\n\n\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so, sometimes materially. All of the matters discussed in this Risk Factors section could impact our operating results in any fiscal quarter or year. In addition to those matters, we face the following issues, which could impact our quarterly results:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nSeasonality, such as our historical seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year and seasonal increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year;\n\n\n\u2022\nLinearity, such as our historical intra-quarter customer orders and revenue pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter\u2019s total orders and related revenue occur in the last month of the quarter; and\n\n\n\u2022\nUnpredictability associated with larger scale enterprise software license agreements which generally take longer to negotiate and occur less consistently than other types of contracts, and for which revenue attributable to the software license component is typically recognized in full upon delivery.\n\n\nIf our operating results fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the trading price of our common stock may decline.\n \n\n\nThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness.\n\n\nAs of April 28, 2023, we had $2.4 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness for our senior notes that mature at specific dates in calendar years 2024, 2025, 2027 and 2030. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future under existing credit facilities and/or enter into new financing arrangements. We may fail to pay these or additional future obligations, as and when required. Specifically, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service or refinance our debt, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows will be harmed. Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moody\u2019s Investors Service or Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services may adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the terms of such financing and reduce the market capacity for our commercial paper. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon any potential future financing, then interest expense related to the refinance indebtedness would increase.\n \n\n\nIn addition, all our debt and credit facility arrangements subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants. If we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements. Moreover, compliance with these covenants may restrict our strategic or operational flexibility in the future, which could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGeneral Risks\n \n\n\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters, terrorist acts or other catastrophic events.\n\n\nWe depend on the ability of our personnel, inventories, equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world. Any political, military, terrorism, global trade, world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions. For example, in recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic impeded the mobility of our personnel, inventories, equipment and products and disrupted our business operations. Furthermore, any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters, including fires, floods, droughts, hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanoes; power loss or shortages; environmental disasters; telecommunications or business information systems failures or break-ins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business. As a result of climate change, we expect the frequency and impact of such natural disasters or other material disruptions to increase. If such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on IT, or directly impact our marketing, manufacturing, financial and logistics functions, or impair our ability to meet our customer demands, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our headquarters is located in Northern California, an area susceptible to earthquakes and wildfires. If any significant disaster were to occur there, our ability to operate our business and our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.\n \n\n\nOur effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include among other things, fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries and states in which we do business, changes to the tax laws in such jurisdictions and the outcome of income tax audits. Changes to any of these factors could materially impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n \n\n\nWe receive significant tax benefits from sales to our non-U.S. customers. These benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and in the countries in which our international operations are located. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations or a change in how we manage our international operations could adversely affect our ability to continue realizing these tax benefits.\n \n\n\nMany countries around the world are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and related action plans that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules and nexus-based tax incentive practices. As a result, many of these changes, if enacted, could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n \n\n\nOur effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations and interpretations of such laws and regulations, which in turn would negatively impact our earnings and cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain. Additionally, our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations, our tax structure and how our operations are managed and structured, and as a result, we could experience harm to our operating results and financial condition. For example, on August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes a corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases. We continue to evaluate the impacts of changes in tax laws and regulations on our business.\n \n\n\nWe are routinely subject to income tax audits in the U.S. and several foreign tax jurisdictions. If the ultimate determination of income taxes or at-source withholding taxes assessed under these audits results in amounts in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt\nem 1B.  \nUnresolved Staff Comments\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nItem 2.  \nP\nroperties\n\n\nWe owned or leased, domestically and internationally, the following properties as of April 28, 2023.\n\n\nWe own approximately 0.8 million square feet of facilities in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina.

The following discussion also contains trend information and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A. \u2013 Risk Factors are hereby incorporated into the discussion by reference.\n\n\nExecutive Overview\n\n\nOur Company\n \n\n\nNetApp is a global cloud-led, data-centric software company that empowers customers with hybrid multicloud solutions built for a better future. Building on more than three decades of innovation, we give customers the freedom to manage applications and data across hybrid multicloud environments. NetApp delivers value in simplicity, security, savings, and sustainability with automation and optimization for IT teams to thrive on premises, in the clouds, and everywhere in between. We are a proven leader in all-flash storage with the only storage OS natively available on the biggest clouds, and we believe we provide industry-leading protection and security, and innovative CloudOps services.\n \n\n\nIn a world of hybrid multicloud complexity, we envision a better IT experience\u2014an evolved cloud state where on-premises and cloud environments are united as one. We build solutions that drive faster innovation wherever our customers\u2019 data and applications live, with unified management and AI-driven optimization, giving organizations the freedom to do what\u2019s best for today\u2019s business and the flexibility to adapt for tomorrow. Our infrastructure, data, and application services are hybrid multicloud by design to deliver a unified experience that is integrated with the rich services of our cloud partners.\n \n\n\nOur operations are organized into two segments: Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud.\n\n\nHybrid Cloud \noffers a portfolio of storage management and infrastructure solutions that help customers recast their traditional data centers into modern data centers with the power of the cloud. Our hybrid cloud portfolio is designed to operate with public clouds to unlock the potential of hybrid, multi-cloud operations. We offer a broad portfolio of cloud-connected all-flash, hybrid-flash, and object storage systems, powered by intelligent data management software. Hybrid Cloud is composed of software, hardware, and related support, as well as professional and other services.\n\n\nPublic Cloud \noffers a portfolio of products delivered primarily as-a-service, including related support. This portfolio includes cloud storage and data services and cloud operations services. Our enterprise-class solutions and services enable customers to control and manage storage in the cloud, consume high-performance storage services for primary workloads, and optimize cloud environments for cost and efficiency. These solutions and services are generally available on the leading public clouds, including Amazon AWS\n, \nMicrosoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.\n\n\nGlobal Business Environment\n\n\nMacroeconomic Conditions\n\n\nContinuing global economic uncertainty, political conditions and fiscal challenges in the U.S. and abroad have resulted and may continue to result in adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates, foreign exchange volatility, slower growth and possibly a recession. In particular, in fiscal 2023, we experienced a weakened demand environment, characterized by cloud optimizations and increased budget scrutiny, which resulted in smaller deal sizes, longer selling cycles, and delays of some deals.\n\n\nIf these macroeconomic uncertainties persist or worsen in fiscal 2024, we may observe a further reduction in customer demand for our offerings, which could impact our operating results.\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSupply Chain\n\n\nSupply chain constraints, particularly in the first half of fiscal 2023, led to higher product component and freight costs in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Supply chain constraints also delayed our ability to fulfill certain customer orders during the first half of fiscal 2023.\n\n\nFinancial Results and Key Performance Metrics Overview\n\n\nThe following table provides an overview of key financial metrics for each of the last three fiscal years (in millions, except per share amounts and percentages):\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 30, 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet revenues\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n6,362\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n6,318\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n5,744\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross profit\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,209\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,220\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,815\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross profit margin percentage\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n66\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n67\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n66\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome from operations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,018\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,157\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,031\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome from operations as a percentage of net revenues\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n16\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(208\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n158\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n232\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,274\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n937\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n730\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiluted net income per share\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n5.79\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4.09\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n3.23\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,107\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,211\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,333\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28,\n\u00a02023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29,\n\u00a02022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,313\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,232\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nNet revenues\n: Our net revenues increased approximately 1% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, due to an increase in services revenues, primarily driven by an increase in public cloud revenues.\n\n\n\u2022\nGross profit margin percentage:\n Our gross profit margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased less than one percentage point in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to the decrease in gross profit margins on product revenues.\n\n\n\u2022\nIncome from operations as a percentage of net revenues:\n Our income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased by two percentage points in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to a slightly lower gross profit margin percentage and an increase in restructuring charges.\n\n\n\u2022\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes:\n We had a benefit from income taxes in fiscal 2023, compared to a provision for income taxes in fiscal 2022, due to a discrete tax benefit of $524 million that resulted from an intra-entity asset transfer of certain intellectual property.\n\n\n\u2022\nNet income and Diluted net income per share:\n The increase in both net income and diluted net income per share in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 reflect the factors discussed above. Higher net income and increased share repurchases in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 favorably impacted diluted net income per share.\n\n\nStock Repurchase Program and Dividend Activity\n\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, we repurchased approximately 13 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $66.42 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $850 million. We also declared aggregate cash dividends of $2.00 per share in fiscal 2023, for which we paid a total of $432 million.\n\n\nAcquisition\n\n\nOn May 20, 2022, we acquired all the outstanding shares of privately-held Instaclustr US Holding, Inc. (Instaclustr), a leading platform provider of fully managed open-source database, pipeline and workflow applications delivered as a service, for approximately $498 million.\n\n\nRestructuring Events\n\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, we executed several restructuring plans and recognized expenses totaling $120 million consisting primarily of employee severance-related costs.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResults of Operations\n\n\nOur fiscal year is reported on a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last Friday in April. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal months with calendar months. Fiscal 2023, which ended on April 28, 2023, and fiscal 2022, which ended on April 29, 2022 were both 52-week years. Fiscal 2021, which ended on April 30, 2021 was a 53-week year, with 14 weeks included in its first quarter and 13 weeks in each subsequent quarter.

\n\n\nThe increase in net revenues for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was due to an increase in services revenue partially offset by a decrease in product revenues. Product revenues as a percentage of net revenues decreased by approximately four percentage points in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, while services revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased by approximately four percentage points. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacted net revenues percent growth by approximately four percentage points in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\n\n\nThe increase in net revenues for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was due to an increase in both product revenues and services revenues, with revenues increasing despite the additional week in fiscal 2021. Product revenues and services revenues as a percentage of net revenues both remained relatively consistent in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.\n\n\nSales through our indirect channels represented 78%, 77% and 77% of net revenues in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n\nThe following customers, each of which is a distributor, accounted for 10% or more of net revenues:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFiscal Year\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrow Electronics, Inc.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n24\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n24\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n24\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech Data Corporation\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n21\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n21\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n20\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Revenues (in millions, except percentages):\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFiscal Year\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n% Change\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n% Change\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct revenues\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,049\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,284\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(7\n\n\n)%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,991\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware (Non-GAAP)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,251\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,358\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(8\n\n\n)%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,355\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware (Non-GAAP)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,798\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,926\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(7\n\n\n)%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,636\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHybrid Cloud\n\n\nProduct revenues are derived through the sale of our Hybrid Cloud solutions and consist of sales of configured all-flash array systems (including All-Flash FAS and QLC-Flash FAS) and hybrid systems, which are bundled hardware and software products, as well as add-on flash, disk and/or hybrid storage and related OS, StorageGrid, OEM products, NetApp HCI and add-on optional software.\n\n\nIn order to provide visibility into the value created by our software innovation and R&D investment, we disclose the software and hardware components of our product revenues. Software product revenues includes the OS software and optional add-on software solutions attached to our systems across our entire product set, while hardware product revenues include the non-software component of our systems across the entire set. Because our revenue recognition policy under GAAP defines a configured storage system, inclusive of the operating system software essential to its functionality, as a single performance obligation, the hardware and software components of our product revenues are considered non-GAAP measures. The hardware and software components of our product revenues are derived from an estimated fair value allocation of the transaction price of our contracts with customers, down to the level of the product hardware and software components. This allocation is primarily based on the contractual prices at which NetApp has historically billed customers for such respective components.\n \n\n\nTotal product revenues decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to lower sales of all flash array systems, as a result of softening customer demand. Product revenues were also unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of hybrid systems.\n\n\nTotal product revenues increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily driven by an increase in sales of all-flash array systems and, to a lesser extent, an increase in sales of StorageGrid, partially offset by a decrease in sales of NetApp HCI. Supply chain challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic impeded our ability to fulfill certain customer orders in fiscal 2022, particularly in the fourth quarter.\n\n\nRevenues from the hardware component of product revenues represented 41%, 41% and 45% of product revenues in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The software component of product revenues represented 59%, 59% and 55% of product revenues in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The software component percentage of product revenues remained relatively flat in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 despite the decrease in sales of all-flash array systems, which contain a higher proportion of software components than other Hybrid Cloud products, primarily due to the mix of other Hybrid Cloud products sold. The increase in the software component percentage of product revenues in fiscal 2022 is primarily due to a higher mix of all-flash array systems sales.\n\n\nServices Revenues (in millions, except percentages):\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFiscal Year\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n% Change\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n% Change\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices revenues\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,313\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,034\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,753\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,419\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,344\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,277\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional and other services\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n319\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n294\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n277\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic cloud\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n575\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n396\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n45\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n199\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n99\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHybrid Cloud\n \n\n\nHybrid Cloud services revenues are derived from the sale of: (1) support, which includes both hardware and software support contracts (the latter of which entitle customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements, bug fixes and patch releases), and (2) professional and other services, which include customer education and training.\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSupport revenues increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, despite the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, primarily due to a higher aggregate support contract value for our installed base in the current year.\n \n\n\nSupport revenues increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, despite an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 that contributed approximately $40 million of additional revenues in that period, primarily due to a higher aggregate support contract value for our installed base in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.\n\n\nProfessional and other services revenues increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to an increase in other services revenues.

The transaction resulted in a step-up of tax-deductible basis in the transferred assets, and accordingly, created a temporary difference where the tax basis exceeded the financial statement basis of such intangible assets, which resulted in the recognition of a discrete tax benefit and related deferred tax asset of $524 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Management applied significant judgment when determining the fair value of the IP, which serves as the tax basis of the deferred tax asset. With the assistance of third-party valuation specialists, the fair value of the IP was determined principally based on the present value of projected cash flows related to the IP which reflects management\u2019s assumptions regarding projected revenues, earnings before interest and taxes, and a discount rate. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights will be recognized in future periods and any amortization that is unused in a particular year can be carried forward indefinitely. The deferred tax asset and the tax benefit were measured based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years the asset is expected to be realized. We expect to realize the deferred tax asset resulting from the IP Transfer and will assess the realizability of the deferred tax asset quarterly. Any Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (\u201cOECD\u201d) actions adopted internationally could impact our financial results in future periods. The impact of the transaction to net cash provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows during fiscal 2023 was not material.\n\n\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Danish Supreme Court issued a non-appealable ruling on the distributions declared in 2005 and 2006. The Danish Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision and ruled the 2005 dividend was subject to at-source dividend withholding tax while the smaller 2006 distribution would not be subject to withholding tax. We recorded $69 million of tax expense, which includes $23 million of withholding tax (which we paid in fiscal 2023) and $46 million of interest (which is included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet as of the end of fiscal 2023), associated with the Danish Supreme Court ruling as a discrete item during the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n \n\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was lower than the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of one-time benefits related to the prepayment of certain intercompany expenses. Additionally, the fiscal 2021 tax provision included the impact of taxes resulting from the integration of certain acquired companies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Requirements\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In millions, except percentages)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28,\n\u00a02023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29,\n\u00a02022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,070\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,134\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrincipal amount of debt\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,400\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,650\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following is a summary of our cash flow activities:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFiscal Year\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,107\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,211\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1,390\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(561\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used in financing activities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1,513\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1,017\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(49\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(1,797\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(416\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of April 28, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $3.1 billion, reflecting a decrease of $1.1 billion from April 29, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to $850 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, $432 million used for the payment of dividends, $239 million in purchases of property and equipment, a $250 million repayment of our Senior Notes due December 2022, and $491 million, net of cash acquired, used for the acquisition of a privately-held company, partially offset by $1.1 billion of cash from operating activities. Net working capital was $1.2 billion as of April 28, 2023, a reduction of $779 million when compared to April 29, 2022, primarily due to the decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments discussed above.\n\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, we generated cash from operating activities of $1.1 billion, reflecting net income of $1.3 billion which was reduced by $606 million for non-cash deferred tax benefits and increased for non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $248 million and non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $312 million.\n\n\nSignificant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2023 included the following:\n\n\n\u2022\nAccounts receivable \ndecreased $260 million, reflecting lower billing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\n\n\n\u2022\nAccounts payable \ndecreased by $207 million, primarily reflecting lower inventory purchases, and the timing of those purchases from, and payments to, our contract manufacturers.\n\n\n\u2022\nAccrued expenses \ndecreased by $103 million, primarily due to employee compensation payments related to fiscal 2022 incentive compensation and commissions plans.\n\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we generated cash from operating activities of $1.2 billion, reflecting net income of $937 million, adjusted by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $194 million and non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $245 million.\n\n\nSignificant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2022 included the following:\n\n\n\u2022\nAccounts receivable \nincreased $313 million, primarily reflecting less favorable shipping linearity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\n\n\u2022\nDeferred revenue and financed unearned services \nincreased by $384 million, due to an increase in the aggregate contract value under software and hardware support contracts, primarily reflecting a higher mix of all-flash systems which carry a higher support dollar content than our other products.\n\n\n\u2022\nAccounts payable \nincreased by $181 million, primarily due to higher inventory purchase levels in fiscal 2022, and the timing of inventory purchases during the fourth quarter of each year.\n\n\n\u2022\nAccrued expenses \ndecreased by $111 million, primarily reflecting a reduction of income tax liabilities, and a decrease in accruals for incentive compensation and commissions plans.\n\n\nWe expect that cash provided by operating activities may materially fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, shipping linearity, accounts receivable collections performance, inventory and supply chain management, vendor payment initiatives, and the timing and amount of compensation, income taxes and other payments.\n\n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, we used $719 million for the purchases of investments, net of maturities and sales, paid $491 million, net of cash acquired, for a privately-held company and $239 million for capital expenditures. Additionally, we received proceeds of $59 million from the sale of one of our minority investments in fiscal 2023.\n\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we generated $45 million primarily from maturities of investments in available-for-sale securities, net of purchases, and paid $226 million for capital expenditures. We paid $380 million, net of cash acquired, for three privately-held companies.\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, cash flows used in financing activities totaled $1.5 billion and include $850 million for the repurchase of approximately 13 million shares of common stock, $432 million for the payment of dividends and $250 million to redeem our Senior Notes due in December 2022.\n\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, cash flows used in financing activities totaled $1.0 billion and included $600 million for the repurchase of approximately seven million shares of common stock and $446 million for the payment of dividends.\n\n\nKey factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability, our ability to effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories, the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, our ability to effectively integrate acquired products, businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt. Based on past performance and our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and our ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements. We cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all. For further discussion of factors that could affect our cash flows and liquidity requirements, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n \n\n\nLiquidity\n\n\nOur principal sources of liquidity as of April 28, 2023 consisted of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash we expect to generate from operations, and our commercial paper program and related credit facility.\n\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28,\n\u00a02023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29,\n\u00a02022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,316\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,112\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort-term investments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n754\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n22\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,070\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,134\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of April 28, 2023 and April 29, 2022, $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by various foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings, while $0.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, were available in the U.S.\n\n\nOur principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, fund research and development, meet capital expenditure needs, invest in critical or complementary technologies through asset purchases and/or business acquisitions, service interest and principal payments on our debt, fund our stock repurchase program, and pay dividends, as and if declared. In the ordinary course of business, we engage in periodic reviews of opportunities to invest in or acquire companies or units in companies to expand our total addressable market, leverage technological synergies and establish new streams of revenue, particularly in our Public Cloud segment.\n\n\nThe principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity. We attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high-quality investment grade securities, limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counter-parties and underlying obligors closely. We believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible. We are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of April 28, 2023.\n\n\nOur investment portfolio has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets. We continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio. We routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We may in the future offer an additional unspecified amount of debt, equity and other securities.\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSenior Notes\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the principal amount of our Senior Notes as of April 28, 2023 (in millions):\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAmount\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.30% Senior Notes Due September 2024\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n400\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.875% Senior Notes Due June 2025\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n750\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.375% Senior Notes Due June 2027\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n550\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.70% Senior Notes Due June 2030\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n700\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,400\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInterest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually. For further information on the underlying terms, see Note 8 \u2013 Financing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\nOn September 15, 2022, we extinguished our 3.25% Senior Notes due December 2022 for an aggregate cash redemption price of $252 million, comprised of the principal and unpaid interest.\n\n\nCommercial Paper Program and Credit Facility\n\n\nWe have a commercial paper program (the Program), under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes. Amounts available under the Program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed $1.0 billion. The maturities of the notes can vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes are used for general corporate purposes. No commercial paper notes were outstanding as of April 28, 2023.\n\n\nIn connection with the Program, we have a senior unsecured credit agreement with a syndicated group of lenders. The credit agreement, \nwhich was amended in May 2023 primarily to replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the basis for establishing the interest rate applicable to certain borrowings under the agreement\n, provides for a $1.0 billion revolving unsecured credit facility, with a sublimit of $50 million available for the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf. The credit facility matures on January 22, 2026, with an option for us to extend the maturity date for two additional 1-year periods, subject to certain conditions. The proceeds of the loans may be used by us for general corporate purposes and as liquidity support for our existing commercial paper program. As of April 28, 2023, we were compliant with all associated covenants in the agreement.  No amounts were drawn against this credit facility during any of the periods presented.\n\n\nCapital Expenditure Requirements\n\n\nWe expect to fund our capital expenditures, including our commitments related to facilities, equipment, operating leases and internal-use software development projects over the next few years through existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors, including future demand for products, changes in the network storage industry, hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements. We anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 to be between $175 million and $225 million.\n\n\nTransition Tax Payments\n\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 imposed a mandatory, one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits that had not previously been subject to U.S. income tax. As of April 28, 2023, outstanding payments related to the transition tax are estimated to be approximately $303 million of which $88 million, $115 million and $100 million are expected to be paid during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026, respectively. During fiscal 2023, transition tax payments totaled $48 million. Our estimates for future transition tax payments, however, could change with further guidance or review from U.S. federal and state tax authorities or other regulatory bodies.\n\n\nDividends and Stock Repurchase Program\n\n\nOn May 26, 2023, we declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock, payable on July 26, 2023 to holders of record as of the close of business on July 7, 2023.\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of April 28, 2023, our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $15.1 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. Under this program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Since the May 13, 2003 inception of this program through April 28, 2023, we repurchased a total of 360 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $40.89 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $14.7 billion. As of April 28, 2023, the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was $0.4 billion. On May 26, 2023 our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $1.0 billion of our common stock.\n \n\n\nPurchase Commitments\n\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to third-party contract manufacturers and component suppliers to manage manufacturer lead times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties, to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have open purchase orders and contractual obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not yet received goods or services. These off-balance sheet purchase commitments totaled $0.7\n \nbillion at April 28, 2023, of which $0.5 billion is due in fiscal 2024, with the remainder due thereafter.\n\n\nFinancing Guarantees\n\n\nWhile most of our arrangements for sales include short-term payment terms, from time to time we provide long-term financing to creditworthy customers. We have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts\u2019 dates of execution, and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as \u201ctrue sales\u201d as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We sold $38 million and $59 million of receivables during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n\nIn addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products. These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user.\n \n\n\nSome of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through third-party financing institutions. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default. These arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. As of April 28, 2023 and April 29, 2022, the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant. To date, we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements.\n\n\nWe have entered into service contracts with certain of our end-user customers that are supported by third-party financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of our non-performance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid payments under such arrangements. As of April 28, 2023, we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements, and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote. The portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our consolidated balance sheets\n.\n \n\n\nLegal Contingencies\n\n\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business. See further details on such matters in Note 17 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\n\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), which require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. The accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n\nOur contracts with customers often include the transfer of multiple products and services to the customer. In determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition, we assess which products and services are distinct performance obligations and allocate the transaction price, which may include fixed and/or variable amounts, among each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties included in this approach:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKey Estimates and Assumptions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKey Uncertainties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nWe evaluate whether products and services promised in our contracts with customers are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nIn certain contracts, the determination of our distinct performance obligations requires significant judgment. As our business and offerings to customers change over time, the products and services we determine to be distinct performance obligations may change. Such changes may adversely impact the amount of revenue and gross margin we report in a particular period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nIn determining the transaction price of our contracts, we estimate variable consideration based on the expected value, primarily relying on our history. In certain situations, we may also use the most likely amount as the basis of our estimate.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nWe may have insufficient relevant historical data or other information to arrive at an accurate estimate of variable consideration using either the \u201cexpected value\u201d or \u201cmost likely amount\u201d method. Additionally, changes in business practices, such as those related to sales returns or marketing programs,   may introduce new forms of variable consideration, as well as more complexity and uncertainty in the estimation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nIn contracts with multiple performance obligations, we establish SSPs based on the price at which products and services are sold separately. If SSPs are not observable through past transactions, we estimate them by maximizing the use of observable inputs including pricing strategy, market data, internally-approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations and other observable inputs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nAs our business and offerings evolve over time, modifications to our pricing and discounting methodologies, changes in the scope and nature of product and service offerings and/or changes in customer segmentation may result in a lack of consistency, making it difficult to establish and/or maintain SSPs. Changes in SSPs could result in different and unanticipated allocations of revenue in contracts with multiple performance obligations. These factors, among others, may adversely impact the amount of revenue and gross margin we report in a particular period.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInventory Valuation and Purchase Order Accruals\n\n\nInventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. A provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKey Estimates and Assumptions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKey Uncertainties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nWe periodically perform an excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory. Inventories are written down based on excess and obsolete reserves determined primarily on assumptions about future demand forecasts and market conditions. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nAlthough we use our best estimates to forecast future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand, including due to macroeconomic uncertainties, or obsolescence related to technological developments, new product introductions, customer requirements, competition or other factors could have a significant impact on the valuation of our inventory.

If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may realize higher gross profits in the period when the written-down inventory is sold.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the manufacture of our products. If there are changes to the current regulations, we may be required to make product design changes which may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could adversely impact our operating results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nWe make commitments to our third-party contract manufacturers and other suppliers to manage lead times and meet product forecasts and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. We establish accruals for estimated losses on non-cancelable purchase commitments when we believe it is probable that the components will not be utilized in future operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nIf the actual materials demand is significantly lower than our forecast, we may be required to increase our recorded liabilities for estimated losses on non-cancelable purchase commitments, including incremental commitments made in response to recent developments in the broader technology supply chain, which would adversely impact our operating results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\n\n\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values based on established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\n\nThe carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. We periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets. This review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives, resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of income.\n\n\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of one of our reporting units may exceed its fair value. The provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. For our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we performed a quantitative test and determined the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying amount, therefore, there was no impairment of goodwill.\n \n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKey Estimates and Assumptions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKey Uncertainties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nThe assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.\nThe valuation of purchased intangible assets is principally based on estimates of the future performance and cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets from the acquired business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nWhile we employ experts to determine the acquisition date fair value of acquired intangibles, the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on significant management assumptions and estimates, which are inherently uncertain and highly subjective and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. If different assumptions were to be used, it could materially impact the purchase price allocation. Volatile macroeconomic and market conditions have increased the level of uncertainty and subjectivity of certain management assumptions and estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nEvaluations of possible goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment require us to make judgments and assumptions related to the allocation of our balance sheet and income statement amounts and estimate future cash flows and fair market values of our reporting units and assets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nIn response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or purchased intangible assets.\n \nAssumptions and estimates about expected future cash flows and the fair values of our reporting units and purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as the adverse impact of unanticipated changes in macroeconomic conditions, and technological changes or new product introductions from competitors. They can also be affected by internal factors such as changes in business strategy or in forecasted product life cycles and roadmaps. Our ongoing consideration of these and other factors could result in future impairment charges or accelerated amortization expense, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\n\n\nThe following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our income taxes, including those specifically related to the intra-entity asset transfer of the IP to our international headquarters during fiscal 2023:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKey Estimates and Assumptions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKey Uncertainties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nOur income tax provision is based on existing tax law and advanced pricing agreements or letter rulings we have with various tax authorities.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by future changes in existing tax laws, such as a change in tax rate, possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, and uncertainties as to future renewals of favorable tax agreements and rulings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nThe determination of whether we should record or adjust a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is based on assumptions regarding our future profitability.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nOur future profits could differ from current expectations resulting in a change to our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.

Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome or tax court rulings of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nThe assessment of the fair value of the IP transferred to our international headquarters is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets and transfer pricing principles from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n \nThe valuation of our IP is principally based on the present value of projected cash flows related to the IP which reflects management\u2019s assumptions regarding projected revenues, earnings before interest and taxes, and a discount rate.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\nWhile we employ experts to assist with the determination of the fair value of IP, its fair value is based on significant management assumptions and estimates, which are inherently uncertain and highly subjective, and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. If different assumptions were to be used, it could materially impact the IP valuation. Volatile macroeconomic and market conditions have increased the level of uncertainty and subjectivity of certain management assumptions and estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt\nem 7A.  \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\n\nWe are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All financial instruments are used in accordance with management-approved policies.\n\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\n\nFixed Income Investments\n \u2014 As of April 28, 2023, we had fixed income debt investments of $754 million and certificates of deposit of $59 million. Our fixed income debt investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase, which are classified as available-for-sale investments. These fixed income debt investments, which consist primarily of corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury and government debt securities, and our certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates from levels as of April 28, 2023 would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-income securities of approximately $2 million. Volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.\n \n\n\nOur investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities. We further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer. We actively review, along with our investment advisors, current investment ratings, company-specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary. We monitor and evaluate our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for any other-than-temporary impairments.\n\n\nDebt\n \u2014 As of April 28, 2023 we have outstanding $2.4 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount and issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. Since these instruments\n \n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nbear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 8 \u2013 Financing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n\n\nCredit Facility\n \u2014 We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates in connection with our $1.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the facility accrue interest at rates that vary based on certain market rates and our credit rating on our Senior Notes. Consequently, our interest expense would fluctuate with any changes in these market interest rates or in our credit rating if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility. As of April 28, 2023, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility.\n\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n\n\nWe hedge risks associated with certain foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings. We utilize foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge against the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. We also use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures related to forecasted sales transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. These derivatives are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging.\n\n\nWe do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes. In entering into foreign currency exchange forward contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign currency exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks. All contracts have a maturity of 12 months or less. See Note 11 \u2013 Derivatives and Hedging Activities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our derivatives and hedging activities.\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt\nem 8.  \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\n\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\n\n

INC.\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\n FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1. Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\n \u2014 NetApp, Inc. (we, us, or the Company) is a global cloud-led, data-centric software company that provides organizations the ability to manage and share their data across on-premises, private and public clouds. We provide a full range of enterprise-class software, systems and services solutions that customers use to modernize their infrastructures, build next generation data centers and harness the power of hybrid clouds.\nFiscal Year\n \u2014 Our fiscal year is reported on a 52- or 53-week year ending on the last Friday in April. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal months with calendar months. Fiscal 2023, which ended on April 28, 2023, and fiscal 2022, which ended on April 29, 2022 were both 52-week years. Fiscal 2021, ending on April 30, 2021 was a 53-week year, with 14 weeks included in its first quarter and 13 weeks in each subsequent quarter. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended on the last Friday of April and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years\n.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n \u2014 The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\n \nUse of Estimates\n \u2014 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, reserves and allowances; inventory valuation; valuation of goodwill and intangibles; restructuring reserves; employee benefit accruals; stock-based compensation; loss contingencies; investment impairments; income taxes and fair value measurements. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates, the anticipated effects of which have been incorporated, as applicable, into management\u2019s estimates as of and for the year ended April 28, 2023.\nCash Equivalents\n \u2014 We consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nAvailable-for-Sale Investments\n \u2014 We classify our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale investments. Debt securities primarily consist of corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury and government debt securities and certificates of deposit. These investments are primarily held in the custody of a major financial institution. A specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis of debt securities sold. These investments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.\nUnrealized gains and temporary losses, net of related taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). Upon realization, those amounts are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments are included in our results of operations. Realized gains and losses are calculated based on the specific identification method.\nWe classify our investments as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nOther-than-Temporary Impairments on Investments\n \u2014 All of our available-for-sale investments are subject to periodic impairment review. When the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, it is deemed impaired, and we assess whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. An impairment is considered other-than-temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If impairment is considered other-than-temporary based on condition (i) or (ii) described above, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the debt security is recognized in the results of operations. If an impairment is considered other-than-temporary based on condition (iii) described above, the amount representing credit losses (defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security) is recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI).\n58\n\n\n\u00a0\nInventories\n \u2014 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We write down excess and obsolete inventory based on the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value. Net realizable value is estimated using management\u2019s best estimate of forecasts for future demand and expectations regarding market conditions. At the point of a loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established basis. In addition, we record a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of excess and obsolete inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\n \u2014 Property and equipment are recorded at cost.\n \nDepreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method, generally over the following periods:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDepreciation Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuildings and improvements\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10\n\u00a0to \n40 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurniture and fixtures\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5\n\u00a0years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer, production, engineering and other equipment\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2\n\u00a0to \n3 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer software\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3\n\u00a0to \n5 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeasehold improvements\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShorter of remaining lease term or useful life\n\n\n\n\n \nConstruction in progress will be depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets when they are ready for use. We capitalize interest on significant facility assets under construction and on significant software development projects. Interest capitalized during the periods presented was not material.\nSoftware Development Costs\n \u2014 The costs for the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in accordance with the accounting guidance for software. Because our current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility, which occurs upon the completion of a working model, no costs have been capitalized for any of the periods presented.\nInternal-Use Software Development Costs\n \u2014 We capitalize qualifying costs, which are incurred during the application development stage, for computer software developed or obtained for internal-use and amortize them over the software\u2019s estimated useful life.\nBusiness Combinations\n \u2014 We recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values, with the exception of contract assets and liabilities, which beginning in fiscal 2022, we recognize in accordance with our revenue recognition policy as if we had originally executed the customer contract. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income.\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\n \u2014 Goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic lives of\n three\n to \nfive years\n for developed technology, \ntwo\n to \nfive years\n for customer contracts/relationships, \ntwo\n to \nthree years\n for covenants not to compete and \ntwo\n to \nfive years\n for trademarks and trade names as we believe this method most closely reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be consumed. In-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset and is assessed for potential impairment annually until development is complete or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be impaired. Upon completion of development, in-process research and development is accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset.\nThe carrying value of goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. Triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization. For the purpose of impairment testing, we have two reporting units, which are the same as our two reportable segments. We initially conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The performance of the quantitative impairment test requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is based on a combination of the income approach and the market approach.\n \n59\n\n\n\u00a0\nUnder the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on discrete forecast periods as well as terminal value determinations, and are derived based on forecasted revenue growth rates and operating margins. These cash flow projections are discounted to arrive at the fair value of each reporting unit. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital of comparable public companies adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit. \nAn impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount. The impairment loss is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, with the recognized loss not to exceed the total amount of allocated goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit has substantially exceeded its carrying amount in all periods presented.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n \u2014 We review the carrying values of long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances, such as reductions in demand, lower projections of profitability, significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets, or significant negative industry or economic trends, indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. If this review indicates that there is an impairment, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value, which is typically calculated using: (i) quoted market prices and/or (ii) expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate. Our estimates regarding future anticipated cash flows, the remaining economic life of the products and technologies, or both, may differ materially from actual cash flows and remaining economic life. In that event, impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long-lived assets may be required, resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of income when such determinations are made.\nDerivative Instruments\n \u2014 Our derivative instruments, which are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, consist of foreign currency exchange contracts as described below:\nBalance Sheet Hedges\n \u2014 We utilize foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany receivables and payables. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset the gains and losses in the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged, and the net amount is included in earnings.\nCash Flow Hedges\n \u2014 We utilize foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange exposures related to forecasted sales transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and, in general, closely match the underlying forecasted transactions in duration. The effective portion of the contracts\u2019 gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value is recorded in AOCI until the forecasted transaction is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. When the forecasted transactions occur, we reclassify the related gains or losses on the cash flow hedges into net revenues. If the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it becomes probable that they will not occur within the defined hedge period, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI and recognized immediately in earnings. We measure the effectiveness of hedges of forecasted transactions on a monthly basis by comparing the fair values of the designated foreign currency exchange forward purchase contracts with the fair values of the forecasted transactions.\nFactors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging programs include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets. These programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. Currently, we do not enter into any foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments. Cash flows from our derivative programs are included under operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\n \u2014 We recognize revenue by applying the following five step approach.\n\u2022\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer \u2014\n A contract with a customer is within the scope of ASC 606 when it meets all the following criteria:\n-\nIt is enforceable\n-\nIt defines each party\u2019s rights\n-\nIt identifies the payment terms\n-\nIt has commercial substance, and\n-\nWe determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods or services that will be transferred is probable based on the customer\u2019s intent and ability to pay \n\u00a0\n60\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract \n\u2014 Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services (or a bundle of goods and services) that will be transferred to the customer that are distinct. \n\u00a0\n\u2022\nDetermination of the transaction price\n \n\u2014 The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. \n\u00a0\n\u2022\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n \n\u2014 Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation.\n\u2022\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation\n \n\u2014 We satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time.\nCustomarily we have a purchase order from or executed contract with our customers that establishes the goods and services to be transferred and the consideration to be received.\n \nWe combine two or more contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same customer as a single contract if the contracts are negotiated as one package with a single commercial objective, if the amount of consideration to be paid on one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract or if the goods and services promised in each of the contracts are a single performance obligation.\nOur contracts with customers may include hardware systems, software licenses, software support, hardware support, public cloud services and other services. Software support contracts entitle our customers to receive unspecified upgrades and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis, and patch releases. Hardware support services include contracts for extended warranty and technical support with minimum response times. Other services include professional services and customer education and training services.\n \nWe identify performance obligations in our contracts to be those goods and services that are distinct. A good or service is distinct where the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and is distinct in the context of the contract, where the transfer of the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\n \nIf a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, we apply judgment to determine whether promised goods or services are distinct. If they are not, we combine the goods and services until we have a distinct performance obligation. For example, a configured storage system inclusive of the operating system (OS) software essential to its functionality is considered a single performance obligation, while optional add-on software is a separate performance obligation. In general, hardware support, software support, and different types of professional services are each separate performance obligations.\nWe determine the transaction price of our contracts with customers based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services. Consideration promised may include fixed amounts, variable amounts or both. We sell public cloud services either on a subscription basis or a consumption basis. We sell professional services either on a time and materials basis or under fixed price projects.\nWe evaluate variable consideration in arrangements with contract terms such as rights of return, potential penalties and acceptance clauses. We generally use the expected value method, primarily relying on our history, to estimate variable consideration. However, when we believe it to provide a better estimate, we use the most likely amount method. In either case, we consider variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Reassessments of our variable consideration may occur as historical information changes. Transaction prices are also adjusted for the effects of time value of money if the timing of payments provides either the customer or us a significant benefit of financing.\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price by maximizing the use of observable inputs including pricing strategy, market data, internally-approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations and other observable inputs. We regularly review standalone selling prices and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates. Variable consideration is also allocated to the performance obligations. If the terms of variable consideration relate to one performance obligation, it is entirely allocated to that obligation. Otherwise, it is allocated to all the performance obligations in the contract.\nWe \ntypically recognize revenue at a point in time upon the transfer of goods to a customer. Products we transfer at a point in time include our configured hardware systems, OS software licenses, optional add-on software licenses and add-on hardware. Services are typically transferred over time and revenue is recognized based on an appropriate method for measuring our progress toward\n \n61\n\n\n\u00a0\ncompletion \nof the performance obligation. Our stand-ready services, including both hardware and software support, are transferred ratably over the period of the contract. Our public cloud services are transferred either 1) for subscription arrangements, ratably over the subscription period or 2) for consumption-based arrangements, as actually consumed by the customer. For other services such as our fixed professional services contracts, we use an input method to determine the percentage of completion. That is, we estimate the effort to date versus the expected effort required over the life of the contract. \n \nDeferred Commissions \n\u2014\n \nWe capitalize sales commissions that are incremental direct costs of obtaining customer contracts for which revenue is not immediately recognized and classify them as current or non-current based on the terms of the related contracts. Capitalized commissions are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which they relate, typically over \none\n to \nthree years\n, and are also periodically reviewed for impairment. Amortization expense is recorded to sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of income.\nLeases\n \u2014 We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception, and we classify leases as operating or finance leases at commencement. In our consolidated balance sheets, operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets are included in other non-current assets, while finance lease ROU assets are included in property and equipment, net. Lease liabilities for both types of leases are included in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over that term.\n \n\u00a0\nOperating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets also include any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and exclude lease incentives. The lease term is the noncancelable period of the lease and includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that an option will be exercised. As the rate implicit in our leases is typically not readily determinable, in computing the present value of lease payments we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are expensed as incurred and not included within the calculation of ROU assets and lease liabilities. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nWe do not separate non-lease components from lease components for any class of leases, and we do not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a lease term of twelve months or less.\nForeign Currency Translation\n \u2014 For international subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency, gains and losses resulting from translation of these foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in AOCI. For international subsidiaries where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, gains and losses resulting from the process of remeasuring foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in other (expense) income, net.\nBenefit Plans\n \u2014 We record actuarial gains and losses associated with defined benefit plans within AOCI and amortize net gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the market value of plan assets or the plans' projected benefit obligation on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated service life of plan participants. The measurement date for all defined benefit plans is our fiscal year end.\nStock-Based Compensation\n \u2014 We measure and recognize stock-based compensation for all stock-based awards, including employee stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), including time-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs (PBRSUs), and rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), based on their estimated fair value, and recognize the costs in our financial statements using the straight-line attribution approach over the requisite service period for the entire award.\nThe fair value of employee time-based RSUs, and PBRSUs that include a performance condition, is equal to the market value of our common stock on the grant date of the award, less the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period, discounted at a risk-free interest rate. The fair value of PBRSUs that include a market condition is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant.\nThe fair value of time-based RSUs, and PBRSUs that include a market condition, is not remeasured as a result of subsequent stock price fluctuations. When there is a change in management\u2019s estimate of expected achievement relative to the performance target for PBRSUs that include a performance condition, such as our achievement against a billings result average target, the change in estimate results in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment of stock-based compensation expense.\nOur expected term assumption is based primarily on historical exercise and post-vesting forfeiture experience. Our stock price volatility assumption is based on a combination of our historical and implied volatility. The risk-free interest rates are based upon United States (U.S.) Treasury bills with equivalent expected terms, and the expected dividends are based on our history and expected dividend payouts.\nWe account for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur.\n \n62\n\n\n\u00a0\nIncome Taxes\n \u2014 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are provided for temporary differences that will result in tax deductions or income in future periods, as well as the future benefit of tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance reduces tax assets to their estimated realizable value.\n \nWe recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. Estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes line on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nNet Income per Share\n \u2014 Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share is computed giving effect to the weighted-average number of dilutive potential shares that were outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Potential dilutive common shares consist primarily of outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under our employee stock purchase plan and unvested RSUs.\nTreasury Stock\n \u2014 We account for treasury stock under the cost method. Upon the retirement of treasury stock, we allocate the value of treasury shares between common stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.\n\n\n2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nAlthough there are new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable, we do not believe any of these accounting pronouncements had or will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, operating results, cash flows or disclosures.\n\n\n3. Concentration of Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, investments, foreign currency exchange contracts and accounts receivable. We maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents with several major financial institutions where the deposits exceed federally insured limits. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of money market funds, U.S. Treasury and government debt securities and certificates of deposit, all of which are considered high investment grade. Our policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities. We further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer. General macroeconomic uncertainty has led to an increase in market volatility, however, management believes that the financial institutions that hold our cash, cash equivalents and investments are financially sound and, accordingly, are subject to minimal credit risk.\nBy entering into foreign currency exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The counterparties to these contracts are major multinational commercial banks, and we do not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.\nWe sell our products primarily to large organizations in different industries and geographies. We do not require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. In addition, we maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. To reduce credit risk, we perform ongoing credit evaluations on our customers\u2019 financial condition. We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other information, including the expected impact of macroeconomic disruptions, and, to date, such losses have been within management\u2019s expectations. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the wide variety of customers who are dispersed across many geographic regions.\nThere are no concentrations of business transacted with a particular market that would severely impact our business in the near term. However, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain key components and a few key contract manufacturers to manufacture most of our products; any disruption, or termination of these arrangements could materially adversely affect our operating results.\n\n\n4.

We determined the estimated values with the assistance of valuations and appraisals performed by third party specialists and estimates made by management. We expect to realize revenue synergies and anticipate opportunities for growth through the ability to leverage additional future products and capabilities. These factors, among others, contributed to a purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of its identifiable net assets acquired, and as a result, we have recorded goodwill in connection with the acquisition. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\n \nThe results of operations related to the acquisition of Instaclustr have been included in our consolidated statements of income from the acquisition date.

Deferred services revenue represents customer payments made in advance for services, which include software and hardware support contracts, certain public cloud services and other services. Financed unearned services revenue represents undelivered services for which cash has been received under certain third-party financing arrangements. See Note 17 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information related to these arrangements.\nDuring the years ended April 28, 2023 and April 29, 2022, we recognized revenue of $\n2,171\n million and $\n2,062\n million, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue balance at the beginning of the respective periods.\n \n As of April 28, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations related to customer contracts that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied approximated our deferred revenue and unearned services revenue balance. Because customer orders are typically placed on an as-needed basis, and cancellable without penalty prior to shipment, orders in backlog may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue and have not been included in this amount. We expect to recognize as revenue approximately \n51\n% of our deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue balance in the next \n12\n months, approximately \n24\n% in the next 13 to 24 months, and the remainder thereafter.\n \nDeferred commissions\n \n The following table summarizes deferred commissions balances as reported in our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther current assets\n\n\n$\n\n\n64\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n80\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther non-current assets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n99\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n117\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal deferred commissions\n\n\n$\n\n\n163\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n197\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDuring the years ended April 28, 2023 and April 29, 2022, we recognized amortization expense from deferred commissions of $\n116\n million and $\n146\n million, respectively, and there were \nno\n impairment charges recognized.\nOther income (expense), net (in millions):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 30, 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n69\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n7\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n9\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n67\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n73\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n74\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther, net\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n46\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n4\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther income (expense), net\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n48\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n62\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n69\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nOther, net for fiscal 2023 includes $\n22\n million of other income for non-refundable, up-front payments from customers in Russia for support contracts, which we were not able to fulfill due to imposed sanctions and for which we have no remaining legal obligation to perform.

Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\nThe accounting guidance for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby the inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the three levels of inputs to measure fair value:\nLevel 1\n: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2:\n Inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in less active markets; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3:\n Unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to measure fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nWe consider an active market to be one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, and consider an inactive market to be one in which there are infrequent or few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers. Where appropriate, our own or the counterparty\u2019s non-performance risk is considered in measuring the fair values of liabilities and assets, respectively.\nInvestments\nThe following is a summary of our investments at their cost or amortized cost for the years ended April 28, 2023 and April 29, 2022 (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate bonds\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n9\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Treasury and government debt securities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n754\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney market funds\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n794\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,166\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertificates of deposit\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n59\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n71\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutual funds\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n36\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n36\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal debt and equity securities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,643\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,295\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \nThe fair value of our investments approximates their cost or amortized cost for both periods presented.

debt instruments are held by a custodian who prices some of the investments using standard inputs in various asset price models or obtains investment prices from third-party pricing providers that incorporate standard inputs in various asset price models. These pricing providers utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs like market transactions involving identical or comparable securities. We review Level 2 inputs and fair value for reasonableness and the values may be further validated by comparison to multiple independent pricing sources. In addition, we review third-party pricing provider models, key inputs and assumptions and understand the pricing processes at our third-party providers in determining the overall reasonableness of the fair value of our Level 2 debt instruments. As of April 28, 2023 and April 29, 2022, we have not made any adjustments to the prices obtained from our third-party pricing providers.\nFair Value of Debt\nAs of April 28, 2023 and April 29, 2022, the fair value of our long-term debt was approximately $\n2,206\n million and $\n2,491\n million, respectively. The fair value of our long-term debt was based on observable market prices in a less active market.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the Senior Notes under specified terms. The Senior Notes also include covenants that limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens on assets or on shares of stock or indebtedness of our subsidiaries; to engage in certain sale and lease-back transactions; and to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

Amounts available under the Program, as amended in July 2017, may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed $\n1.0\n billion. The maturities of the notes can vary, but may not exceed \n397\n days from the date of issue. The notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes are used for general corporate purposes. \nThere were \nno\n commercial paper notes outstanding as of April 28, 2023 or April 29, 2022.\nIn connection with the Program, \nwe have a senior unsecured credit agreement with a syndicated group of lenders. The credit agreement, \nwhich was amended in May 2023 primarily to replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the basis for establishing the interest rate applicable to certain borrowings under the agreement, provides for a $\n1.0\n billion revolving unsecured credit facility, with a sublimit of $\n50\n million available for the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf. The credit facility matures on \nJanuary 22, 2026\n, with an option for us to extend the maturity date for \ntwo\n additional \n1\n-year periods, subject to certain conditions. The proceeds of the loans may be used by us for general corporate purposes and as liquidity support for our existing commercial paper program. As of April 28, 2023, we \nwere compliant with all associated covenants in the agreement\n.  \nNo\n amounts were drawn against this credit facility during any of the periods presented.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9. Leases\n\u00a0\nWe lease real estate, equipment and automobiles in the U.S. and internationally. Our real estate leases, which are responsible for the majority of our aggregate ROU asset and liability balances, include leases for office space, data centers and other facilities, and as of April 28, 2023, have remaining lease terms not exceeding 19 years. Some of these leases contain options that allow us to extend or terminate the lease agreement. Our equipment leases are primarily for servers and networking equipment and as of April 28, 2023, have remaining lease terms not exceeding \n4\n years. As of April 28, 2023, our automobile leases have remaining lease terms not exceeding \n4 \nyears. All our leases are classified as operating leases except for certain immaterial equipment finance leases.\n \nIn April 2021, we entered into a lease for our new corporate headquarters located in San Jose, California, which is comprised of approximately \nthree hundred thousand\n square feet of office space and requires future minimum undiscounted payments of approximately $\n180\n million over the initial \n11\n-year lease term. The lease agreement also provides us \ntwo\n successive renewal options, each for \nfive years\n. \nThe lease commenced during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\n \n\u00a0\nThe components of lease cost related to our operating leases were as follows (in millions):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28,\n\u00a02023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29,\n\u00a02022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating lease cost\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n61\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n61\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable lease cost\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n16\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n15\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal lease cost\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n77\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n76\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nVariable lease cost is primarily attributable to amounts paid to lessors for common area maintenance and utility charges under our real estate leases.\n\u00a0\nThe supplemental cash flow information related to our operating leases is as follows (in millions):\n73\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28,\n\u00a02023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29,\n\u00a02022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n55\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n56\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease obligations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n38\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n236\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe supplemental balance sheet information related to our operating leases is as follows (in millions, except lease term and discount rate):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28,\n\u00a02023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29,\n\u00a02022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther non-current assets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n281\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n294\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal operating lease ROU assets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n281\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n294\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccrued expenses\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n47\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n47\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther long-term liabilities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n248\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n257\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal operating lease liabilities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n295\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n304\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted Average Remaining Lease Term\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9.4\n\u00a0years\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9.6\n\u00a0years\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted Average Discount Rate\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nFuture minimum operating lease payments as of April 28, 2023 are as follows (in millions):\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal Year\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAmount\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n53\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n44\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2026\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n38\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2027\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n32\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2028\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n27\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n149\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal lease payments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n343\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess: Interest\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n48\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n295\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10. Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nEquity Incentive Programs\nThe 2021 Plan\n \u2014 The 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan) was adopted by our Board of Directors and approved by the stockholders on September 10, 2021. The 2021 Plan replaced the 1999 Stock Option Plan (the 1999 Plan), and the 1999 Plan terminated effective as of September 11, 2021, except that the 1999 Plan will continue to govern awards outstanding thereunder as of the date of such plan\u2019s termination and such awards will continue in force and effect until terminated pursuant to their terms. The 2021 Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance awards to our employees, directors, and consultants.\nUnder the 2021 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to employees, nonemployee directors, consultants and independent advisors options to purchase shares of our common stock during their period of service. The exercise price for an incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot be less than \n100\n% of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. The 2021 Plan prohibits the repricing of any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right after it has been granted or to cancel any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right and immediately replace it with a new stock option or stock appreciation right with a lower exercise price unless approved by stockholders. RSUs granted under the 2021 Plan include time-based RSUs that generally vest over a \nfour-year\n period with \n25\n% vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date and \n6.25\n% vesting quarterly thereafter. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) has the discretion to use different vesting schedules. In addition, performance-based RSUs may be granted under the 2021 Plan and are subject to performance criteria and vesting terms specified by the Compensation Committee.\n As of April 28, 2023, \n1\n million shares were available for grant under the 2021 Plan.\n74\n\n\n\u00a0\nStock Options\nLess than \n1\n million stock options were outstanding as of April 28, 2023 and April 29, 2022.\n \nAdditional information related to our stock options is summarized below (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 30, 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntrinsic value of exercises\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n7\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n14\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n11\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProceeds received from exercises\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n8\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFair value of options vested\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n5\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n5\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nRestricted Stock Units\nIn fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we granted PBRSUs to certain of our executives. Each PBRSU has performance-based vesting criteria (in addition to the service-based vesting criteria) such that the PBRSU cliff-vests at the end of either an approximate one, two or \nthree year\n performance period, which began on the date specified in the grant agreement and typically ends on the last day of the first, second or third fiscal year, respectively, following the grant date. The number of shares of common stock that will be issued to settle most of these PBRSUs at the end of the applicable performance and service period will range from \n0\n% to \n200\n% of a target number of shares originally granted. For half of the PBRSUs granted in fiscal 2023 and most of the PBRSUs granted in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, the number of shares issued will depend upon our Total Stockholder Return (TSR) as compared to the TSR of a specified group of benchmark peer companies (each expressed as a growth rate percentage) calculated as of the end of the performance period. The fair values of these awards were fixed at grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. \nFor the remaining PBRSUs granted in fiscal 2023, \nthe number of shares issued will depend upon the Company's billings result average over the three-year performance period as compared to a predetermined billings target. Billings for purposes of measuring the performance of these PBRSUs means the total obtained by adding net revenues as reported on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income to the amount reported as the change in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the applicable measurement period, excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n The fair values of these billings PBRSUs were established consistent with our methodology for valuing time-based RSUs, while compensation cost was recognized based on the probable outcome of the performance condition. The aggregate grant date fair value of all PBRSUs granted in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n28\n million, $\n59\n million and $\n27\n million, respectively, and these amounts are being recognized to expense over the shorter of the remaining applicable performance or service periods.\n \nAs of April 28, 2023, April 29, 2022 and April 30, 2021, there were approximately \n1\n million PBRSUs outstanding.\nThe following table summarizes information related to RSUs, including PBRSUs, (in millions, except for fair value):\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNumber of\nShares\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date \nFair Value\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding as of April 24, 2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n51.40\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n42.46\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVested\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n44.74\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForfeited\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n51.20\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding as of April 30, 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n47.75\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n80.40\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVested\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n48.91\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForfeited\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n57.46\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding as of April 29, 2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n64.09\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n59.87\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVested\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n4\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n62.85\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForfeited\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n61.99\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding as of April 28, 2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n12\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n62.08\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWe primarily use the net share settlement approach upon vesting, where a portion of the shares are withheld as settlement of employee withholding taxes, which decreases the shares issued to the employee by a corresponding value. \nThe number and value of the shares netted for employee taxes are summarized in the table below (in millions):\n75\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 30, 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares withheld for taxes\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFair value of shares withheld\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n84\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n74\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n42\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nEligible employees are offered shares through a \n24\n-month offering period, which consists of \nfour\n consecutive \n6\n-month purchase periods.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nWe use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risk. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The maximum length of time over which forecasted foreign currency denominated revenues are hedged is 12 months. The program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet their obligations under the terms of our agreements. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. We also have in place master netting arrangements to mitigate the credit risk of our counterparties and to potentially reduce our losses due to counterparty nonperformance. We present our derivative instruments as net amounts in our consolidated balance sheets. The gross and net fair value amounts of such instruments were not material as of April 28, 2023 or April 29, 2022. All contracts have a maturity of less than 12 months.\nThe notional amount of our outstanding U.S. dollar equivalent foreign currency exchange forward contracts consisted of the following (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28,\n\u00a02023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29,\n\u00a02022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForward contracts purchased\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n95\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n78\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance Sheet Contracts\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForward contracts sold\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n965\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n841\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForward contracts purchased\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n96\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n129\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \nThe effect of cash flow hedges recognized in net revenues is presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and Note 10 \u2013 Stockholders\u2019 Equity.\n78\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments recognized in other expense, net on our consolidated statements of income was as follows (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 30, 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGain (Loss) Recognized into Income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign currency exchange contracts\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n91\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n20\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n12. Restructuring Charges\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2023, management approved a restructuring plan to redirect resources to highest return activities and reduce costs.

The transaction resulted in a step-up of tax-deductible basis in the transferred assets, and accordingly, created a temporary difference where the tax basis exceeded the financial statement basis of such intangible assets, which resulted in the recognition of a discrete tax benefit and related deferred tax asset of $\n524\n million during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.  Management applied significant judgment when determining the fair value of the IP, which serves as the tax basis of the deferred tax asset. With the assistance of third-party valuation specialists, the fair value of the IP was determined principally based on the present value of projected cash flows related to the IP which reflects management\u2019s assumptions regarding projected revenues, earnings before interest and taxes, and a discount rate. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights will be recognized in future periods and any amortization that is unused in a particular year can be carried forward indefinitely. The deferred tax asset and the tax benefit were measured based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years the asset is expected to be realized. We expect to realize the deferred tax asset resulting from the IP Transfer and will assess the realizability of the deferred tax asset quarterly. Any Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (\u201cOECD\u201d) actions adopted internationally could impact our financial results in future periods.\n\u00a0\nIn September 2010, the Danish Tax Authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 by our Danish subsidiary were subject to Danish at-source dividend withholding tax. We did not believe that our Danish subsidiary was liable for such withholding tax and filed an appeal with the Danish Tax Tribunal. In December 2011, the Danish Tax Tribunal issued a ruling in favor of NetApp. The Danish tax examination agency appealed this decision at the Danish High Court (DHC) in March 2012. In February 2016, the DHC requested a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In March 2018, the Advocate General issued an opinion which was largely in favor of NetApp. The CJEU was not bound by the opinion of the Advocate General and issued its preliminary ruling in February 2019. On May 3, 2021, the DHC reached a decision resulting in NetApp prevailing on the predominate distribution made in 2005. The smaller distribution made in 2006 was ruled in favor of the Danish Tax Authorities. On May 28, 2021, the Danish Tax Authorities appealed the DHC decision to the Danish Supreme Court. On January 9, 2023, the Danish Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision and ruled the 2005 dividend was subject to withholding tax while the smaller 2006 distribution would not be subject to withholding tax. The Danish Supreme Court ruling on the distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 is non-appealable.

The increase is mainly attributable to corresponding changes in deferred tax assets, primarily certain state tax credit carryforwards.\nAs of April 28, 2023, we have federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\n17\n million. In addition, we have gross state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $\n13\n million and $\n135\n million, respectively. The majority of the state credit carryforwards are California research credits which are offset by a valuation allowance as we believe it is more likely than not that these credits will not be utilized. We also have $\n8\n million of foreign net operating losses and $\n30\n million of foreign tax credit carryforwards of which the majority were generated by our Dutch subsidiary and are fully offset by a valuation allowance. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. \nThe \nstate and foreign net operating loss \n81\n\n\n\u00a0\ncarryforwards \nand credits will expire in various years from fiscal 2024 through 2042.\n The federal net operating loss carryforwards, the California research credit, and the Dutch foreign tax credit carryforwards do not expire.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 30, 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance at beginning of period\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n220\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n221\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n211\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecreases for tax positions of prior years\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n5\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSettlements\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n10\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(\n8\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance at end of period\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n222\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n220\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n221\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \nAs of April 28, 2023, we had $\n222\n million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $\n144\n million has been recorded in other long-term liabilities. Unrecognized tax benefits of $\n144\n million, including penalties, interest and indirect benefits, would affect our provision for income taxes if recognized.\n \nWe recognized expense for increases to accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision of approximately $\n7\n million, $\n4\n million and $\n1\n million, respectively, in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal  2021.

Transfer pricing calculations are key topics under these audits and are often subject to dispute and appeals. We are effectively subject to federal tax examination adjustments for tax years ended on or after fiscal 2001, in that we have carryforward attributes from these years that could be subject to adjustment in the tax years of utilization.\nWe continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We engage in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in multiple jurisdictions. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude, certain statutes of limitations will lapse, or both. As a result of uncertainties regarding tax audits and their possible outcomes, an estimate of the range of possible impacts to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months cannot be made at this time.\n As of April 28, 2023, we continue to record a deferred tax liability related to state taxes on unremitted earnings of certain foreign entities. We estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the earnings we expect to be indefinitely reinvested to be immaterial. We will continue to monitor our plans to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and will assess the related unrecognized deferred tax liability considering our ongoing projected global cash requirements, tax consequences associated with repatriation and any U.S. or foreign government programs designed to influence remittances.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n14.

Segment, Geographic, and Significant Customer Information\nWe have two operating segments and two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information for components of our business, organized based on category of product/solution, to evaluate performance and allocate resources. The CODM measures performance of each segment based on segment revenue and segment gross profit. We do not allocate to our segments certain cost of revenues which we manage at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We do not allocate assets to our segments.\n \nHybrid Cloud \noffers a portfolio of storage management and infrastructure solutions that help customers recast their traditional data centers with the power of cloud. This portfolio is designed to operate with public clouds to unlock the potential of hybrid, multi-cloud operations. Hybrid Cloud is composed of software, hardware, and related support, as well as professional and other services.\nPublic Cloud \noffers a portfolio of products delivered primarily as-a-service, including related support. This portfolio includes cloud storage and data services and cloud operations services. Public Cloud includes certain reseller arrangements in which the timing of our consideration follows the end user consumption of the reseller services.\nSegment Revenues and Gross Profit\nFinancial

We match \n100\n% of the first \n2\n% of eligible earnings an employee contributes to the 401(k) Plan, and then match \n50\n% of the next \n4\n% of eligible earnings an employee contributes. \nAn employee receives the full 4% match when he/she contributes at least \n6\n% of his/her eligible earnings, up to a maximum calendar year matching contribution of $\n6,000\n.\n \nOur employer matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan were as follows (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApril 30, 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n401(k) matching contributions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n33\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n31\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n29\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nWe \nhave a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that allows a group of employees within the U.S. to contribute base salary and commissions or incentive compensation on a tax deferred basis in excess of the IRS limits imposed on 401(k) plans.

Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Orders and Other Commitments\nIn the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to third-party contract manufacturers and component suppliers to manage manufacturer lead times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties, to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consist of firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments. As of April 28, 2023, we had $\n0.4\n billion in non-cancelable purchase commitments for inventory. We record a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of April 28, 2023 and April 29, 2022, such liability amounted to $\n15\n million and $\n18\n million, respectively, and is included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent that such forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change.\nIn addition to inventory commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers, we have open purchase orders and contractual obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not yet received goods or services. As of April 28, 2023, we had $\n0.3\n billion in other purchase obligations.\nOf the total $\n0.7\n billion in purchase commitments, $\n0.5\n billion is due in fiscal 2024, with the remainder due thereafter.\n \nFinancing Guarantees\nWhile most of our arrangements for sales include short-term payment terms, from time to time we provide long-term financing to creditworthy customers. We have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts\u2019 dates of execution, and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as \u201ctrue sales\u201d as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize product revenues for these arrangements, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions, upon product acceptance. We sold $\n38\n million, $\n59\n million and $\n102\n million of receivables during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n \nIn addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products. These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user and we recognize revenue upon delivery to the end-user customer, if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\n \n86\n\n\n\u00a0\nSome of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through third-party financing institutions. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally \nthree years\n or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default. These arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases and collectability is probable, we account for these transactions as sales type leases. If collectability is not probable, the cash received is recorded as a deposit liability and revenue is deferred until the arrangement is deemed collectible. For leases that we are not a party to, other than providing recourse, we recognize revenue when control is transferred. As of April 28, 2023 and April 29, 2022, the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant. To date, we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements.\nWe have entered into service contracts with certain of our end-user customers that are supported by third-party financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of our non-performance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid financing payments under such arrangements. As of April 28, 2023, we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements, and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote. The portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our consolidated balance sheets\n.\nLegal Contingencies\nWhen a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency.\nOn August 14, 2019, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, naming as defendants NetApp and certain of our executive officers. The complaint alleged that the defendants violated Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements with respect to our financial guidance for fiscal 2020, as provided on May 22, 2019, and further alleged unspecified damages based on the decline in the market price of our shares following the issuance of the revised guidance on August 1, 2019. On July 30, 2021, the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding providing for the settlement of the class action, pursuant to which NetApp agreed to pay approximately $2.0 million in connection with the settlement, which was accrued during the three months ended July 30, 2021. On September 1, 2022, the court held a final approval hearing, approved the stipulation of settlement (which contained no admission of liability, wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the parties and provided for the mutual release by all parties), and dismissed the case with prejudice.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business. We may, from time to time, receive claims that we are infringing third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, including claims for alleged patent infringement brought by non-practicing entities. We are currently involved in patent litigations brought by non-practicing entities and other third parties. We believe we have strong arguments that our products do not infringe and/or the asserted patents are invalid, and we intend to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. However, there is no guarantee that we will prevail at trial and if a jury were to find that our products infringe, we could be required to pay significant monetary damages, and may cause product shipment delays or stoppages, require us to redesign our products, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\n \nAlthough management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include significant monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and overall trends\n. \nNo\n material accrual has been recorded as of April 28, 2023 related to such matters.\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n87\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST\nERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo the stockholders and Board of Directors of NetApp, Inc.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\n\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of April 28, 2023 and April 29, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders' equity, for each of the three years in the period ended April 28, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 28, 2023 and April 29, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 28, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of April 28, 2023, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated June 14, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n\nRevenue \u2014 Refer to Notes 1, 6, and 15 to the financial statements\n\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n\n\nCertain of the Company\u2019s revenue contracts with customers include multiple promises (such as cloud services, hardware systems, software licenses, software and hardware support, and other services). The Company typically negotiates contracts with its customers, and while many of these contracts contain standard terms and conditions, certain large enterprises and distributors may have customer specific terms and performance obligations due to the nature of the contracts.\n \n\n\nPursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the Company is required to evaluate whether each performance obligation represents goods and services that are distinct. A good or service is distinct where the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and is distinct in the context of the contract, where the transfer of the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The evaluation of performance obligations can require significant judgment and could change the amount of revenue recognized in a given period.\n\n\nWe identified the evaluation of performance obligations in certain large enterprise and distributor contracts as a critical audit matter because of the judgment management makes in evaluating such contracts and the impact of such judgment on the amount of revenue recognized in a given period. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of testing.\n\n\n88\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\n\n   Our audit procedures related to the Company\u2019s evaluation of performance obligations for certain large enterprise and distributor contracts included the following, among others:\n\n\n\u2022\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls related to the review of large enterprise and distributor contracts specifically around the review of the terms and conditions and proper evaluation of performance obligations.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe evaluated management\u2019s significant accounting policies related to revenue recognition for reasonableness and compliance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe selected a sample of contracts for large enterprise and distributor customers and performed the following: \n\n\no\nObtained and read contract source documents, including master agreements, amendments, and other documents that were part of the contract. \n\n\no\nAssessed the terms and conditions in the contract source documents and evaluated the appropriateness of management\u2019s application of their accounting policies in the evaluation of performance obligations.\n\n\nIncome Taxes \u2014 Refer to Note 13 to the financial statements\n\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n\n\n   During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company completed an intra-entity asset transfer of certain Intellectual Property (\u201cIP\u201d). The transaction resulted in a step-up of tax-deductible basis in the transferred assets, and accordingly, created a temporary difference where the tax basis exceeded the financial statement basis of such intangible assets, which resulted in the recognition of a discrete tax benefit and related deferred tax asset of $524 million.\n\n\n   The Company determined the fair value of the transferred IP based principally on the present value of projected cash flows related to the IP requiring management to make significant assumptions related to the discount rate and the forecast of future revenues and earnings before interest and taxes.\n\n\n   We identified the valuation of the IP as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions made by management to estimate the fair value of the IP. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value and tax transfer pricing specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates and assumptions related to the selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future revenues and earnings before interest and taxes.\n\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\n\nOur audit procedures related to the discount rate and forecasted future revenues and earnings before interest and taxes used by management to estimate the fair value of the IP included the following, among others:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nWe tested the effectiveness of the control over management\u2019s valuation of the intra-entity IP transfer including management\u2019s selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future revenues and earnings before interest and taxes. \n\n\n\u2022\nWith the assistance of our fair value and tax transfer pricing specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rate, including testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate, testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe evaluated management\u2019s ability to accurately forecast future revenues and earnings before interest and taxes by comparing actual results to management\u2019s historical forecasts. \n\n\n\u2022\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management\u2019s forecasts of revenue and earnings before interest and taxes by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical results, (2) revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxes of comparable guideline public companies and (3) industry reports.\n \n\n\n/s/ \nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\n\nSan Jose, California\n\n\nJune 14, 2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1995.\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n\nTo the stockholders and Board of Directors of NetApp, Inc.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\n     We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of April 28, 2023, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 28, 2023, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\n\n\n     We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended April 28, 2023, of the Company and our report dated June 14, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n \n\n\n     The Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\n     We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\n     A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\n     Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\n\nSan Jose, California\n\n\nJune 14, 2023\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n90\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt\nem 9.  \nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nIt\nem 9A.  \nControls and Procedures\n\n\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\n\nThe phrase \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures\u201d refers to controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and our Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of April 28, 2023, the end of the fiscal period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Evaluation Date). Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n\n(b) Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in \nInternal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of April 28, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level based on those criteria.\n\n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 28, 2023 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\nIt\nem 9B.
