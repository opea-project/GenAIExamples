<h2>🧐 Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's features:

- Start a Text Chat：Initiate a text chat with the ability to input written conversations, where the dialogue content can also be customized based on uploaded files.
- Context Awareness: The AI assistant maintains the context of the conversation, understanding references to previous statements or questions. This allows for more natural and coherent exchanges.
- Upload File: The choice between uploading locally or copying a remote link. Chat according to uploaded knowledge base.
- Clear: Clear the record of the current dialog box without retaining the contents of the dialog box.
- Chat history: Historical chat records can still be retained after refreshing, making it easier for users to view the context.
