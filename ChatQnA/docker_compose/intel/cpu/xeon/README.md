## ChatQnA Quick Start Deployment

This section describes how to quickly deploy and test the ChatQnA service manually on an Intel® Xeon® processor. The basic steps are:

1. [Access the Code](#access-the-code)
2. [Generate a HuggingFace Access Token](#generate-a-huggingface-access-token)
3. [Configure the Deployment Environment](#configure-the-deployment-environment)
4. [Deploy the Services Using Docker Compose](#deploy-the-services-using-docker-compose)
5. [Check the Deployment Status](#check-the-deployment-status)
6. [Test the Pipeline](#test-the-pipeline)
7. [Cleanup the Deployment](#cleanup-the-deployment)

### Access the Code

Clone the GenAIExample repository and access the ChatQnA Intel® Gaudi® platform Docker Compose files and supporting scripts:

```
git clone https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIExamples.git
cd GenAIExamples/ChatQnA/docker_compose/intel/cpu/xeon/
```

Checkout a released version, such as v1.2:

```
git checkout v1.2
```

### Generate a HuggingFace Access Token

Some HuggingFace resources, such as some models, are only accessible if the developer have an access token. In the absence of a HuggingFace access token, the developer can create one by first creating an account by following the steps provided at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) and then generating a [user access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/guides/private#step-1-generating-a-user-access-token).

### Configure the Deployment Environment

To set up environment variables for deploying ChatQnA services, set up some parameters specific to the deployment environment and source the _setup_env.sh_ script in this directory:

```
export host_ip="External_Public_IP"           #ip address of the node
export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN="Your_Huggingface_API_Token"
export http_proxy="Your_HTTP_Proxy"           #http proxy if any
export https_proxy="Your_HTTPs_Proxy"         #https proxy if any
export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,$host_ip  #additional no proxies if needed
export no_proxy=$no_proxy,chatqna-xeon-ui-server,chatqna-xeon-backend-server,dataprep-redis-service,tei-embedding-service,retriever,tei-reranking-service,tgi-service,vllm-service,llm-faqgen
source ./set_env.sh
```

Consult the section on [ChatQnA Service configuration](#chatqna-configuration) for information on how service specific configuration parameters affect deployments.

### Deploy the Services Using Docker Compose

To deploy the ChatQnA services, execute the `docker compose up` command with the appropriate arguments. For a default deployment, execute the command below. It uses the 'compose.yaml' file.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To enable Open Telemetry Tracing, compose.telemetry.yaml file need to be merged along with default compose.yaml file.  
CPU example with Open Telemetry feature:

> NOTE : To get supported Grafana Dashboard, please run download_opea_dashboard.sh following below commands.

```bash
./grafana/dashboards/download_opea_dashboard.sh
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.telemetry.yaml up -d
```

**Note**: developers should build docker image from source when:

- Developing off the git main branch (as the container's ports in the repo may be different from the published docker image).
- Unable to download the docker image.
- Use a specific version of Docker image.

Please refer to the table below to build different microservices from source:

| Microservice | Deployment Guide                                                                              |

### Check the Deployment Status

After running docker compose, check if all the containers launched via docker compose have started:

```
docker ps -a
```

For the default deployment, the following 10 containers should have started:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                   COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                                                                                  NAMES

```

If any issues are encountered during deployment, refer to the [troubleshooting](../../../../README_miscellaneous.md##troubleshooting) section.

### Test the Pipeline

Once the ChatQnA services are running, test the pipeline using the following command:

```bash
curl http://${host_ip}:8888/v1/chatqna \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "messages": "What is the revenue of Nike in 2023?"
    }'
```

**Note** : Access the ChatQnA UI by web browser through this URL: `http://${host_ip}:80`. Please confirm the `80` port is opened in the firewall. To validate each microservie used in the pipeline refer to the [Validate microservicess](#validate-microservices) section.

### Cleanup the Deployment

To stop the containers associated with the deployment, execute the following command:

```
docker compose -f compose.yaml down
```

## ChatQnA Docker Compose Files

In the context of deploying a ChatQnA pipeline on an Intel® Xeon® platform, we can pick and choose different vector databases, large language model serving frameworks, and remove pieces of the pipeline such as the reranker. The table below outlines the various configurations that are available as part of the application. These configurations can be used as templates and can be extended to different components available in [GenAIComps](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIComps.git).

| File                                                         | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [compose.yaml](./compose.yaml)                               | Default compose file using vllm as serving framework and redis as vector database                      |
| [compose_milvus.yaml](./compose_milvus.yaml)                 | The vector database utilized is Milvus. All other configurations remain the same as the default        |
| [compose_pinecone.yaml](./compose_pinecone.yaml)             | The vector database utilized is Pinecone. All other configurations remain the same as the default      |
| [compose_qdrant.yaml](./compose_qdrant.yaml)                 | The vector database utilized is Qdrant. All other configurations remain the same as the default        |
| [compose_tgi.yaml](./compose_tgi.yaml)                       | The LLM serving framework is TGI. All other configurations remain the same as the default              |
| [compose_without_rerank.yaml](./compose_without_rerank.yaml) | Default configuration without the reranker                                                             |
| [compose.telemetry.yaml](./compose.telemetry.yaml)           | Helper file for telemetry features for vllm. Can be used along with any compose files that serves vllm |
| [compose_tgi.telemetry.yaml](./compose_tgi.telemetry.yaml)   | Helper file for telemetry features for tgi. Can be used along with any compose files that serves tgi   |

## ChatQnA with Conversational UI (Optional)

To access the Conversational UI (react based) frontend, modify the UI service in the `compose` file used to deploy. Replace `chaqna-xeon-ui-server` service with the `chatqna-xeon-conversation-ui-server` service as per the config below:

```yaml
chaqna-xeon-conversation-ui-server:
  image: opea/chatqna-conversation-ui:latest
  container_name: chatqna-xeon-conversation-ui-server
  environment:
    - APP_BACKEND_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=${BACKEND_SERVICE_ENDPOINT}
    - APP_DATA_PREP_SERVICE_URL=${DATAPREP_SERVICE_ENDPOINT}
  ports:
    - "5174:80"
  depends_on:
    - chaqna-xeon-backend-server
  ipc: host
  restart: always
```

Once the services are up, open the following URL in the browser: http://{host_ip}:5174. By default, the UI runs on port 80 internally. If the developer prefers to use a different host port to access the frontend, it can be modiied by port mapping in the `compose.yaml` file as shown below:

```yaml
  chaqna-gaudi-conversation-ui-server:
    image: opea/chatqna-conversation-ui:latest
    ...
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```

Here is an example of running ChatQnA (default UI):

Here is an example of running ChatQnA with Conversational UI (React):

![project-screenshot](../../../../assets/img/conversation_ui_response.png)

### Validate Microservices

Note, when verify the microservices by curl or API from remote client, please make sure the **ports** of the microservices are opened in the firewall of the cloud node.  
Follow the instructions to validate MicroServices.
For details on how to verify the correctness of the response, refer to [how-to-validate_service](../../hpu/gaudi/how_to_validate_service.md).

1. TEI Embedding Service

   ```bash
   curl http://${host_ip}:6006/embed \
       -X POST \
       -d '{"inputs":"What is Deep Learning?"}' \
       -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
   ```

2. Retriever Microservice

   To consume the retriever microservice, you need to generate a mock embedding vector by Python script. The length of embedding vector
   is determined by the embedding model.
   Here we use the model `EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID="BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5"`, which vector size is 768.

   Check the vector dimension of your embedding model, set `your_embedding` dimension equals to it.

   ```bash
   export your_embedding=$(python3 -c "import random; embedding = [random.uniform(-1, 1) for _ in range(768)]; print(embedding)")
   curl http://${host_ip}:7000/v1/retrieval \
     -X POST \
     -d "{\"text\":\"test\",\"embedding\":${your_embedding}}" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
   ```

3. TEI Reranking Service

   > Skip for ChatQnA without Rerank pipeline

   ```bash
   curl http://${host_ip}:8808/rerank \
       -X POST \
       -d '{"query":"What is Deep Learning?", "texts": ["Deep Learning is not...", "Deep learning is..."]}' \
       -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
   ```

4. LLM backend Service

   In the first startup, this service will take more time to download, load and warm up the model. After it's finished, the service will be ready.

   Try the command below to check whether the LLM serving is ready.

   ```bash
   # vLLM service
   docker logs vllm-service 2>&1 | grep complete
   # If the service is ready, you will get the response like below.
   INFO:     Application startup complete.
   ```

   ```bash
   # TGI service
   docker logs tgi-service | grep Connected
   # If the service is ready, you will get the response like below.
   2024-09-03T02:47:53.402023Z  INFO text_generation_router::server: router/src/server.rs:2311: Connected
   ```

   Then try the `cURL` command below to validate services.

   ```bash
   # either vLLM or TGI service
   curl http://${host_ip}:9009/v1/chat/completions \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is Deep Learning?"}], "max_tokens":17}' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
   ```

5. MegaService

   ```bash
    curl http://${host_ip}:8888/v1/chatqna -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
          "messages": "What is the revenue of Nike in 2023?"
          }'
   ```

6. Nginx Service

   ```bash
   curl http://${host_ip}:${NGINX_PORT}/v1/chatqna \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"messages": "What is the revenue of Nike in 2023?"}'
   ```

7. Dataprep Microservice（Optional）

If you want to update the default knowledge base, you can use the following commands:

Update Knowledge Base via Local File [nke-10k-2023.pdf](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIComps/blob/v1.1/comps/retrievers/redis/data/nke-10k-2023.pdf). Or
click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opea-project/GenAIComps/v1.1/comps/retrievers/redis/data/nke-10k-2023.pdf) to download the file via any web browser.
Or run this command to get the file on a terminal.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opea-project/GenAIComps/v1.1/comps/retrievers/redis/data/nke-10k-2023.pdf
```

Upload:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://${host_ip}:6007/v1/dataprep/ingest" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
     -F "files=@./nke-10k-2023.pdf"
```

This command updates a knowledge base by uploading a local file for processing. Update the file path according to your environment.

Add Knowledge Base via HTTP Links:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://${host_ip}:6007/v1/dataprep/ingest" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
     -F 'link_list=["https://opea.dev"]'
```

This command updates a knowledge base by submitting a list of HTTP links for processing.

Also, you are able to get the file list that you uploaded:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://${host_ip}:6007/v1/dataprep/get" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Then you will get the response JSON like this. Notice that the returned `name`/`id` of the uploaded link is `https://xxx.txt`.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "nke-10k-2023.pdf",
    "id": "nke-10k-2023.pdf",
    "type": "File",
    "parent": ""
  },
  {
    "name": "https://opea.dev.txt",
    "id": "https://opea.dev.txt",
    "type": "File",
    "parent": ""
  }
]
```

To delete the file/link you uploaded:

The `file_path` here should be the `id` get from `/v1/dataprep/get` API.

```bash
# delete link
curl -X POST "http://${host_ip}:6007/v1/dataprep/delete" \
     -d '{"file_path": "https://opea.dev.txt"}' \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# delete file
curl -X POST "http://${host_ip}:6007/v1/dataprep/delete" \
     -d '{"file_path": "nke-10k-2023.pdf"}' \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# delete all uploaded files and links
curl -X POST "http://${host_ip}:6007/v1/dataprep/delete" \
     -d '{"file_path": "all"}' \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Profile Microservices

To further analyze MicroService Performance, users could follow the instructions to profile MicroServices.

#### 1. vLLM backend Service

Users could follow previous section to testing vLLM microservice or ChatQnA MegaService.  
 By default, vLLM profiling is not enabled. Users could start and stop profiling by following commands.

##### Start vLLM profiling

```bash
curl http://${host_ip}:9009/start_profile \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"}'
```

Users would see below docker logs from vllm-service if profiling is started correctly.

```bash
INFO api_server.py:361] Starting profiler...
INFO api_server.py:363] Profiler started.
INFO:     x.x.x.x:35940 - "POST /start_profile HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

After vLLM profiling is started, users could start asking questions and get responses from vLLM MicroService  
 or ChatQnA MicroService.

##### Stop vLLM profiling

By following command, users could stop vLLM profliing and generate a \*.pt.trace.json.gz file as profiling result  
 under /mnt folder in vllm-service docker instance.

```bash
# vLLM Service
curl http://${host_ip}:9009/stop_profile \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"}'
```

Users would see below docker logs from vllm-service if profiling is stopped correctly.

```bash
INFO api_server.py:368] Stopping profiler...
INFO api_server.py:370] Profiler stopped.
INFO:     x.x.x.x:41614 - "POST /stop_profile HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

After vllm profiling is stopped, users could use below command to get the \*.pt.trace.json.gz file under /mnt folder.

```bash
docker cp  vllm-service:/mnt/ .
```

##### Check profiling result

Open a web browser and type "chrome://tracing" or "ui.perfetto.dev", and then load the json.gz file, you should be able  
 to see the vLLM profiling result as below diagram.
