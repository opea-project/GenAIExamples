# Example ChatQnA deployments on an Intel® Gaudi® Platform

This example covers the single-node on-premises deployment of the ChatQnA example using OPEA components. There are various ways to enable ChatQnA, but this example will focus on four options available for deploying the ChatQnA pipeline to Intel® Gaudi® AI Accelerators. This example begins with a Quick Start section and then documents how to modify deployments, leverage new models and configure the number of allocated devices.

This example includes the following sections:

- [ChatQnA Quick Start Deployment](#chatqna-quick-start-deployment): Demonstrates how to quickly deploy a ChatQnA application/pipeline on a Intel® Gaudi® platform.
- [ChatQnA Docker Compose Files](#chatqna-docker-compose-files): Describes some example deployments and their docker compose files.
- [ChatQnA Service Configuration](#chatqna-service-configuration): Describes the services and possible configuration changes.

**Note** This example requires access to a properly installed Intel® Gaudi® platform with a functional Docker service configured to use the habanalabs-container-runtime. Please consult the [Intel® Gaudi® software Installation Guide](https://docs.habana.ai/en/v1.20.0/Installation_Guide/Driver_Installation.html) for more information.

## ChatQnA Quick Start Deployment

This section describes how to quickly deploy and test the ChatQnA service manually on an Intel® Gaudi® platform. The basic steps are:

1. [Access the Code](#access-the-code)
2. [Generate a HuggingFace Access Token](#generate-a-huggingface-access-token)
3. [Configure the Deployment Environment](#configure-the-deployment-environment)
4. [Deploy the Services Using Docker Compose](#deploy-the-services-using-docker-compose)
5. [Check the Deployment Status](#check-the-deployment-status)
6. [Test the Pipeline](#test-the-pipeline)
7. [Cleanup the Deployment](#cleanup-the-deployment)

### Access the Code

Clone the GenAIExample repository and access the ChatQnA Intel® Gaudi® platform Docker Compose files and supporting scripts:

```
git clone https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIExamples.git
cd GenAIExamples/ChatQnA/docker_compose/intel/hpu/gaudi/
```

Checkout a released version, such as v1.2:

```
git checkout v1.2
```

### Generate a HuggingFace Access Token

Some HuggingFace resources, such as some models, are only accessible if you have an access token. If you do not already have a HuggingFace access token, you can create one by first creating an account by following the steps provided at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) and then generating a [user access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/guides/private#step-1-generating-a-user-access-token).

### Configure the Deployment Environment

To set up environment variables for deploying ChatQnA services, source the _setup_env.sh_ script in this directory:

```
source ./set_env.sh
```

The _set_env.sh_ script will prompt for required and optional environment variables used to configure the ChatQnA services. If a value is not entered, the script will use a default value for the same. It will also generate a _.env_ file defining the desired configuration. Consult the section on [ChatQnA Service configuration](#chatqna-service-configuration) for information on how service specific configuration parameters affect deployments.

### Deploy the Services Using Docker Compose

To deploy the ChatQnA services, execute the `docker compose up` command with the appropriate arguments. For a default deployment, execute:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The ChatQnA docker images should automatically be downloaded from the `OPEA registry` and deployed on the Intel® Gaudi® Platform:

```

### Test the Pipeline

Once the ChatQnA services are running, test the pipeline using the following command:

```bash
curl http://${host_ip}:8888/v1/chatqna \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "messages": "What is the revenue of Nike in 2023?"
    }'
```

**Note** The value of _host_ip_ was set using the _set_env.sh_ script and can be found in the _.env_ file.

### Cleanup the Deployment

To stop the containers associated with the deployment, execute the following command:

```
docker compose -f compose.yaml down
```

```

## ChatQnA Docker Compose Files

In the context of deploying a ChatQnA pipeline on an Intel® Gaudi® platform, the allocation and utilization of Gaudi devices across different services are important considerations for optimizing performance and resource efficiency. Each of the four example deployments, defined by the example Docker compose yaml files, demonstrates a unique approach to leveraging Gaudi hardware, reflecting different priorities and operational strategies.

### compose.yaml - Default Deployment

The default deployment utilizes Gaudi devices primarily for the `vllm-service`, which handles large language model (LLM) tasks. This service is configured to maximize the use of Gaudi's capabilities, potentially allocating multiple devices to enhance parallel processing and throughput. The `tei-reranking-service` also uses Gaudi hardware (1 card), however, indicating a balanced approach where both LLM processing and reranking tasks benefit from Gaudi's performance enhancements.

| Service Name                 | Image Name                                            | Gaudi Use    |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| redis-vector-db              | redis/redis-stack:7.2.0-v9                            | No           |
| dataprep-redis-service       | opea/dataprep:latest                                  | No           |
| tei-embedding-service        | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:cpu-1.5 | No           |
| retriever                    | opea/retriever:latest                                 | No           |
| tei-reranking-service        | ghcr.io/huggingface/tei-gaudi:1.5.0                   | 1 card       |
| vllm-service                 | opea/vllm-gaudi:latest                                | Configurable |
| chatqna-gaudi-backend-server | opea/chatqna:latest                                   | No           |
| chatqna-gaudi-ui-server      | opea/chatqna-ui:latest                                | No           |
| chatqna-gaudi-nginx-server   | opea/nginx:latest                                     | No           |

### compose_tgi.yaml - TGI Deployment

The TGI (Text Generation Inference) deployment and the default deployment differ primarily in their service configurations and specific focus on handling large language models (LLMs). The TGI deployment includes a unique `tgi-service`, which utilizes the `ghcr.io/huggingface/tgi-gaudi:2.0.6` image and is specifically configured to run on Gaudi hardware. This service is designed to handle LLM tasks with optimizations such as `ENABLE_HPU_GRAPH` and `USE_FLASH_ATTENTION`. The `chatqna-gaudi-backend-server` in the TGI deployment depends on the `tgi-service`, whereas in the default deployment, it relies on the `vllm-service`.

| Service Name                 | Image Name                                            | Gaudi Specific |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| redis-vector-db              | redis/redis-stack:7.2.0-v9                            | No             |
| dataprep-redis-service       | opea/dataprep:latest                                  | No             |
| tei-embedding-service        | ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:cpu-1.5 | No             |
| retriever                    | opea/retriever:latest                                 | No             |
| tei-reranking-service        | ghcr.io/huggingface/tei-gaudi:1.5.0                   | 1 card         |
| **tgi-service**              | ghcr.io/huggingface/tgi-gaudi:2.0.6                   | Configurable   |
| chatqna-gaudi-backend-server | opea/chatqna:latest                                   | No             |
| chatqna-gaudi-ui-server      | opea/chatqna-ui:latest                                | No             |
| chatqna-gaudi-nginx-server   | opea/nginx:latest                                     | No             |

This deployment may allocate more Gaudi resources to the tgi-service to optimize LLM tasks depending on the specific configuration and workload requirements.

### compose_without_rerank.yaml - No ReRank Deployment

The _compose_without_rerank.yaml_ Docker Compose file is distinct from the default deployment primarily due to the exclusion of the reranking service. In this version, the `tei-reranking-service`, which is typically responsible for providing reranking capabilities for text embeddings and is configured to run on Gaudi hardware, is absent. This omission simplifies the service architecture by removing a layer of processing that would otherwise enhance the ranking of text embeddings. Consequently, the `chatqna-gaudi-backend-server` in this deployment uses a specialized image, `opea/chatqna-without-rerank:latest`, indicating that it is tailored to function without the reranking feature. As a result, the backend server's dependencies are adjusted, without the need for the reranking service. This streamlined setup may impact the application's functionality and performance by focusing on core operations without the additional processing layer provided by reranking, potentially making it more efficient for scenarios where reranking is not essential and freeing Intel® Gaudi® accelerators for other tasks.

| chatqna-gaudi-ui-server      | opea/chatqna-ui:latest                                | No             |
| chatqna-gaudi-nginx-server   | opea/nginx:latest                                     | No             |

This setup might allow for more Gaudi devices to be dedicated to the `vllm-service`, enhancing LLM processing capabilities and accommodating larger models. However, it also means that the benefits of reranking are sacrificed, which could impact the overall quality of the pipeline's output.

### compose_guardrails.yaml - Guardrails Deployment

The _compose_guardrails.yaml_ Docker Compose file introduces enhancements over the default deployment by incorporating additional services focused on safety and ChatQnA response control. Notably, it includes the `tgi-guardrails-service` and `guardrails` services. The `tgi-guardrails-service` uses the `ghcr.io/huggingface/tgi-gaudi:2.0.6` image and is configured to run on Gaudi hardware, providing functionality to manage input constraints and ensure safe operations within defined limits. The guardrails service, using the `opea/guardrails:latest` image, acts as a safety layer that interfaces with the `tgi-guardrails-service` to enforce safety protocols and manage interactions with the large language model (LLM). Additionally, the `chatqna-gaudi-backend-server` is updated to use the `opea/chatqna-guardrails:latest` image, indicating its design to integrate with these new guardrail services. This backend server now depends on the `tgi-guardrails-service` and `guardrails`, alongside existing dependencies like `redis-vector-db`, `tei-embedding-service`, `retriever`, `tei-reranking-service`, and `vllm-service`. The environment configurations for the backend are also updated to include settings for the guardrail services.

| tei-reranking-service        | ghcr.io/huggingface/tei-gaudi:1.5.0                   | 1 card         | No       |
| vllm-service                 | opea/vllm-gaudi:latest                                | Configurable   | Yes      |
| chatqna-gaudi-backend-server | opea/chatqna-guardrails:latest                        | No             | No       |
| chatqna-gaudi-ui-server      | opea/chatqna-ui:latest                                | No             | No       |
| chatqna-gaudi-nginx-server   | opea/nginx:latest                                     | No             | No       |

The deployment with guardrails introduces additional Gaudi-specific services, such as the `tgi-guardrails-service`, which necessitates careful consideration of Gaudi allocation. This deployment aims to balance safety and performance, potentially requiring a strategic distribution of Gaudi devices between the guardrail services and the LLM tasks to maintain both operational safety and efficiency.

### Telemetry Enablement - compose.telemetry.yaml and compose_tgi.telemetry.yaml

The telemetry Docker Compose files are incremental configurations designed to enhance existing deployments by integrating telemetry metrics, thereby providing valuable insights into the performance and behavior of certain services. This setup modifies specific services, such as the `tgi-service`, `tei-embedding-service` and `tei-reranking-service`, by adding a command-line argument that specifies an OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) endpoint. This enables these services to export telemetry data to a designated endpoint, facilitating detailed monitoring and analysis. The `chatqna-gaudi-backend-server` is configured with environment variables that enable telemetry and specify the telemetry endpoint, ensuring that the backend server's operations are also monitored.

Additionally, the telemetry files introduce a new service, `jaeger`, which uses the `jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest` image. Jaeger is a powerful open-source tool for tracing and monitoring distributed systems, offering a user-friendly interface for visualizing traces and understanding the flow of requests through the system.

To enable Open Telemetry Tracing, compose.telemetry.yaml file needs to be merged along with default compose.yaml file on deployment:

```
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.telemetry.yaml up -d
```

For a TGI Deployment, this would become:

```
docker compose -f compose_tgi.yaml -f compose_tgi.telemetry.yaml up -d
```

Many of these services provide pipeline support required for all ChatQnA deployments, and are not specific to supporting the Intel® Gaudi® platform. Therefore, while the `redis-vector-db`, `dataprep-redis-service`, `retriever`, `chatqna-gaudi-backend-server`, `chatqna-gaudi-ui-server`, `chatqna-gaudi-nginx-server`, `jaeger` are configurable, they will not be covered by this example, which will focus on the configuration specifics of the services modified to support the Intel® Gaudi® platform.

### vllm-service & tgi-service

In the configuration of the `vllm-service` and the `tgi-service`, two variables play a primary role in determining the service's performance and functionality: `LLM_MODEL_ID` and `NUM_CARDS`. Both can be set using the appropriate environment variables. The `LLM_MODEL_ID` parameter specifies the particular large language model (LLM) that the service will utilize, effectively determining the capabilities and characteristics of the language processing tasks it can perform. This model identifier ensures that the service is aligned with the specific requirements of the application, whether it involves text generation, comprehension, or other language-related tasks. The `NUM_CARDS` parameter dictates the number of Gaudi devices allocated to the service. A higher number of Gaudi devices can enhance parallel processing capabilities, reduce latency, and improve throughput.

However, developers need to be aware of the models that have been tested with the respective service image supporting the `vllm-service` and `tgi-service`. For example, documentation for the OPEA GenAIComps v1.0 release specify the list of [validated LLM models](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIComps/blob/v1.0/comps/llms/text-generation/README.md#validated-llm-models) for each Gaudi enabled service image. Specific models may have stringent requirements on the number of Intel® Gaudi® devices required to support them.

#### Deepseek Model Support for Intel® Gaudi® Platform ChatQnA pipeline

ChatQnA now supports running the latest DeepSeek models, including [deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) and [deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) on Gaudi accelerators. To run `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B`, set the `LLM_MODEL_ID` appropriately and the `NUM_CARDS` to 8. To run `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B`, update the `LLM_MODEL_ID` appropriately and set the `NUM_CARDS` to 4.

### tei-embedding-service & tei-reranking-service

The `ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:cpu-1.5` image supporting `tei-embedding-service` and `tei-reranking-service` depends on the `EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID` or `RERANK_MODEL_ID` environment variables respectively to specify the embedding model and reranking model used for converting text into vector representations and rankings. This choice impacts the quality and relevance of the embeddings rerankings for various applications. Unlike the `vllm-service`, the `tei-embedding-service` and `tei-reranking-service` each typically acquires only one Gaudi device and does not use the `NUM_CARDS` parameter; embedding and reranking tasks generally do not require extensive parallel processing and one Gaudi per service is appropriate. The list of [supported embedding and reranking models](https://github.com/huggingface/tei-gaudi?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-models) can be found at the the [huggingface/tei-gaudi](https://github.com/huggingface/tei-gaudi?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-models) website.

### tgi-gaurdrails-service

The `tgi-guardrails-service` uses the `GUARDRAILS_MODEL_ID` parameter to select a [supported model](https://github.com/huggingface/tgi-gaudi?tab=readme-ov-file#tested-models-and-configurations) for the associated `ghcr.io/huggingface/tgi-gaudi:2.0.6` image. Like the `tei-embedding-service` and `tei-reranking-service` services, it doesn't use the `NUM_CARDS` parameter.

## Conclusion

In examining the various services and configurations across different deployments, developers should gain a comprehensive understanding of how each component contributes to the overall functionality and performance of a ChatQnA pipeline on an Intel® Gaudi® platform. Key services such as the `vllm-service`, `tei-embedding-service`, `tei-reranking-service`, and `tgi-guardrails-service` each consume Gaudi accelerators, leveraging specific models and hardware resources to optimize their respective tasks. The `LLM_MODEL_ID`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID`, `RERANK_MODEL_ID`, and `GUARDRAILS_MODEL_ID` parameters specify the models used, directly impacting the quality and effectiveness of language processing, embedding, reranking, and safety operations.

The allocation of Gaudi devices, affected by the Gaudi dependent services and the `NUM_CARDS` parameter supporting the `vllm-service` or `tgi-service`, determines where computational power is utilized to enhance performance.

Overall, the strategic configuration of these services, through careful selection of models and resource allocation, enables a balanced and efficient deployment. This approach ensures that the ChatQnA pipeline can meet diverse operational needs, from high-performance language model processing to robust safety protocols, all while optimizing the use of available hardware resources.
