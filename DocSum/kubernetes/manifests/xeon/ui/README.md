# Deploy DocSum with ReactUI

The README provides a step-by-step guide on how to deploy DocSum with ReactUI, a popular React-based user interface library in Kubernetes cluster.

You can use react-docsum.yaml to deploy Docsum with reactUI.
```
kubectl apply -f react-docsum.yaml
```

## Prerequisites for Deploying DocSum with ReactUI
Before deploying the react-docsum.yaml file, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Kubernetes installation: Make sure that you have Kubernetes installed.
2. Configuration Values: Set the following values in react-docsum.yaml before proceeding with the deployment:
    a. HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN (Your HuggingFace token to download your desired model from HuggingFace):
       ```
       # You may set the HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN via method:
       export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN="YourOwnToken"
       cd GenAIExamples/DocSum/kubernetes/manifests/xeon/ui/
       sed -i "s/insert-your-huggingface-token-here/${HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN}/g" react-docsum.yaml
       ```
    b. Set the proxies based on your network configuration
       ```
       # Look for http_proxy, https_proxy, no_proxy key and fill up the value with your proxy configuration.
       ```
3. MODEL_ID and model-volume (OPTIONAL): You may as well customize the "MODEL_ID" to use different model and model-volume for the volume to be mounted.
4. After completing these, you can proceed with the deployment of the react-docsum.yaml file.

## Verify Services
Make sure all the pods are running, you should see total of 4 pods running:

- docsum
- docsum-llm-uservice
- docsum-react-ui
- docsum-tgi

You may open up the UI by using the docsum-react-ui endpoint in the browser.
