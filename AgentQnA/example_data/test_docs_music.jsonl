It reached number one in Belgium, France and Spain, and the top ten in many other countries. In the week of Jackson's death in 2009, it was Jackson's bestselling track in the US, with sales of 167,000 copies on the Billboard Hot Digital Tracks chart. It entered the Billboard Hot Digital Singles Chart at number two, and remained in the charts' top ten for three consecutive weeks. \"Thriller\" is certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America. It appears on several of Jackson's greatest-hits albums and has been covered by numerous artists. The song has returned to the Billboard Hot 100 chart multiple times due to its popularity around Halloween.\nComposition[edit]\n\"Thriller\"\nJackson's song \"Thriller\", released as a single in 1984; Nelson George wrote that it uses cinematic sound effects, horror film motifs, and vocal trickery to convey a sense of danger.[4]\nProblems playing this file?

Instead, they wanted something \"mysterious\" to match Jackson's \"evolving persona\".[8] Temperton considered several titles, including \"Midnight Man\", which Jones felt was \"going in the right direction\". Finally, he conceived \"Thriller\", but worried that it was \"a crap word to sing ... It sounded terrible! However, we got Michael to spit it into the microphone a few times and it worked.\"[8]\nWith the title decided, Temperton wrote lyrics within \"a couple of hours\".[8] He envisioned a spoken-word sequence for the ending, but did not know what form it should take. It was decided to have a famous voice from the horror genre perform it, and Jones' then-wife, Peggy Lipton, suggested her friend Vincent Price.[6] Temperton composed the words for Price's part in a taxi on the way to the studio on the day of recording.[6]\nRecording[edit]\nQuincy Jones produced \"Thriller\"."}

Some background vocals were recorded in the Westlake shower stall.[6]\nThe bassline was performed on an ARP 2600 synthesizer, and the verse pads were performed on a Roland Jupiter-8 layered with a Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 and a Yamaha CS-80.[11] The percussion was created with a LinnDrum drum machine modified with sound chips from two other drum machines: a snare hi-hat and congas from an LM-1 and a clap from a TR-808. \"Thriller\" also features Rhodes piano performed by Greg Phillinganes and guitar performed by David Williams.[12]\nTo record the wolf howls, Swedien set up tape recorders up around his Great Dane in a barn overnight, but the dog never howled. Instead, Jackson recorded the howls himself.[13] For the creaking doors, Swedien rented doors designed for sound effects from the Universal Studios Lot and recorded the hinges.[13] Price recorded his part in two takes; Jones, acknowledging that doing a voice-over for a song is difficult, praised Price and described his takes as \"fabulous\".[6]\nRelease[edit]\nThe album Thriller was released in November 1982 on Epic Records and spent months at the top of the Billboard 200.[14] \"Thriller\" was not initially planned for release as a single, as Epic saw it as a novelty song.[15] The Epic executive Walter Yetnikoff asked: \"Who wants a single about monsters?\"[14]"}

Jackson, who was \"obsessive\" about his sales figures,[14] urged Yetnikoff and another Epic executive, Larry Stessel, to help conceive a plan to return the album to the top of the charts. Jackson's manager Frank DiLeo suggested releasing \"Thriller\", backed by a new music video.[14][16] It was the final single from the album, released in January 1984.[15]\nAlternative versions of \"Thriller\", including the \"Starlight\" demo, were released on the anniversary reissue Thriller 40 (2022).[17]\nMusic video[edit]\nMain article: Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)\nThe music video for \"Thriller\" references numerous horror films,[14] and stars Jackson performing a dance routine with a horde of the undead.[14] It was directed by the horror director John Landis and written by Landis and Jackson. Jackson contacted Landis after seeing his film An American Werewolf in London. The pair conceived a 13-minute short film with a budget much larger than previous music videos. Jackson's record company refused to finance it, believing Thriller had peaked, so a making-of documentary, Making Michael Jackson's Thriller, was produced to receive financing from television networks.[14]\nMichael Jackson's Thriller premiered on MTV on December 2, 1983.[18] It was launched to great anticipation and played regularly on MTV.[18]\nIt doubled sales of Thriller, and the documentary sold over a million copies, becoming the best-selling videotape at the time.[14] It is credited for transforming music videos into a serious art form, breaking down racial barriers in popular entertainment, and popularizing the making-of documentary format.[19]"}
