# Guardrails Microservice

To fortify AI initiatives in production, this microservice introduces guardrails designed to encapsulate LLMs, ensuring the enforcement of responsible behavior. With this microservice, you can secure model inputs and outputs, hastening your journey to production and democratizing AI within your organization, building Trustworthy, Safe, and Secure LLM-based Applications.

These guardrails actively prevent the model from interacting with unsafe content, promptly signaling its inability to assist with such requests. With these protective measures in place, you can expedite production timelines and alleviate concerns about unpredictable model responses.

The Guardrails Microservice now offers two primary types of guardrails:

- Input Guardrails: These are applied to user inputs. An input guardrail can either reject the input, halting further processing.
- Output Guardrails: These are applied to outputs generated by the LLM. An output guardrail can reject the output, preventing it from being returned to the user.

We offer content moderation support utilizing Meta's [Llama Guard](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/LlamaGuard-7b) model.

Any content that is detected in the following categories is determined as unsafe:

- Violence and Hate
- Sexual Content
- Criminal Planning
- Guns and Illegal Weapons
- Regulated or Controlled Substances
- Suicide & Self Harm

# 🚀Start Microservice with Python

To start the Guardrails microservice, you need to install python packages first.

## Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Start TGI Gaudi Service Manually

```bash
export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=${your_hf_api_token}
volume=$PWD/data
model_id="meta-llama/LlamaGuard-7b"
docker pull ghcr.io/huggingface/tgi-gaudi:1.2.1
docker run -p 8088:80 -v $volume:/data --runtime=habana -e HABANA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all -e OMPI_MCA_btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism=none --cap-add=sys_nice --ipc=host -e HTTPS_PROXY=$https_proxy -e HTTP_PROXY=$https_proxy ghcr.io/huggingface/tgi-gaudi:1.2.1 --model-id $model_id
```

## Verify the TGI Gaudi Service

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8088/generate \
  -X POST \
  -d '{"inputs":"How do you buy a tiger in the US?","parameters":{"max_new_tokens":32}}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

## Start Guardrails Service with Python Script

```bash
export SAFETY_GUARD_ENDPOINT="http://${your_ip}:8088"
python langchain/guardrails_tgi_gaudi.py
```

# 🚀Start Microservice with Docker

If you start an Guardrails microservice with docker, the `docker_compose_guardrails.yaml` file will automatically start a TGI gaudi service with docker.

## Setup Environment Variables

In order to start TGI and LLM services, you need to setup the following environment variables first.

```bash
export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=${your_hf_api_token}
export SAFETY_GUARD_ENDPOINT="http://${your_ip}:8088"
export LLM_MODEL_ID=${your_hf_llm_model}
```

## Build Docker Image

```bash
cd ../../
docker build -t opea/gen-ai-comps:guardrails-tgi-gaudi-server --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy -f comps/guardrails/langchain/docker/Dockerfile .
```

## Run Docker with CLI

```bash
docker run -d --name="guardrails-tgi-server" -p 9090:9090 --ipc=host -e http_proxy=$http_proxy -e https_proxy=$https_proxy -e SAFETY_GUARD_ENDPOINT=$SAFETY_GUARD_ENDPOINT -e HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=$HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN opea/gen-ai-comps:guardrails-tgi-gauid-server
```

## Run Docker with Docker Compose

```bash
cd langchain/docker
docker compose -f docker_compose_guardrails.yaml up -d
```
