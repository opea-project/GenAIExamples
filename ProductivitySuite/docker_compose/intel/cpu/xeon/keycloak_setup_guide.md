# üîê Keycloak Configuration Setup

This README document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on how to configure **Keycloak** settings. The user management is facilitated via Keycloak, and the configuration is outlined below:

1. Access the Keycloak admin console via url http:${host_ip}:8080 or endpoint that is exposed from your Kubernetes cluster to configure users. Use the default username(**admin**) and password(**admin**) to login.
