## Introduction

GenAIComps-based Generative AI examples offer streamlined deployment, testing, and scalability. All examples are fully compatible with Docker and Kubernetes, supporting a wide range of hardware platforms such as Gaudi, Xeon, and other hardwares.

## Architecture

[GenAIComps](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIComps) is a service-based tool that includes microservice components such as llm, embedding, reranking, and so on. Using these components, various examples in GenAIExample can be constructed, including ChatQnA, DocSum, etc.

[GenAIInfra](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIInfra), part of the OPEA containerization and cloud-native suite, enables quick and efficient deployment of GenAIExamples in the cloud.

[GenAIEval](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIEval) measures service performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and accuracy for GenAIExamples. This feature helps users compare performance across various hardware configurations easily.

## Getting Started

GenAIExamples offers flexible deployment options that cater to different user needs, enabling efficient use and deployment in various environments. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the three primary methods: Python startup, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes.

Users can choose the most suitable approach based on ease of setup, scalability needs, and the environment in which they are operating.

### Deployment Guide

Deployment are based on released docker images by default, check [docker image list](./docker_images_list.md) for detailed information. You can also build your own images following instructions.

#### Prerequisite

- For Docker Compose based deployment, you should have docker compose installed. Refer to [docker compose install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- For Kubernetes based deployment, we provide 3 ways from the easiest manifests to powerful [GMC](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIInfra/tree/main/microservices-connector) based deployment.
  - You should have a kubernetes cluster ready for use. If not, you can refer to [k8s install](https://github.com/opea-project/docs/tree/main/guide/installation/k8s_install) to deploy one.
  - (Optional) You should have GMC installed to your kubernetes cluster if you want to try with GMC. Refer to [GMC install](https://github.com/opea-project/docs/blob/main/guide/installation/gmc_install/gmc_install.md) for more information.
  - (Optional) You should have Helm (version >= 3.15) installed if you want to deploy with Helm Charts. Refer to the [Helm Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for more information.
